Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:

•

Portfolio of market-leading connectivity and sensors
businesses.

We are a leader in many of the markets we serve, and the opportunity for growth in those markets is significant. We believe
our three segments serve a combined market of approximately $170 billion that is expected to grow at an estimated annual growth rate of approximately 6% over the next five years.

•

Global leader in passive components.

With net sales of
$12.2 billion in fiscal 2015, we are significantly larger than many of our competitors. In the fragmented connector industry, which we estimated to be approximately $50 billion in fiscal
2015, our net sales were approximately $8.4 billion. We have established a global leadership position in the connector industry.

Our
scale provides us the opportunity to accelerate our sales growth by making larger investments in existing and new technologies and businesses in our core markets, and to expand our presence in
emerging markets. Our leadership position also provides us the opportunity to lower our purchasing costs by developing lower cost sources of supply and to maintain a flexible manufacturing footprint
worldwide that is close to our customers' locations.

•

Strong customer relationships.

As an industry leader, we
have established close working relationships with many of our customers. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and



respond
to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we are able to identify and act
on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products.

•

We employ
approximately 7,200 engineers dedicated to product research, development, and engineering. Our investment of over $625 million in product and process engineering and development and our capital
spending of $600 million in fiscal 2015 enable us to consistently provide innovative, high-quality products with efficient manufacturing methods. In fiscal 2015, we derived approximately 20% of
our net sales from new products, including product extensions, introduced within the previous three fiscal years.

•

Diverse product mix and customer base.

We manufacture and
sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back
many years. We believe that this diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets, thereby
reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our
competitors.

•

Global presence.

We have an established manufacturing
presence in over 20 countries and global sales distribution. Our global coverage positions us near our customers' locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering
their production costs. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile.

•

Strong management team and employee base.

We believe our
management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our chief executive officer, president, and segment leaders average
approximately 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in
the industry.

We
have employees located throughout the world. We continue to emphasize employee development and training, and we embrace diversity and inclusion. Our strong employee base, along with their
commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company's success.

Segments

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing
technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as
available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual
property claims of others.

We
own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents
and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent
protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.

While
we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by
any single patent or group of related patents.

Employees

As of September 25, 2015, we employed approximately 72,000 people worldwide, of whom 22,000 were in the Americas region, 25,000
were in the Asia–Pacific region, and 25,000 were in the EMEA region. Of our total employees, approximately 45,000 were employed in manufacturing.

Government Regulation and Supervision

The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the United States ("U.S.") and other countries. A small portion of our
products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance
organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our
ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.

Environmental

Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge
of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials in products, and chemical usage. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees
and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards; staff dedicated to



environmental,
health, and safety issues; periodic compliance auditing; training; and other measures. We also have a program for compliance with the European Union ("EU") Restriction of Hazardous
Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronics Equipment Directives, the China Restriction of Hazardous Substances law, the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals
("REACH") Regulation, and similar laws.

Compliance
with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. For example, laws regarding product content and
chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase our costs for energy and certain
materials and products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past
operations. Based upon our experience, current information, and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of $16 million to
$38 million, and that the best estimate within this range is $19 million. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 for environmental control facilities
or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.

Corporate History

We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of
association, and our Swiss organizational regulations.

Our
business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions, from fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2002, of established electronics companies and divisions, including AMP
Incorporated, Raychem Corporation, the Electromechanical Components Division of Siemens, and the OEM Division of Thomas & Betts. These companies each had more than 50 years of history in
engineering and innovation excellence. We operated as a segment of Tyco International plc ("Tyco International") prior to our separation.

Tyco
Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco International. Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of our
shares, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders (referred to in this report as the "separation"). We became an independent, publicly traded
company owning the former electronics
businesses of Tyco International. On January 26, 2015, Covidien was acquired and now operates as a subsidiary of Medtronic plc.

In
March 2011, our shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of association to change our name from "Tyco Electronics Ltd." to "TE Connectivity Ltd." The name
change was effective March 10, 2011. Our ticker symbol "TEL" on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") remained unchanged.

We
acquired Measurement Specialties, Inc. ("Measurement Specialties") and divested our Broadband Network Solutions ("BNS") business in fiscal 2015. See Notes 4 and 5 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations and acquisitions.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks described
below are not the only ones facing us. Our business also is subject to general risks that affect many other companies. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are
immaterial may also impair our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Risks Relating to Our Business

Conditions in global or regional economies, capital and money markets, and banking systems and
cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally, including
the cost and availability of consumer and business credit, end demand from consumer and industrial markets, and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on
sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults, any of which could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow, and ability to obtain financing. As a
result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full. Further, our vendors
may experience similar problems, which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels. If regional or global economic conditions deteriorate, our results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Also, deterioration in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill
or other long-lived assets. Impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and financial position.

We are dependent on the automotive and other industries.

We are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products, and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and
reduced demand in these markets. Periodic downturns in our customers' industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Approximately
39% of our net sales for fiscal 2015 were to customers in the automotive industry. The automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant
price pressure on their suppliers. Additionally, the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit
conditions. As a supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global
or regional economic and credit conditions and changes in the operations, products, business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automotive manufacturers, as
well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers.



During
fiscal 2015, approximately 11% of our net sales were to customers in the data and devices end market, 11% of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end
market, and 9% of our net sales were to customers in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market. The data and devices industry can experience variability in demand depending on the underlying
business and consumer demand for computer and consumer electronics products, as well as the market share of our customers. Demand for industrial equipment is dependent upon economic conditions. The
aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand, depending on worldwide economic and political conditions. Demand in the oil and gas market is impacted by oil price
volatility.

We encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry.

We operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components, and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase
in the future. Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price, quality, and performance of our products; the level of customer service; the development of new
technology; our ability to participate in emerging markets; and customers' expectations relating to socially responsible operations. The competition we experience across product lines from other
companies ranges in size from large, diversified manufacturers to small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in
recent years, and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price, and in some instances may
enjoy lower production costs for certain products. We cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing
or new competitors. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

We are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for
future revenue.

Substantially all of the markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences,
which are rapid in certain end markets. Our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design, develop, introduce, and sell new and innovative products; to modify existing
products; and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change. There are numerous risks inherent in these processes, including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate
the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands.

Like other suppliers to the electronics industry, we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our
prices.

We have historically experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, continuing pressure to lower our prices. In recent years, we
have experienced price erosion averaging from 1% to 2% each year. In order to maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot provide assurance that continuing
pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.

We are a large buyer of resin, copper, gold, silver, brass, steel, chemicals and additives, zinc, and other precious metals. Many of
these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, the price of many of these raw materials,
including gold and copper, continues to fluctuate. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if we have



difficulty
obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials. Any of these events could have a
substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and, to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers, our margins
may decline, materially affecting our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In addition, we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices. The
success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials. We could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are
inaccurate.

In
accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin,
tantalum, tungsten, or gold ("conflict minerals" or "3TG") mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo ("DRC") and adjoining countries (together with the DRC, the "Covered Countries") in their
products. These requirements, which were effective for the calendar year beginning January 1, 2013, could affect the sourcing, pricing, and availability of 3TG used in the manufacture of
certain of our products. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3TG from the Covered Countries, and we cannot provide assurance that
we will be able to obtain non-conflict 3TG in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other
stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures.

Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results.

A significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S., and changes in the relative values of currencies may have a
significant effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We
are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue. Approximately 52% of our net sales for fiscal 2015 were invoiced in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar, and we expect non-U.S. dollar revenue to represent a significant and likely increased portion of our future net revenue. We have elected not to hedge this foreign currency
exposure. Therefore, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the euro or Asian currencies, our U.S. dollar reported revenue
and income will decrease.

We
manage certain cash, intercompany, and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by
the counterparty to these contracts, our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful.

We may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate.

Many of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become more
concentrated in recent years, including the automotive, computer, and aerospace and defense industries. Consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us. In addition, as our
customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase. Our materials suppliers
similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends may adversely affect the profit margins on our products, particularly for commodity components.



The life cycles of our products can be very short.

The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle. As a result, the resources devoted to
product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering
expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover, and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our results of operations, financial position, and cash
flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Future acquisitions may not be successful.

We regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses, product lines, or technologies which have the potential to
strengthen our market position or enhance
our existing product offerings. We cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future. We also cannot provide assurance that
completed acquisitions will be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity.

If we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash, the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks,
public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other
leverage measures. We cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to make an acquisition partially or
wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares.

Our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain executive
management employees and limitations affecting retention and hiring, including Swiss regulations, could have a negative impact on our business and increase our expenses.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our executive management employees and hire new
executive management employees to replace, succeed, or add to members of our executive management team. Our executive management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to
replace. Competition for executive talent is intense, and we compete for these personnel with other companies that are regulated by the laws of jurisdictions that provide significantly greater
flexibility than Switzerland, our jurisdiction of incorporation, in compensation practices for executive management employees.

We could suffer significant business interruptions.

Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers, and the supply chains that support their operations, may be vulnerable to
interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, or floods; or other disasters such as fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war, disease, or failures of management
information or other systems due to internal or external causes. If a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize
the impact of these events, our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.



We may use components and products manufactured by third parties.

We may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to
manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality
control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. If these third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and components on time and at reasonable prices,
we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged.

Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary
nature of our products and technology.

The electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry,
companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or
invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the importance of the technology, product, patent,
trademark, or trade secret in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere
with our operations, compromise confidential information, and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation.

Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations; compromise
information belonging to us, our employees, customers, and suppliers; and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely
on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business
processes and activities. Additionally, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information and customer and employee data, and may have access to confidential or personal
information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and
third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, our information technology networks and
infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or
utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption
in operations, and damage to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our
information technology networks and infrastructure, to date none of these threats has had a material impact on our business or operations.

A decline in the market value of our pension plans' investment portfolios or a reduction in returns
on plan assets could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Concerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with concerns about credit, inflation, or deflation, have caused and could
continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities, including fixed income and equity securities, which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans'
investment portfolios. In addition, the expected returns on plan assets may not be



achieved.
A decrease in the value of our pension plans' investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position,
and cash flows.

Disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access
sufficient funding.

The global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted, which has reduced the availability of
investment capital and credit. Recent downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital. As a result, we may be unable to access adequate funding
to operate and grow our business. Our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures. The
extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity,
the cost of financing, and other general economic and business conditions.

Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures. Any
divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial position. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel; the diversion of management's attention from
other business concerns; the disruption of our business; and the potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant
risks encountered.

If any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or
applicable trade regulations, our business may suffer.

Our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in
particular the U.S. and the EU. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic
components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We may also be subject to third-party claims for damages. Further, agreements
that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce our
commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, any
failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction, which could negatively
impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are subject to global risks of political, economic, and military instability.

Our workforce; manufacturing, research, administrative, and sales facilities; markets; customers; and suppliers are located throughout
the world. As a result, we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including:

•

tariffs, trade barriers, and trade disputes;

•

regulations related to customs and import/export matters;



•

variations in lengths of payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable;

•

tax law and regulatory changes in the U.S. and EU among other jurisdictions, including tax law and regulatory changes that may be
effected as a result of tax policy recommendations from quasi-governmental organizations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD"), examinations by taxing
authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country, changes to the terms of income tax treaties, and difficulties in the tax-efficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of
jurisdictions;

•

employment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which
we currently operate;

•

difficulties protecting intellectual property;

•

instability in economic or political conditions, including sovereign debt levels, Eurozone uncertainty, inflation, recession, and
actual or anticipated military or political conflicts; and

•

the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements.

We
have sizeable operations in China, including 14 manufacturing sites. In addition, approximately 18% of our net sales in fiscal 2015 were made to customers in China. Economic
conditions in China have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain. In addition, the legal system in China is still developing and is subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders
for products in China could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions or interpretation of Chinese law.

In
addition, any downgrade by rating agencies of long-term U.S. sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets
and economic conditions, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and liquidity.

We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United
Kingdom's Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom's Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit
companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery
laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local
customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts
committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, government
enforcement actions, and reputational risk.

We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various
countries where we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment;

•

investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites;

•

greenhouse gas emissions;



•

product hazardous material content; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

We
may not have been, or we may not at all times be, in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. If we violate these laws, we could be fined,
criminally charged, or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or
materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigation, removal, and remediation costs under certain federal and state laws is
retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or
exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerly-owned sites
where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs
of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites. We also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation and/or
remediation is necessary.

While
we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future
environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or
exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional
environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present, or future business activities.

Our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material
content, and recycling.

The EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing
environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other
related matters. These laws include the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances, End of Life Vehicle, and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives; the EU REACH Regulation; the China law on
Management Methods for Controlling Pollution by Electronic Information Products; and various other laws. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and
directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. These laws continue to proliferate
and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive
or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions.

We are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

In the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual
property rights, anti-competitive behavior, product liability, breach of contract, and employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful
plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert



our
management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or
other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on
the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (as defined in the Credit Facility) and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens. Our
outstanding notes' indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability to consolidate, merge, and sell assets.

Although
none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our continued ability to meet the Credit Facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our
control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility or indentures. Upon the
occurrence of certain defaults under our Credit Facility and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our
lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our Credit Facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have
sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration of any
debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder.

The
indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or
access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of
a change of control triggering event.

Risks Relating to Our Separation from Tyco International

We share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax
liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date.

In connection with the separation from Tyco International in 2007, we, Tyco International, and Covidien (which on January 26,
2015, was acquired and now operates as a subsidiary of Medtronic plc.) entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, under which we share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and
Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. We, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of
U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from
adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments, and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation. All costs
and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties.

All
of the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses, including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from Tyco International, became our tax liabilities. Although
we have agreed to share



certain
of these tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien, we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco International and Covidien default on their obligations to us,
we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for
all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and
required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's
tax liabilities.

Our,
Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. We are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. See additional information in "Income
Tax Matters" in "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings." Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and
related interest that we have assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740,

Income Taxes

, have
been reflected as liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across
multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of
whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards. These
estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of
the tax liabilities and related interest.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International has the right to administer, control, and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.
The timing, nature, and amount of any settlement agreed to by Tyco International may not be in our best interests. Moreover, the other parties to the Tax Sharing Agreement will be able to remove Tyco
International as the controlling party only under limited circumstances, including a change of control or bankruptcy of Tyco International, or by a majority vote of the parties. All other tax audits
will be administered, controlled, and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax.

Risks Relating to Our Swiss Jurisdiction of Incorporation

Legislative and other proposals in Switzerland, the U.S., and other jurisdictions could cause a
material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate.

Various U.S. and non-U.S. legislative proposals and other initiatives have been directed at multinational companies incorporated in
lower-tax jurisdictions. There has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's initiative to
prevent base erosion and profit shifting, which contemplates changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to the distribution of profits between affiliated entities in different tax
jurisdictions. Although any recommendations made by the OECD are not themselves changes in tax law, this guidance has resulted in unilateral action by several member countries and is also prompting
possible amendment of other countries' tax laws and regulations on a prospective and potentially a retroactive basis. If these proposals are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business,
they could, among other things, cause double taxation, increase audit risk, and materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate. We cannot



predict
the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives, and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us.

Legislation in the U.S. could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and
cash flows.

Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our
business by denying government contracts to U.S. companies that have moved to lower-tax jurisdictions.

We
expect the U.S. Congress to continue to consider implementation and/or expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that
have corporate locations abroad. We cannot predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under
any future legislative enactments, the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business, or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Therefore, we cannot
provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us. In addition, we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our
indirect sales to U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of our non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the
potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us.

As a Swiss corporation, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital
management involving the issuance of shares.

As a Swiss corporation, our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves
on our standalone unconsolidated Swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements. In addition, our articles of association allow us to create
authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors, but this authorization is limited to (i) authorized share capital up to 50% of the existing registered shares with such
authorization valid for a maximum of two years, which authorization period ended on March 6, 2015 and was not reapproved by our shareholders at our March 3, 2015 annual meeting of
shareholders, and (ii) conditional share capital of up to 50% of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions,
Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new
issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital. Swiss law also does
not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares, and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions, including the creation of
shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation, dividends, and/or voting. Moreover, under Swiss law, we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without
prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with
the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders, which would delay the timing to execute such actions. Such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital
management. While we do not believe that Swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us, we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise
where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors.



Swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of
our securities.

We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in
Switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland would recognize or
enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or
those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as they
are contrary to that nation's public policy.

Swiss
corporate law, which applies to us, differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the
manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification
available to directors and officers. Thus, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a
jurisdiction of the U.S.

Risks Relating to Our Shares

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely.

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors,
including:

•

our quarterly or annual earnings;

•

changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide;

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global and regional economic conditions and investors' concerns
about potential risks to future economic growth;

•

changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;

•

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; and

•

the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business.

We might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss
withholding tax.

In order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of Swiss withholding tax, we anticipate making distributions to
shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) or registered share capital. Various tax law and corporate law proposals in Switzerland, if
passed in the future, may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal
requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital, or that Swiss withholding rules would not be
changed in the future. In addition, over the long term, the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited. Our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our



shareholders
free from Swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction
on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc may limit the amount available for
any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.

Under Swiss corporate law, the registered share capital in our unconsolidated Swiss statutory financial statements is required to be
denominated in Swiss francs. Since distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in U.S. dollars, shareholder resolutions
with respect to such distributions must take into account the Swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital and consequently are required to be stated in Swiss francs. If the U.S. dollar
were to increase in value relative to the Swiss franc, the U.S. dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without Swiss withholding tax will decrease.

We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares.

The Swiss Code of Obligations regulates a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only
repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. The aggregate par value
of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, only if
our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased
shares are dedicated for cancellation. Additionally, various tax law and corporate law proposals in Switzerland, if passed in the future, may affect our ability to repurchase our shares. Our ability
to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to
repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to
vote at shareholder meetings.

Our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by Swiss law for Swiss companies like us that
issue registered shares (as opposed to bearer shares). This provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights, holders of our shares must be registered in our share register (Aktienbuch) as
shareholders with voting rights. Only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders' meetings, but all
shareholders will be entitled to dividends, distributions, preemptive
rights, advance subscription rights, and liquidation proceeds. The board of directors may, in its discretion, refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill
certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association. Additionally, various proposals in Switzerland for corporate law changes, if passed in the future, may require shareholder
registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks. Such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive
to investors.



Certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited
acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable.

Our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered "anti-takeover" provisions because they would make it harder
for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions, among others:

•

shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent, and

•

restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15% or more of our issued
voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors.

These
provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of our issued voting shares, which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or
delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price, or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders. Our articles of association also
contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from conditional capital (representing a maximum of 50% of the shares presently registered in the commercial register) and, if
approved by shareholders, may also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized capital (representing a maximum of 50% of the shares (or such lesser amount
as may be
approved by shareholders) registered in the commercial register), in each case, without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders' preemptive rights or advance subscription rights, for
the purpose of the defense of an actual, threatened, or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in relation to which the board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial advisor, has
not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. We note that Swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under Swiss law for withdrawing or
limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital. In addition, the NYSE, on which our shares are listed,
requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20% or more of the outstanding shares or voting power, with limited exceptions.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including product liability matters,
employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and
use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. In addition, we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the ordinary course of business, we are involved
as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third party's patent were to be determined against us, we might be required to make significant
royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to
be invalid or unenforceable, we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount.

As
previously reported, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represented the maximum amount payable
to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the State of Florida in accordance with guidelines set
forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we did not believe we had any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers contested our position and initiated a lawsuit
in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Trial began in March 2015 and culminated in the entry of final judgment on October 8, 2015, in favor of the sellers
and against us for $127 million plus costs. The judgment represents the $80 million contingent purchase price plus pre-judgment interest, which will continue to accrue until the judgment
is paid in full. We are proceeding with an appeal. In connection with this case, we recorded a reserve and pre-tax charges of $127 million in fiscal 2015. These charges are reflected in income
from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as the Com-Net case was associated with our former Wireless Systems business which was sold in fiscal 2009.

Management
believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these
proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position,
or cash flows. However, the proceedings discussed below in "Income Tax Matters" could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Income Tax Matters

In October 2012, the IRS issued special agreement Forms 870-AD, effectively settling its audit of all tax matters for the years
1997 through 2000, excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below. The disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. The IRS field examination
asserted that certain intercompany loans originated during the years 1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately $2.7 billion of
related interest deductions recognized during the period on Tyco International's U.S. income tax returns. In addition, if the IRS is ultimately successful in asserting its claim, it is likely to
disallow an additional $6.6 billion of interest deductions reflected on U.S. income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000. Tyco International contends that the intercompany financing
qualified as debt for U.S. income tax purposes and that the interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns were appropriate. The IRS and Tyco International were unable to resolve this matter
through the IRS appeals process. On June 20, 2013, Tyco International advised us that it had received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS for certain former U.S. subsidiaries of Tyco
International increasing taxable income by approximately $2.9 billion in connection with the audit of Tyco International's fiscal years 1997 through 2000. The Notices of Deficiency assert that
Tyco International



owes
additional taxes totaling $778 million, associated penalties of $154 million, and withholding taxes of $105 million. In addition, Tyco International received Final
Partnership Administrative Adjustments for certain U.S. partnerships owned by former U.S. subsidiaries with respect to which Tyco International estimates an additional tax deficiency of approximately
$30 million will be asserted. The amounts asserted by the IRS exclude any applicable deficiency interest, and do not reflect any impact to subsequent period tax liabilities in the event that
the IRS were to prevail on some or all of its assertions. We understand that Tyco International strongly disagrees with the IRS position and has filed petitions in the U.S. Tax Court contesting the
IRS's proposed adjustments. Tyco International has advised us that it believes there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question and that the IRS position with regard to this matter is
inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing U.S. Treasury regulations.

The
previously set U.S. Tax Court trial date of February 29, 2016 has been delayed at the request of the IRS, and trial is expected to commence during October 2016. The parties
remain engaged in discovery. We do not expect any payments to the IRS with respect to this matter until it is fully and finally resolved. In accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco
International, and Covidien would share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of any payments made in connection with this matter.

If
the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, our share of the assessed tax, deficiency interest, and applicable withholding taxes and penalties could have a material adverse impact on
our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We have reviewed the Notices of Deficiency, the relevant facts surrounding the intercompany debt transactions, relevant tax regulations,
and applicable case law, and we continue to believe that we are appropriately reserved for this matter.

discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends or distributions be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial
condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant. We may from time to time enter into financing agreements that contain
financial covenants and restrictions, some of which may limit our ability to pay dividends or to distribute capital reductions.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans,
estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those
factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Our
Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").

The
following discussion includes organic net sales growth and free cash flow which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, together with GAAP
financial measures, provide useful information to investors because they reflect the financial measures that management uses in evaluating the underlying results of our operations. See "Non-GAAP
Financial Measures" for more information about these non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including the measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the
measures.

Overview

We are a global technology leader. We design and manufacture connectivity and sensors solutions that are essential in today's
increasingly connected world. We help our customers solve the need for intelligent, efficient, and high-performing products and solutions.

During
fiscal 2015, we reorganized our management structure and segments to better align the organization around our strategy. We now operate through three reportable segments:
Transportation Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Communications Solutions. See Notes 1 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments.
Prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current segment reporting structure.

Fiscal
2015 highlights included the following:

•

Overall, our net sales increased 2.2% in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, due to increased net sales in the Transportation
Solutions and Communications Solutions segments, partially offset by sales declines in the Industrial Solutions segment.

•

On an organic basis, net sales increased 3.8% during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Our organic net sales by segment were as
follows:

•

Transportation Solutions

—Our net sales increased 4.1% on an
organic basis during fiscal 2015 due primarily to increases in the automotive end market.

•

Industrial Solutions

—Our organic net sales were flat in
fiscal 2015.

•

Communications Solutions

—Our organic net sales increased 8.4%
in fiscal 2015, due primarily to sales increases in the subsea communications end market, partially offset by declines in the data and devices end market.

•

During fiscal 2015, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $1.32 per issued share payable in four
quarterly installments of $0.33 beginning with the third fiscal quarter of 2015 and ending in the second fiscal quarter of 2016.

•

During fiscal 2015, we acquired Measurement Specialties and divested our BNS business.



Outlook

In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect net sales to be between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion. This reflects sales
decreases in all segments relative to the first quarter of
fiscal 2015. Additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 is as follows:

•

Transportation Solutions

—We expect our sales declines in the automotive
and commercial transportation end markets to be partially offset by sales growth in the sensors end market in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect global automotive production to decline 2% in
the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2015.

•

Industrial Solutions

—We expect our sales to decrease during the first
quarter of 2016 as a result of the slowdown in China, inventory reductions in the supply chain, and continued weakness in the oil and gas market.

•

Communications Solutions

—In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect
our sales growth in the subsea communications end market to be more than offset by our sales declines in the data and devices and appliances end markets resulting from continued weakness in China,
inventory reductions in the supply chain, and the exit of certain product lines.

We
expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.70 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This outlook reflects continued market weakness in China. Also, it reflects the
negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $167 million and $0.05 per share, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as
compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

For
fiscal 2016, which will be 53 weeks in length, we expect net sales to be between $12.0 billion and $12.8 billion, primarily reflecting sales increases in the
Transportation Solutions segment offset by sales declines in the Communications Solutions segment from fiscal 2015 levels. Additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for
fiscal 2016 is as follows:

•

Transportation Solutions

—During fiscal 2016, we expect our sales to
increase in the automotive end market while we expect global automotive production to be flat as compared to fiscal 2015. Also, we expect our sales growth in the sensors end market to be partially
offset by sales declines in the commercial transportation end market in fiscal 2016.

•

Industrial Solutions

—Within the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end
market, we expect our sales growth, primarily in the commercial aerospace market, to be offset by sales declines in the oil and gas market due to continued market weakness in fiscal 2016. We
anticipate that the negative impact of inventory adjustments in the supply chain will continue during the first half of fiscal 2016.

•

Communications Solutions

—In fiscal 2016, we expect our sales growth in the
subsea communications end market to be more than offset by our sales declines in the data and devices end market resulting from the exit of certain product lines and continued weakness in China.

We
expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.61 to $4.01 per share in fiscal 2016. This outlook includes approximately $200 million in net sales and $0.05 earnings per share
resulting from the additional week in fiscal 2016. Also, this outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately
$262 million and $0.10 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.

The
above outlook is based on foreign exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.

We
are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment, including the uncertain market conditions in China, and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve.
Additionally, we continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions. We are also



managing
our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. See further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital
Resources."

Acquisition

On October 9, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Measurement Specialties, a leading global designer and
manufacturer of sensors and sensor-based systems, for $86.00 in cash per share. The total value paid was approximately $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired, and included $225 million for
the repayment of Measurement Specialties' debt and accrued interest. This business has been reported as part of our Transportation Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. See additional
information regarding acquisitions in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Discontinued Operations

During fiscal 2015, we sold our BNS business for $3.0 billion in cash and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1,105 million on
the transaction.

The
BNS business met the discontinued operations criteria and has been reported as such in all periods presented on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to
discontinued operations, the BNS business was a component of the former Network Solutions segment.

See
Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Planned Divestiture

On November 7, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Circuit Protection Devices ("CPD") business for
$350 million in cash, subject to a final working capital adjustment. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 pending customary closing conditions and
regulatory approvals. The net assets of the CPD business were approximately $200 million at September 25, 2015. The CPD business is currently reported as part of the Data and Devices
business within our Communications Solutions segment.

Net
sales increased $260 million, or 2.2%, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The increase in net sales resulted from sales contributions from acquisitions of 5.9% and
organic sales growth of 3.8%, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 7.5% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies. Measurement Specialties contributed
net sales of $548 million during fiscal 2015.

On
an organic basis, net sales increased $460 million, or 3.8%, in fiscal 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of sales increases in the Transportation Solutions and
Communications Solutions segments. Price erosion adversely affected organic sales by $208 million in fiscal 2015.

Net
sales increased $583 million, or 5.1%, in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of organic growth of 4.9% and the positive
impact of foreign currency translation of 0.3% due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies.

On
an organic basis, net sales increased $557 million, or 4.9%, during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 as increased net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment and,
to a lesser degree, the Industrial Solutions segment were partially offset by sales decreases in the Communications Solutions segment. Price erosion adversely affected organic sales by
$194 million in fiscal 2014.

See
further discussion of organic net sales below under "Segment Results."

Net Sales by Geographic Region.

Our business operates in three geographic regions—the Americas, Asia–Pacific, and
EMEA—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the
U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. We sell our products into
approximately 150 countries, and approximately 52% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2015. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2015 by major
currencies invoiced was as follows:

Gross
margin increased $115 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, gross margin included charges of $36 million from the amortization of
acquisition-related fair value adjustments to acquired inventories and customer order backlog associated primarily with Measurement Specialties. Excluding these charges, gross margin increased in
fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of higher volume and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and price erosion.

In
fiscal 2014, gross margin increased $321 million as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from improved manufacturing productivity and, to a
lesser degree, higher volume, partially offset by price erosion.

Cost
of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices, and the price of many of our raw materials continues to fluctuate. In fiscal 2015, we purchased
approximately 160 million pounds of copper, 123,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.5 million troy ounces of silver. The following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to
copper, gold, and silver.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $30 million in
fiscal 2015 as compared
to fiscal 2014. The decrease resulted primarily from cost control measures and saving attributable to restructuring actions, partially offset by additional expenses associated with Measurement
Specialties.

In
fiscal 2014, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $94 million as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase resulted primarily from increased selling expenses to
support higher sales levels, partially offset by savings attributable to restructuring actions and a gain on the sale of real estate.

Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses.

Research, development, and engineering expenses increased $44 million in
fiscal 2015 as
compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of additional expenses related to acquisitions and growth initiatives, primarily in the Transportation Solutions segment.

Acquisition and Integration Costs.

In fiscal 2015, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $55 million, related
primarily to the
acquisitions of Measurement Specialties and the SEACON Group ("SEACON"). In fiscal 2014, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $31 million, primarily in connection with the
acquisition of SEACON. In connection with the acquisition of Deutsch, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $14 million during fiscal 2013.

Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.

We are committed to continuous productivity improvements and consistently evaluate
opportunities to simplify
our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness
in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth. During fiscal 2015, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount
reductions and product line closures, primarily impacting the Communications Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments. During fiscal 2014, we initiated a restructuring program associated primarily
with headcount reductions and manufacturing site and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment. During fiscal 2013, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount
reductions and manufacturing site closures impacting all segments.

In
connection with these initiatives, we recorded net restructuring charges of $93 million, $23 million, and $225 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013,
respectively. We expect to incur net restructuring charges of approximately $75 million during fiscal 2016, and we expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be
approximately $90 million in fiscal 2016. Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2015 are estimated to be approximately



$80 million
and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2017. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses.

During
fiscal 2015, we incurred net other charges of $59 million, primarily in connection with the divestiture of BNS.

See
Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Interest Expense.

The increase in interest expense of $9 million in fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014 was due to higher average
debt levels. The
decrease of $12 million in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 was due to a lower average cost of debt.

Other Income (Expense), Net.

In fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recorded net other income (expense) primarily pursuant to the
Tax Sharing Agreement
with Tyco International and Covidien. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement.

Net
other expense in fiscal 2015 included $84 million related to the effective settlement of undisputed tax matters for the years 2001 through 2007. Net other income in fiscal
2014 included $18 million of income related to our share of a settlement agreement entered into by Tyco International with a former subsidiary, CIT Group Inc., which arose from a
pre-separation claim for which we were entitled to 31% once resolved. Net other expense in fiscal 2013 included $231 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters
for the years 1997 through 2000. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the effective settlement of undisputed tax matters.

Income Taxes.

The tax provision for fiscal 2015 reflects an income tax benefit of $264 million related to the effective
settlement of all
undisputed tax matters for the years 2001 through 2010, partially offset by $216 million of income tax charges associated with the tax impacts of certain intercompany legal entity
restructurings made in connection with our integration of Measurement Specialties. Also, the tax provision for fiscal 2015 reflects an income tax charge of $29 million associated with the tax
impacts of certain intercompany dividends related to the restructuring and sale of BNS.

The
tax provision for fiscal 2014 reflects income tax benefits of $282 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with certain ADC tax
loss carryforwards, partially offset by an income tax charge related to adjustments to prior year income tax returns.

In
fiscal 2014, we acquired SEACON, and its U.S. operations were combined with our ADC U.S. federal consolidated tax group. In addition, the ADC U.S. tax group was combined with other
U.S. legal entities and assets. We reassessed the realization of the revised ADC U.S. tax group's tax loss and credit carryforwards. Based upon management's review of forecasted future taxable income
of the reorganized combined tax group, we believed it was more likely than not that a tax benefit would be



realized
on additional U.S. federal and state net operating losses. Accordingly, we reduced the valuation allowance and recorded a tax benefit of $282 million.

The
tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects an income tax benefit of $331 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000.
In addition, the tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects $23 million of net tax benefits consisting primarily of income tax benefits recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation
allowance associated with certain ADC tax loss carryforwards and income tax benefits recognized in connection with the lapse of statutes of
limitations for examinations of prior year income tax returns, partially offset by income tax expense related to adjustments to prior year income tax returns.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $3,237 million and $1,706 million at fiscal year end 2015 and 2014, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty
of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. During fiscal 2015, the valuation allowance increased due
primarily to tax losses of $1,381 million (tax effected) generated in connection with the write-down of investments in subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions where future utilization is
uncertain. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We
have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in the
future. No additional provision has been made for Swiss or non-Swiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences
related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded
that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 25, 2015, certain subsidiaries had approximately $19 billion of cumulative
undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and
research and development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such
subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in
subsidiaries.

Net
sales in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $261 million, or 4.3%, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of sales contributions from acquisitions
of 9.3% and organic sales growth of 4.1%, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 9.1%. Measurement Specialties contributed net sales of $548 million during
fiscal 2015. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows:

•

Automotive

—Our organic net sales increased 5.1% in fiscal 2015 with growth
of 8.2% in the Asia–Pacific region, 4.4% in the EMEA region, and 0.8% in the Americas region. Growth in the Asia–Pacific and EMEA regions and North America was driven primarily
by increased content per vehicle. This growth was partially offset by weakness in South America driven by lower production volumes in Brazil.

•

Commercial transportation

—Our organic net sales decreased 1.0% in fiscal
2015 due to lower demand in the agriculture market across all regions, partially offset by growth in the heavy truck market in developed countries.

•

Sensors

—Our organic net sales increased 1.5% in fiscal 2015 due to new
product launches in China and increased volume in Japan, partially offset by market weakness in Korea and Eastern Europe.

In
fiscal 2014, net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $605 million, or 11.0%, from fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of organic sales growth of 10.4% and the
positive impact of foreign currency translation of 0.6%. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows:

•

Automotive

—Our organic net sales increased 9.0% in fiscal 2014. The
increase was due primarily to growth of 11.6% in the Asia–Pacific region, 7.8% in the EMEA region, and 7.0% in the Americas region. In the Asia–Pacific region, growth was
driven by increased demand in China and, to a lesser degree, Japan, partially offset by declines in certain southeastern Asia–Pacific areas. In the EMEA region, growth resulted primarily
from increased demand for exports to other regions and, to a lesser degree, increased local demand. Growth in the Americas region was driven by strong consumer demand in North America, partially
offset by weaker economic conditions in South America.

•

Commercial transportation

—Our organic net sale increased 20.8% in fiscal
2014 due to stronger market conditions, strength in the North America truck market, and the acceleration of purchases related to emission standard changes in China and the EMEA region.

•

Sensors

—Our organic net sales increased 1.6% in fiscal 2014 due to growth
in the Americas and EMEA regions, partially offset by a decline in the Asia–Pacific region.

Net
sales in the Communications Solutions segment increased $122 million, or 4.7%, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of organic sales growth of 8.4%, partially
offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 3.7%. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows:

•

Data and devices

—Our organic net sales increased 150.5% in fiscal
2015 as a result of increased levels of project activity.

•

Appliances

—Our organic net sales increased 2.3% in fiscal 2015 with
increased demand in the EMEA region and a rebound in the U.S. market, partially offset by lower demand in the Asia–Pacific region.

follows:

•

Data and devices

—Our organic net sales decreased 5.5% in fiscal 2014 due

Our
ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital
markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these
other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of $500 million of senior floating rate notes due
in January 2016. We may use excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law, to purchase a portion of our common
shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares, or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines. The cost or availability of
future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions.

As
of September 25, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws,
substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE
Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax costs. We provide for tax liabilities on the Consolidated Financial
Statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global
manufacturing operations. As of September 25, 2015, we had approximately $5.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have
the ability to distribute to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, and TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to
approximately $1.7 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated
Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits
that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities decreased $185 million to $1,619 million in fiscal 2015 as compared
to $1,804 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease resulted primarily from the unfavorable effects of changes in working capital levels, partially offset by a decrease in net payments made in
relation to pre-separation tax matters.

Net
cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,804 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to $1,775 million in fiscal 2013. The increase resulted primarily from
higher income levels, partially



offset
by higher accounts receivable levels and net payments made in relation to pre-separation tax matters.

and postretirement benefit contributions in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $68 million, $89 million, and $95 million, respectively. We expect pension and
postretirement benefit contributions to be $75 million in fiscal 2016, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. There were no voluntary pension contributions in fiscal 2015, 2014,
and 2013.

The
amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $350 million, $259 million, and $299 million, respectively. In fiscal 2015
and 2013, these payments included $47 million and $67 million, respectively, for tax deficiencies related to pre-separation tax matters. Also during fiscal 2015 and 2013, we received net
reimbursements of $7 million and $39 million, respectively, from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation U.S. tax matters. During fiscal
2014, we made net payments of $179 million to Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to our indemnifications for pre-separations U.S. tax matters. See Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information related to pre-separation tax matters.

In
addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. Free cash flow was
$1,076 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to $1,477 million in fiscal 2014 and $1,244 million in fiscal 2013. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided
by continuing operating activities, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Capital expenditures were $600 million, $635 million, and $581 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013,
respectively. We expect fiscal 2016 capital spending levels to be approximately 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest
in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.

Proceeds
from the sale of property, plant, and equipment for fiscal 2014 included approximately $100 million related to the sale of real estate.

During
fiscal 2015, we acquired Measurement Specialties. The total value paid for the transaction was approximately $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired, and included
$225 million for the repayment of Measurement Specialties' debt and accrued interest. Also during fiscal 2015, we acquired three additional companies for $241 million in cash, net of
cash acquired. During fiscal 2014, we acquired five companies for $522 million in cash, net of cash acquired. See additional information in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

During
fiscal 2015, we received net cash proceeds of $3.0 billion related to the sale of our BNS business. See additional information in Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.



Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization

Total debt at fiscal year end 2015 and 2014 was $3,903 million and $3,858 million, respectively. See Note 11 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.

During
February 2015, TEGSA, our 100%-owned subsidiary, repaid, at maturity, $250 million of 1.60% senior notes due 2015.

In
February 2015, TEGSA issued €550 million aggregate principal amount of 1.100% senior notes due March 1, 2023. The notes are TEGSA's unsecured senior
obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.

TEGSA
has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in August 2013
primarily to extend the
maturity date from June 2016 to August 2018 and reduce borrowing costs. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at September 25, 2015 and September 26, 2014.

The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as
defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is
triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of September 25,
2015, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.

Periodically,
TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper
program are backed by the Credit Facility.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.

Payments
of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders were $502 million, $443 million, and $384 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013,
respectively. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding dividends and cash distributions on our common shares.

Future
dividends on our common shares or reductions of registered share capital for distribution to shareholders, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their
discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends or distributions be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial
condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant.

During
fiscal 2015, our board of directors authorized an increase of $3.0 billion in the share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately 18 million of our common
shares for $1,163 million, approximately 11 million of our common shares for $604 million, and approximately 20 million of our common shares for $829 million during
fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. At September 25, 2015, we had $2.7 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.

and penalties.

(4)

The
table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make
contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type,
including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $75 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2016,
before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

(5)

Other
long-term liabilities of $433 million are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items.

Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims,
product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as
value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings,
based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our
results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, the proceedings discussed below in "Income Tax Matters" could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for further information regarding legal proceedings.

As
previously reported, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represented the maximum amount payable
to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the State of Florida in accordance with guidelines set
forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we did not believe we had any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers contested our position and initiated a lawsuit
in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Trial began in March 2015 and culminated in the entry of final judgment on October 8, 2015, in favor of the sellers
and against us for $127 million plus costs. The judgment represents the $80 million contingent purchase price plus



pre-judgment
interest, which will continue to accrue until the judgment is paid in full. We are proceeding with an appeal. In connection with this case, we recorded a reserve and pre-tax charges of
$127 million in fiscal 2015. These charges are reflected in income from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as the Com-Net case was associated with our former
Wireless Systems business which was sold in fiscal 2009.

Income Tax Matters

In connection with the separation from Tyco International in 2007, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our,
Tyco International's, and Covidien's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations with respect to taxes for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. See Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and
indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. See "Income Tax Matters" in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income tax matters,
including the disputed issue related to the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and
financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2016 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of
nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks
involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities
and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At
September 25, 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds in the amount of $360 million.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results
of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies
are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following accounting policies are considered to be the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions
that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.



Revenue Recognition

Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with ASC 605,

Revenue Recognition

.
Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer.
This generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the
time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is
generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and also is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Contract
revenues for construction related projects, which are generated in the Communications Solutions segment, are recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method.
Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to
total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the
period in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they
first become determinable.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible
assets with a determinable life primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, as well as customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range
from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinable-lived intangible assets is performed on a periodic
basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation.

We
test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for
which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2015, we had seven reporting units, six of which contained goodwill. There are two
reporting units in each of the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, and three reporting units in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the composition of
one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill
impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure.

Goodwill
impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we
believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting-unit-specific factors
including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and
management's judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In
the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds
the implied



fair
value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized
in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in
a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Fair
value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The
income approach generally has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax
rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in
future periods.

We
completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and determined that no impairment existed.

Income Taxes

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments
affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and
financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and non-U.S.
pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the
forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in
the appropriate jurisdictions. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred
tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Any changes in a valuation
allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition will be reflected in the income tax provision.

Changes
in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we
conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for
issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and
the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. In addition, management reviews with tax counsel various issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of
recorded amounts. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the



impact
of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement
with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that
differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our defined benefit pension and
postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement
date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement
factoring in estimated future compensation levels. For the postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial
present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant
contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based
on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected
average remaining service lives of current participants.

Two
critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least
annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience.
Actual results may
differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows
for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2015, a 25 basis point
decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $136 million; a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension
obligations by $122 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan
assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have increased or decreased,
respectively, our fiscal 2015 pension expense by $11 million.

The
long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans' master trust is 10% equity and 90% fixed income. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period
based on the funded status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the "Pension Act Funded Status"), of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions. We expect to reach our target
allocation when the Pension Act Funded Status exceeds 105%. Based on the Pension Act Funded Status as of September 25, 2015, our target asset allocation is 45% equity and 55% fixed income.

Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.



Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic net sales growth and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for results in accordance
with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of these measures is that they exclude the financial impact of
items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using these non-GAAP measures in combination with the most directly comparable GAAP
measures in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts. The following provides additional information regarding these non-GAAP
measures.

Organic Net Sales Growth

Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our underlying results and trends in the business. It is also a significant component
in our incentive compensation plans. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth consists of the impact from foreign currency
exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures, if any. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management's control,
such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. Management uses
organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision
making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses
in evaluating operations. The tables presented in "Results of Operations" and "Segment Results" above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating
activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and free cash flow consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. We believe free cash flow provides
useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations.

Free
cash flow is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items, if any, minus net
capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. These items are subtracted because they represent
long-term commitments. Voluntary pension contributions are excluded because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net
payments related to pre-separation tax matters, are also considered by management in evaluating free cash flow. We believe investors also should consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow.

Free
cash flow subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the board of directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash
available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash
flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may
have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered in the calculation of free cash flow.



The
tables presented in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under GAAP.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain statements in this report are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. These statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include, among others, the
information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance
improvements, acquisitions, divestitures, the effects of competition, and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical
facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words "believe," "expect," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue," "may,"
"should," or the negative of these terms or similar expressions.

Forward-looking
statements involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. You should not
put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We do not have any intention or obligation to update forward-looking statements after we file this report except as required by law.

The
following and other risks, which are described in greater detail in "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors," as well as other risks described in this Annual Report, could cause
our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements:

•

conditions in the global or regional economies and global capital markets, and cyclical industry conditions;

•

conditions affecting demand for products in the industries we serve, particularly the automotive industry;

•

competition and pricing pressure;

•

market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations and product life cycles;

•

raw material availability, quality, and cost;

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

financial condition and consolidation of customers and vendors;

•

reliance on third-party suppliers;

•

risks associated with current and future acquisitions and divestitures;

•

global risks of business interruptions such as natural disasters and political, economic, and military instability;

•

risks associated with security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure;

•

risks related to compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations;

•

our ability to protect our intellectual property rights;

•

risks of litigation;

•

our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by our debt instruments;



•

risks relating to our separation on June 29, 2007 from Tyco International;

•

the possible effects on us of various U.S. and non-U.S. legislative proposals and other initiatives that, if adopted, could materially
increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate and negatively impact our U.S. government contracts business;

•

various risks associated with being a Swiss corporation;

•

the impact of fluctuations in the market price of our shares; and

•

the impact of certain provisions of our articles of association on unsolicited takeover proposals.

There
may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated
with interest rate and currency
movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements. We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing
derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks.

We
do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are
limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 credit rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty.

Foreign Currency Exposures

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts, foreign
currency forward contracts, and foreign currency swap contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and
profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our cross-currency swap
contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, or foreign currency swap contracts from the September 25, 2015 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by
$109 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our foreign currency forward or swap contracts from the September 26, 2014 market rates would have changed
the unrealized value of our contracts by $16 million. Such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying
transactions.

Interest Rate and Investment Exposures

We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To
manage the interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. We use forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into
interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt. We also utilize investment swaps to manage earnings exposure on certain
nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities.

Based
on our floating rate debt balances of approximately $800 million at September 25, 2015 and $950 million at September 26, 2014, an increase in the levels
of the U.S. dollar interest rates by 0.5%,
with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately $4 million and $5 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.



Commodity Exposures

Our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the effects of
fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges. We continually evaluate the commodity market with
respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts in order to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period. At
September 25, 2015, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, and copper, were in a net loss position of $33 million and had a notional value of
$260 million. At September 26, 2014, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, and copper, were in a net loss position of $21 million and had a
notional value of $307 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold, a troy ounce of silver, and a pound of copper, from the September 25, 2015 prices
would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $23 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold, a troy ounce of silver, and a pound of
copper, from the September 26, 2014 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $29 million.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 25, 2015. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 25, 2015.

Measurement Specialties Acquisition

We acquired Measurement Specialties on October 9, 2014. For additional information regarding the acquisition, see Note 5
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

SEC
guidance permits management to omit an assessment of an acquired business' internal control over financial reporting from management's assessment of internal control over financial
reporting for a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. We are in the process of integrating the Measurement Specialties operations within our internal control structure.
Accordingly, we have excluded Measurement Specialties from our annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2015.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 25, 2015.

As
discussed above, management has excluded Measurement Specialties from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting. Measurement Specialties represented 9% of total
assets and 4% of total net sales on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2015.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of
September 25, 2015, which is included in this Annual Report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the quarter ended September 25, 2015, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of TE Connectivity Ltd.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 25, 2015 and September 26,
2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 25, 2015. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 25, 2015 and
September 26, 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 25, 2015, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of TE Connectivity Ltd.:

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 25, 2015, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
As described in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of Measurement
Specialties, Inc. ("Measurement Specialties"), which was acquired on October 9, 2014 and whose financial statements constitute 9% of total assets and 4% of total net sales
of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 25, 2015. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at
Measurement Specialties. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2015, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.



We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2015, and our report dated November 10, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule.

The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of TE Connectivity Ltd. and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").

Description of the Business

TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") is a global
technology leader. We design and manufacture connectivity and sensors solutions that are essential in today's increasingly connected world. We help our customers solve the need for intelligent,
efficient, and high-performing products and solutions.

We
consist of three reportable segments:

•

Transportation Solutions.

The Transportation Solutions
segment is a leader in connectivity and sensor technologies. Our products, which must withstand harsh conditions, are used in the automotive, commercial transportation, and sensors markets.

•

Industrial Solutions.

The Industrial Solutions segment is
a leading supplier of products that connect and distribute power, data, and signals. Our products are used in the industrial equipment; aerospace, defense, oil, and gas; and energy markets.

•

Communications Solutions.

The Communications Solutions
segment is a top supplier of electronic components for the data and devices and appliances markets. We are also a leader in developing, manufacturing, installing, and maintaining some of the world's
most advanced subsea fiber optic communications systems.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in these
Consolidated Financial Statements include restructuring and other charges, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future
cash flows and discount rates associated with asset impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, estimated contract revenue and
related costs, legal contingencies, tax reserves and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension and postretirement employee
benefit expenses. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Fiscal Year

We have a 52 or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday of September. Fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013 were 52 weeks and
ended on September 25, 2015, September 26, 2014, and September 27, 2013, respectively. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period
will include 14 weeks with the next occurrence taking place in fiscal 2016.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

We consolidate entities in which we own or control more than 50% of the voting shares or otherwise have the ability to control through
similar rights. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included on the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of
acquisition or up to the date of disposal.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title
and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably
assured.

Contract
revenues for construction related projects, which are generated in the Communications Solutions segment, are recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method.
Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to
total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the
period in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they
first become determinable.

We
generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship
for a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We accept returned goods only when the customer
makes a verified claim and we have authorized the return. Generally, a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a
reduction of sales.

Additionally,
certain of our long-term contracts in the Communications Solutions segment have warranty obligations. Estimated warranty costs for each contract are determined based on the
contract terms and technology-specific considerations. These costs are included in total estimated contract costs and are accrued over the construction period of the respective contracts under
percentage-of-completion accounting.

We
provide certain distributors with an inventory allowance for returns or scrap equal to a percentage of qualified purchases. A reserve for estimated returns and scrap allowances is
established at the time of the sale, based on an agreed upon fixed percentage of sales to distributors, and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Other
allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is
recorded as a reduction of sales. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate the amounts of future allowances.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value using the first-in, first-out cost method, except for inventoried costs
incurred in the performance of long-term contracts primarily by the Communications Solutions segment.

Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net

Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to
expense when incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 10 to 20 years for land improvements, 5 to
40 years for buildings and improvements, and 1 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.

We
periodically evaluate, when events and circumstances warrant, the net realizable value of property, plant, and equipment and other long-lived assets, relying on a number of factors
including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the asset group are
evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying asset group. Impairment of the carrying value is recognized whenever anticipated
future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying value of the asset. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and
discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible
assets with a determinable life primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, as well as customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range
from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinable-lived intangible assets is performed on a periodic
basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation.

At
fiscal year end 2015, we had seven reporting units, six of which contained goodwill. There are two reporting units in each of the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions
segments, and three reporting units in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units
affected based on their relative fair values.

Goodwill
impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we
believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting-unit-specific factors
including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and
management's judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount. If the



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

carrying
amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In the step II
goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied
fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized
in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in
a business
combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Fair
value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The
income approach generally has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax
rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in
future periods.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in research, development, and engineering expenses on
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred, and building and overhead expenses. The amounts expensed in fiscal 2015, 2014, and
2013 were $540 million, $484 million, and $494 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740,

Income Taxes

. Deferred tax
liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected on the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss
carryforwards using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available
evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our
operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of
whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. In addition, management reviews with tax counsel various issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the
adequacy of recorded amounts. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such
tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may
change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate

resolution
may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest.

Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt, and derivative
financial instruments.

We
account for derivative financial instrument contracts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. For instruments not designated as hedges under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, the changes in
the instruments' fair value are recognized currently in earnings. For instruments designated as cash flow
hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which
the underlying hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of a cash flow hedge, including amounts excluded from the hedging relationship, are recognized currently in earnings. Changes in the
fair value of instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or liability hedged, with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability
being recognized currently in earnings.

We
determine the fair value of our financial instruments by using methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. Standard
market conventions are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, including derivatives.

The
cash flows related to derivative financial instruments are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Our
derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks. Concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated, however, by our use of financial institutions
worldwide, substantially all of which have long-term Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, we utilize only conventional derivative financial
instruments. We are exposed to potential losses if a counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of its agreement. With respect to counterparty net asset positions recognized at
September 25, 2015, we have assessed the likelihood of counterparty default as remote. We currently provide guarantees from a wholly-owned subsidiary to the counterparties to our commodity swap
derivatives and exchange cash collateral with the counterparties to our cross-currency swap contracts. The likelihood of performance on the guarantees has been assessed as remote. For all other
derivative financial instruments, we are not required to provide, nor do we require counterparties to provide, collateral or other security.

Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

, specifies a fair value hierarchy
based upon the observable inputs utilized in valuation of certain assets and liabilities. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable
inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. Fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:

•

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets and liabilities.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

•

Level 2.

Quoted prices in active markets for
similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

•

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are supported by
little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flows methodologies, and similar techniques
that use significant unobservable inputs.

Financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are generally valued using level 2 inputs.

Financial
instruments other than derivative instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. These instruments are recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at book value. For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, we believe book value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. See Note 11 for disclosure of the fair value of debt. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial
instruments:

•

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents are
valued at book value, which we consider to be equivalent to unadjusted quoted prices (level 1).

•

Accounts receivable.

Accounts receivable are valued
based on the net value expected to be realized. The net realizable value generally represents an observable contractual agreement (level 2).

•

Accounts payable.

Accounts payable are valued based on
the net value expected to be paid, generally supported by an observable contractual agreement (level 2).

•

Long-term debt.

The fair value of long-term debt,
including both current and non-current maturities, is derived from quoted market prices or other pricing determinations based on the results of market approach valuation models using observable market
data such as recently reported trades, bid and offer information, and benchmark securities (level 2).

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

The funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected
benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. For the postretirement benefit
plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already
rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of
participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected
average remaining service lives of current participants.

The
measurement of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on estimates and assumptions determined by our management. These valuations reflect the terms of the plans
and use participant-specific information such as compensation, age, and years of service, as well as certain assumptions, including estimates of discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of
compensation increases, interest crediting rates, and mortality rates.

Share-Based Compensation

We determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant. Share options are valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation
model; restricted share awards and performance awards are valued using our end-of-day share price on the date of grant. The fair value is expensed ratably over the expected service period, with an
allowance made for estimated forfeitures based on historical employee activity. Estimates regarding the attainment of performance criteria are
reviewed periodically; the cumulative impact of a change in estimate regarding the attainment of performance criteria is recorded in the period in which that change is made.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. is computed by dividing net income attributable to TE
Connectivity Ltd. by the basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. is computed by dividing net income
attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation arrangements.

Currency Translation

For our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using fiscal year end
exchange rates. Sales and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) within equity.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, which are included in earnings, were immaterial in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013.

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring activities involve employee-related termination costs, facility exit costs, and asset impairments resulting from
reductions-in-force, migration of facilities or product lines from higher-cost to lower-cost countries, or consolidation of facilities within countries. We recognize termination costs based on
requirements established by severance policy, government law, or previous actions. Facility exit costs generally reflect the cost to terminate a facility lease before the end of its term (measured at
fair value at the time we cease using the facility) or costs that will continue to
be incurred under the facility lease without future economic benefit to us. Restructuring activities often result in the disposal



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

or
abandonment of assets that require an acceleration of depreciation or impairment reflecting the excess of the assets' carrying values over fair value.

The
recognition of restructuring costs require that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing, and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
To the extent our actual results differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimated liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring costs or the
reduction of liabilities already recognized. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure these balances are properly stated and the utilization of the
reserves are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.

Acquisitions

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires, among other things, that most
assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values, or as required by ASC 805,

Business Combinations

. The excess of the purchase price over the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We may engage independent third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

Contingent Liabilities

We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount
of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists, we record the low end of the range. The likelihood
of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information
available. In addition, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine
whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of that loss can be made. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a loss is at least reasonably possible,
disclosure is provided.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with
Customers

. This guidance supersedes ASC 605,

Revenue Recognition

, and introduces a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue
recognition model. ASC 606 also enhances disclosures related to revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASC 606 by one year. ASC 606 will be effective for us in
the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach at adoption. We are continuing to assess the impact of adopting ASC 606, but do not
expect adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

2013, respectively.

Fiscal 2015 Actions

During fiscal 2015, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions and product line closures, primarily
impacting the Communications Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments. In connection with this program, during fiscal 2015, we recorded net restructuring charges of $92 million. We expect to
complete all restructuring actions commenced in fiscal 2015 by the end of fiscal 2016 and to incur total charges of approximately $98 million.

Fiscal 2014 Actions

During fiscal 2014, we initiated a restructuring program associated primarily with headcount reductions and manufacturing site and
product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment. In connection with this program, we recorded net restructuring charges of $19 million in fiscal 2014. We do not expect to incur
significant additional expense related to restructuring programs commenced in fiscal 2014.

Fiscal 2013 Actions

During fiscal 2013, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures impacting
all segments. In connection with this program, during fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recorded net restructuring charges of $1 million, $9 million, and $240 million, respectively.
We do not expect to incur significant additional expense related to restructuring programs commenced in fiscal 2013.

Pre-Fiscal 2013 Actions

During fiscal 2012, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce headcount across all segments. Also, during fiscal 2012, we
initiated a restructuring program in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments associated with the acquisition of Deutsch Group SAS. During fiscal 2014 and 2013, we recorded net
restructuring credits of $5 million and $15 million, respectively, related to pre-fiscal 2013 actions. We do not expect to incur any additional charges related to pre-fiscal 2013
actions.

Other Charges (Credits), Net

During fiscal 2015, in connection with the sale our Broadband Network Solutions ("BNS") business, we incurred costs of
$61 million, consisting primarily of $36 million of legal and professional fees and $18 million of charges associated with the exit of a facility. These amounts are not directly
related to the business sold, and accordingly have been recorded in continuing operations. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the divestiture of BNS.

4. Discontinued Operations

During fiscal 2015, we sold our BNS business for $3.0 billion in cash and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1,105 million on the transaction. In the U.S., income taxes
associated with the gain on the sale of assets were largely offset by income tax benefits realized on the sale of several subsidiaries. In certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the sale was exempt from
income taxes.

Pre-tax
income from discontinued operations for fiscal 2015 included pre-tax charges of $127 million recorded in connection with the Com-Net case related to our former Wireless
Systems business which was sold in fiscal 2009. See Note 13 for additional information regarding the Com-Net case.

to reclassification to discontinued operations, the BNS and Wireless Systems businesses were included in the former Network Solutions and Wireless Systems segments, respectively.

5. Acquisitions

Measurement Specialties, Inc.

On October 9, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Measurement Specialties, Inc. ("Measurement
Specialties"), a leading global designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensor-based systems, for $86.00 in cash per share. The total value paid was approximately $1.7 billion, net of cash
acquired, and included $225 million for the repayment of Measurement Specialties' debt and accrued interest. Measurement Specialties offers a broad portfolio of technologies including pressure,
vibration,

force,
temperature, humidity, ultrasonics, position, and fluid sensors, for a wide range of applications and industries. This business has been reported as part of our Transportation Solutions segment
from the date of acquisition.

During
the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we finalized the valuation of identifiable intangible assets, fixed assets, and pre-acquisition contingencies.

The

The
fair values assigned to intangible assets were determined through the use of the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty and the multi-period excess earnings methods.
Both valuation methods rely on management judgment, including expected future cash flows resulting from existing customer relationships, customer attrition rates, contributory effects of other assets
utilized in the business, peer group cost of capital and royalty rates, and other factors. The valuation of tangible assets was derived using a combination of the income, market, and cost approaches.
Significant judgments used in valuing tangible assets include estimated reproduction or replacement cost, useful lives of assets, estimated selling prices, costs to complete, and reasonable profit.
Useful lives for intangible assets were determined based upon the remaining useful economic lives of the intangible assets that are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows.

The
acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.

Goodwill
of $1,064 million was recognized in the transaction, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. This goodwill is attributable primarily to cost savings and other synergies related to operational efficiencies including the consolidation of manufacturing, marketing, and
general and administrative functions. The goodwill has been allocated to the Transportation Solutions segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. However, prior to its merger with us, Measurement
Specialties completed certain acquisitions that resulted in goodwill with an estimated value of $23 million that is deductible primarily for U.S. tax purposes, which we will deduct through
2030.

During
fiscal 2015, Measurement Specialties contributed net sales of $548 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Due to the commingled nature of our operations, it
is not practicable to separately identify operating income of Measurement Specialties on a stand-alone basis.

The
following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects our consolidated results of operations had the Measurement Specialties acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal
2014:

Specialties as a result of the change in control of Measurement Specialties, $11 million of charges related to the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventories, $7 million of
charges related to acquired customer order backlog, $6 million of income tax expense based on the estimated impact of combining Measurement Specialties into our global tax position, and
$1 million of charges related to the amortization of the fair

value
of acquired intangible assets. In addition, pro forma results for fiscal 2015 were adjusted to include $3 million of interest expense based on pro forma changes in our capital structure.

Pro
forma results for fiscal 2014 were adjusted to include $20 million of charges related to the amortization of the fair value of acquired intangible assets, $19 million
of income tax expense based on the estimated impact of combining Measurement Specialties into our global tax position, $14 million of interest expense based on pro forma changes in our capital
structure, $11 million of charges related to the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventories, $7 million of charges related to acquired customer order backlog, and
$2 million in depreciation expense.

Pro
forma results do not include any anticipated synergies or other anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily
indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the Measurement Specialties acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2014.

Other Acquisitions

During fiscal 2015, we acquired three additional companies for $241 million in cash, net of cash acquired. During fiscal 2014,
we acquired five companies, including the SEACON Group ("SEACON"), a leading provider of underwater connector technology and systems, for $522 million in cash, net of cash acquired.

The
senior floating rate notes due 2016 bear interest at a rate of three-month London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.20% per year.

(2)

Senior
notes are presented at face amount and, if applicable, are net of unamortized discount and the effects of interest rate swaps designated as fair
value hedges.

In
February 2015, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued €550 million aggregate principal amount of 1.100% senior notes
due March 1, 2023. The notes are TEGSA's unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any
subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.

TEGSA
has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in August 2013
primarily to extend the maturity date from June 2016 to August 2018 and reduce borrowing costs. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at September 25, 2015 and September 26,
2014.

Borrowings
under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured,
long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Deutsche Bank AG New York branch's base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus


/


of 1%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

11. Debt (Continued)

1%,
plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 7.5 to 25.0 basis points
based upon the amount of the lenders' commitments under the Credit Facility and the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA.

The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as
defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is
triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants.

Periodically,
TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper
program are backed by the Credit Facility.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.

fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $4,115 million and $4,125 million at fiscal year end 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Tax Sharing Agreement

Effective June 29, 2007, we became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International plc
("Tyco International"). On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of our shares, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders
(the "separation"). On January 26, 2015, Covidien was acquired and now operates as a subsidiary of Medtronic plc.

Upon
separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, under which we share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a
sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. We, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from
adjustments made by tax

12. Guarantees (Continued)

authorities
to our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with
respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities
settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the
parties.

All
of the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses, including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from Tyco International, became our tax liabilities. Although
we have agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien, we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco International and Covidien default on
their obligations to us, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for
all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and
required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's
tax liabilities.

Indemnification

Our indemnification created under the Tax Sharing Agreement qualifies as a guarantee of a third party entity's debt under ASC 460,

Guarantees

. In the event that we are required, due to bankruptcy or other business interruption on the part of Tyco International or Covidien, to pay
more than the contractually determined 31%, we retain the right to seek payment from the effected entity. At September 25, 2015 and September 26, 2014, we had a liability representing
the indemnifications made to Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement of $17 million and $21 million, respectively. See additional information in
Note 13.

Other Matters

In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including
unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing
facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At
September 25, 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds in the amount of $360 million.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results
of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

12. Guarantees (Continued)

We
generally record estimated product warranty costs when contract revenues are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method for construction related contracts; other warranty
reserves are not significant. The estimation is based primarily on historical experience and actual warranty claims. Amounts accrued for warranty claims at fiscal year end 2015 and 2014 were
$35 million and $29 million, respectively.

13. Commitments and Contingencies

General Matters

We have facility, land, vehicle, and equipment leases that expire at various dates. Rental expense under these leases was
$141 million, $130 million, and $133 million for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. At fiscal year end 2015, the minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable
lease obligations were as follows:

Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims,
product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as
value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and
applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash
flows. However, the proceedings discussed below in "Income Tax Matters" could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

As
previously reported, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represented the maximum amount payable
to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the State of Florida in accordance with guidelines set
forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we did not believe we had any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers contested our position and initiated a lawsuit
in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Trial began in March 2015 and culminated in the entry of final judgment on October 8, 2015, in favor of the sellers
and against us for $127 million plus costs. The judgment represents the $80 million contingent purchase price plus pre-judgment interest, which will continue to accrue until the judgment
is paid in full. We are

proceeding
with an appeal. In connection with this case, we recorded a reserve and pre-tax charges of $127 million in fiscal 2015. These charges are reflected in income from discontinued
operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as the Com-Net case was associated with our former Wireless Systems business which was sold in fiscal 2009.

Income Tax Matters

Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and
Covidien. See Note 12 for additional information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement.

Prior
to separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined income tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our subsidiaries' income tax returns are examined
periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco
International, as the U.S. income tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax
adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income
Taxes,

which relate specifically to our entities have been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Tyco
International's and Covidien's tax obligations. Estimates of these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
October 2012, the IRS issued special agreement Forms 870-AD, effectively settling its audit of all tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000, excluding one issue that remains
in dispute as described below. As a result of these developments, in fiscal 2013, we recognized an income tax benefit of $331 million, representing a reduction in tax reserves for the matters
that were effectively settled, and other expense of $231 million, representing a reduction of associated indemnification receivables, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco
International and Covidien.

The
disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. The IRS field examination asserted that certain intercompany loans originated during the years
1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately $2.7 billion of related interest deductions recognized during the period on Tyco
International's U.S. income tax returns. In addition, if the IRS is ultimately successful in asserting its claim, it is likely to disallow an additional $6.6 billion of interest deductions
reflected on U.S. income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000. Tyco International contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt for U.S. income tax purposes and that the
interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns were appropriate. The IRS and Tyco International were unable to resolve this matter through the IRS appeals process. On June 20, 2013,
Tyco International advised us that it had received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS for certain former U.S. subsidiaries of Tyco International increasing taxable income by approximately
$2.9 billion in connection with the audit of Tyco International's fiscal years 1997 through 2000. The Notices of Deficiency assert that Tyco International owes additional taxes totaling
$778 million, associated penalties of $154 million, and withholding taxes of $105 million. In addition, Tyco International received Final Partnership Administrative Adjustments
for certain U.S. partnerships owned by former U.S. subsidiaries with respect to which Tyco International estimates an additional tax deficiency of approximately $30 million will be asserted.
The amounts asserted by the



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

IRS
exclude any applicable deficiency interest, and do not reflect any impact to subsequent period tax liabilities in the event that the IRS were to prevail on some or all of its assertions. We
understand that Tyco International strongly disagrees with the IRS position and has filed petitions in the U.S. Tax Court contesting the IRS's proposed adjustments. Tyco International has advised us
that it believes there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question and that the IRS position with regard to this matter is inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing U.S.
Treasury regulations.

The
previously set U.S. Tax Court trial date of February 29, 2016 has been delayed at the request of the IRS, and trial is expected to commence during October 2016. The parties
remain engaged in discovery. We do not expect any payments to the IRS with respect to this matter until it is fully and finally resolved. In accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco
International, and Covidien would share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of any payments made in connection with this matter.

If
the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, our share of the assessed tax, deficiency interest, and applicable withholding taxes and penalties could have a material adverse impact on
our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We have reviewed the Notices of Deficiency, the relevant facts surrounding the intercompany debt transactions, relevant tax regulations,
and applicable case law, and we continue to believe that we are appropriately reserved for this matter.

During
fiscal 2015, the IRS issued general agreement Forms 870, effectively settling its audits of tax matters for the years 2001 through 2007, excluding the disputed issue
discussed above. As a result of these developments, we recognized an income tax benefit of $201 million, representing a reduction in tax reserves for the matters that were effectively settled,
and other expense of $84 million, representing a reduction of associated indemnification receivables, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien.

Also
during fiscal 2015, the IRS issued general agreement Forms 870, effectively settling its audits of tax matters for the years 2008 through 2010, excluding the disputed issue
discussed above. As of result of these developments, we recognized an income tax benefit of $63 million, representing a reduction in tax reserves for the matters that were effectively settled.

We
made net payments of $40 million, $179 million, and $28 million related to pre-separation U.S. tax matters during fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

At
September 25, 2015 and September 26, 2014, we have reflected $17 million and $51 million, respectively, of income tax liabilities related to the audits of
Tyco International's and our income tax returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within the next twelve months.

We
believe that the amounts recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and
could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

Environmental Matters

We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The
ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative
cleanup methods. As of fiscal year end 2015, we concluded that it was probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of $16 million to $38 million, and that the best estimate
within this range was $19 million. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or
cash flows.

14. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements

We use derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, investment, and commodity risks.

The
effects of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were immaterial for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013.

Foreign Exchange Risks and Hedges of Net Investment

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts, foreign
currency forward contracts, and foreign currency swap contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and
profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. We expect that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) associated with the cash flow hedge-designated instruments addressing foreign exchange risks will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the next twelve months.

During
fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of €1,000 million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency
exchange risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we will make quarterly interest payments in euros at 3.50%
per annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.33% per annum. Upon the maturities of these contracts in fiscal 2022, we will pay the principal amount of the loans in
euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.

We
hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany non-derivative financial instruments denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of
these hedges was $3,880 million and $2,893 million at September 25, 2015 and September 26, 2014, respectively. Foreign exchange gains of $353 million and
$156 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, were recorded as currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), offsetting foreign exchange losses
attributable to the translation of the net investment. Foreign exchange gains and losses recorded as currency translation in fiscal 2013 were immaterial. See Note 20 for additional information.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

Interest Rate and Investment Risk Management

We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To
manage the interest rate
exposure, we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. We use forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate swaps to
manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt. We also utilize investment swaps to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred
compensation liabilities.

Commodity Hedges

As part of managing the exposure to certain commodity price fluctuations, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow
hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in prices of commodities used in production.

At
September 25, 2015 and September 26, 2014, our commodity hedges had notional values of $260 million and $307 million, respectively. We expect that
significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with the commodity hedges will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the
next twelve months.

Fair Value Measurements

Financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, which consist of derivative instruments and marketable securities,
were immaterial at September 25, 2015 and September 26, 2014.

15. Retirement Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

We have a number of contributory and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of our U.S. and non-U.S.
employees, designed in accordance with local customs and practice.

In
fiscal 2015, unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for U.S. defined benefit pension plans are due primarily to a change in the
mortality assumption and lower than expected asset performance. Unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in
fiscal 2015 are principally the result of lower discount rates as compared to fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2014, unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are
primarily the result of changes in mortality assumptions and decreasing discount rates for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and attributable primarily to lower discount rates for non-U.S. defined
benefit pension plans as compared to fiscal 2013. Amortization of prior service credit is included in other in the above table summarizing the components of net periodic pension benefit cost.

The
estimated amortization of actuarial losses from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic pension benefit cost for U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension
plans in fiscal 2016 is expected to be $40 million and $36 million, respectively. The estimated amortization of prior service credit from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
into net periodic pension benefit cost for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2016 is expected to be $6 million.

In
determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations.

The
investment strategy for the U.S. pension plans is governed by our investment committee; investment strategies for non-U.S. pension plans are governed locally. Our investment strategy
for our pension plans is to manage the plans on a going concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the
purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. Projected returns are based primarily on pro forma asset

allocation,
expected long-term returns, and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management.

The
long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans' master trust is 10% equity and 90% fixed income. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period
based on the funded status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the "Pension Act Funded Status"), of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions. We expect to reach our target
allocation when the Pension Act Funded Status exceeds 105%. Based on the Pension Act Funded Status as of September 25, 2015, our target asset allocation is 45% equity and 55% fixed income.

Our
common shares are not a direct investment of our pension funds; however, the pension funds may indirectly include our shares. The aggregate amount of our common shares would not be
considered material relative to the total pension fund assets.

Our
funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which we operate as well as to make discretionary voluntary contributions
from time to time. We expect to make the minimum required contributions of $5 million and $68 million to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively, in fiscal 2016. We may also
make voluntary contributions at our discretion.

Benefit
payments, which reflect future expected service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

15. Retirement Plans (Continued)

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

We maintain several defined contribution retirement plans, the most significant of which is located in the U.S. These plans include
401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants'
compensation and was $60 million, $61 million, and $61 million for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans

We maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A
record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds correspond to a
number of funds in our 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Total deferred compensation liabilities were $118 million and
$108 million at fiscal year end 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 14 for additional information regarding our risk management strategy related to deferred compensation liabilities.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension and 401(k) benefits, we also provide certain health care coverage continuation for qualifying retirees
from the date of retirement to age 65. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was $40 million and $44 million at fiscal year end 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the
underfunded status of the postretirement benefit plans was included primarily in long-term pension and postretirement liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Activity during fiscal 2015, 2014,
and 2013 was not significant.

16. Income Taxes

Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. We have provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the
countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation.

The
tax provision for fiscal 2015 reflects an income tax benefit of $264 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the years 2001 through 2010,
partially offset by $216 million of income tax charges associated with the tax impacts of certain intercompany legal entity restructurings made in connection with our integration of Measurement
Specialties. Also, the tax provision for fiscal 2015 reflects an income tax charge of $29 million associated with the tax impacts of certain intercompany dividends related to the restructuring
and sale of BNS.

The
tax provision for fiscal 2014 reflects income tax benefits of $282 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with certain tax
loss carryforwards relating to ADC Telecommunications, Inc. ("ADC"), partially offset by an income tax charge related to adjustments to prior year income tax returns.

In
fiscal 2014, we acquired SEACON, and its U.S. operations were combined with our ADC U.S. federal consolidated tax group. In addition, the ADC U.S. tax group was combined with other
U.S. legal entities and assets. We reassessed the realization of the revised ADC U.S. tax group's tax loss and credit carryforwards. Based upon management's review of forecasted future taxable income
of the reorganized combined tax group, we believed it was more likely than not that a tax benefit would be realized on additional U.S. federal and state net operating losses. Accordingly, we reduced
the valuation allowance and recorded a tax benefit of $282 million.

The
tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects an income tax benefit of $331 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000.
In addition, the tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects $23 million of net tax benefits consisting primarily of income tax benefits recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation
allowance associated with certain ADC tax loss carryforwards and income tax benefits recognized in connection with the lapse of statutes of

During
fiscal 2015, tax loss and credit carryforwards increased due primarily to tax losses of $1,381 million (tax effected) generated in connection with the write-down of
investments in subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was increased by a corresponding amount due to the uncertainty of the future realization of these tax losses.

At
fiscal year end 2015, we had approximately $1,363 million of U.S. federal and $125 million of U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected) which will
expire in future years through 2035. In addition, at fiscal year end 2015, we had approximately $194 million of U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, of which $63 million have no
expiration and $131 million will expire in future years through 2035, and $40 million of U.S. state tax credits carryforwards which will expire in future years through 2030. Also, at
fiscal year end 2015, we had were $20 million of U.S federal capital loss carryforwards (tax effected) which will expire in future years through 2020.

At
fiscal year end 2015, we had approximately $3,068 million of net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected) in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, of which $3,005 million
have no expiration and $63 million will expire in future years through 2035. Also, at fiscal year end 2015, there were $1 million



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

16. Income Taxes (Continued)

of
non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards which have no expiration. In addition, we had approximately $45 million of non-U.S. capital loss carryforwards (tax effected), of which $38 million
have no expiration and $7 million will expire in future years through 2020.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $3,237 million and $1,706 million at fiscal year end 2015 and 2014, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty
of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable
income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At fiscal year end 2015, approximately $151 million of the
valuation allowance relates to share-based compensation and will be recorded to equity if certain net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are utilized.

We
have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in the
future. No additional provision has been made for Swiss or non-Swiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences
related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded
that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 25, 2015, certain subsidiaries had approximately $19 billion of cumulative
undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and
research and development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such
subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in
subsidiaries. As of September 25, 2015, we had approximately $5.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability
to distribute to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be
permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to approximately $1.7 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest
these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund
our operations, including investing and financing activities.

Uncertain Tax Position Provisions of ASC 740

As of September 25, 2015, we had total unrecognized income tax benefits of $1,368 million. If recognized in future years,
$1,291 million of these currently unrecognized income tax benefits would impact the income tax provision and effective tax rate. As of September 26, 2014, we had total unrecognized
income tax benefits of $1,595 million. If recognized in future years, $1,450 million of these unrecognized income tax benefits would impact the income tax provision and effective tax
rate. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized income tax benefits:

We
record accrued interest as well as penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes. As of September 25, 2015, we had recorded
$1,076 million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, of which $1,073 million was recorded in income taxes and the
remainder was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities. As of September 26, 2014, the balance of accrued interest and penalties was $1,136 million, of which
$1,115 million was recorded in income taxes and the remainder was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities. During fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recognized expense of
$7 million, expense of $99 million, and benefits of $247 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We
file income tax returns on a unitary, consolidated, or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions, which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to
4 years. Various state and local income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal.

Our
non-U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns in the countries in which they have operations. Generally, these countries have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to
10 years. Various non-U.S. subsidiary income tax returns are currently in the process of examination by taxing authorities.

In
most jurisdictions, taxing authorities retain the ability to review prior tax years and to adjust any net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from these years that are
utilized in a subsequent period.

Although
it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that up to approximately $60 million of unrecognized income tax benefits,
excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months. See Note 13 for additional information regarding the status of IRS
examinations.

We
are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
September 25, 2015.

17. Other Income (Expense), Net

In fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recorded net other expense of $55 million, net other income of $63 million, and net other expense of $183 million, respectively,
primarily pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. See Note 12 for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement. The net other expense in fiscal
2015 included $84 million related to the effective settlement of undisputed tax matters for the years 2001 through 2007. The net other income in fiscal 2014 included $18 million of
income related to our share of a settlement agreement entered into by Tyco International with a former subsidiary, CIT Group Inc., which arose from a pre-separation claim
for which we were entitled to 31% once resolved. The net other expense in fiscal 2013 included $231 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the years 1997
through 2000. See Note 13 for additional information regarding the effective settlement of undisputed tax matters.

There

instruments' underlying exercise prices were greater than the average market prices of our common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive.

19. Equity

Common Shares

We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of
association, and our Swiss organizational regulations. Accordingly, the par value of our common shares is stated in Swiss francs ("CHF"). We continue to use the U.S. dollar, however, as our reporting
currency on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Subject
to certain conditions specified in our articles of association, we are authorized to increase our conditional share capital by issuing new shares in aggregate not exceeding 50%
of our authorized shares.

Common Shares Held in Treasury

At September 25, 2015, approximately 20 million common shares were held in treasury, of which 6 million were owned
by one of our subsidiaries. At September 26, 2014, approximately 11 million common shares were held in treasury, of which 9 million were owned by one of our subsidiaries. Shares

In
fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, our shareholders approved the cancellation of five million, ten million, and ten million shares, respectively, purchased under our share repurchase
program. These capital reductions by cancellation of shares were subject to a notice period and filing with the commercial register in Switzerland.

Contributed Surplus

Contributed surplus established for Swiss tax and statutory purposes ("Swiss Contributed Surplus"), subject to certain conditions, is a
freely distributable reserve. Distributions to shareholders from Swiss Contributed Surplus are free from withholding tax. As of September 25, 2015 and September 26, 2014, Swiss
Contributed Surplus was CHF 8,392 million and CHF 8,907 million, respectively (equivalent to $7,505 million and $8,036 million, respectively).

Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders

Under Swiss law, subject to certain conditions, distributions to shareholders made in the form of a reduction of registered share
capital or from reserves from capital contributions (equivalent to Swiss Contributed Surplus) are exempt from Swiss withholding tax. See "Contributed Surplus" for additional information regarding our
ability to make distributions free from withholding tax from contributed surplus. Distributions or dividends on our shares must be approved by our shareholders.

21. Share Plans

Equity awards (primarily restricted share awards, performance share awards, and share options) granted by us are administered by the management development and compensation committee of
our board of directors, which consists exclusively of independent directors. Our plans, of which the TE Connectivity Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, is the primary
plan, provide for the award of annual performance bonuses and long-term performance awards, including share options, restricted and performance units, deferred stock units, and other share-based
awards

67 million shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the plans. A total of 19 million shares remained available for issuance under our plans as
of September 25, 2015.

We
recognized a related tax benefit associated with our share-based compensation arrangements of $29 million, $24 million, and $22 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and
2013, respectively.

Restricted Share Awards

Restricted share awards, which are generally in the form of restricted share units, are granted subject to certain restrictions.
Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. All restrictions on an award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies retirement requirements, a
portion of the award may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights, but do receive dividend equivalents. For grants that
vest through passage of time, the fair value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on
the closing value of our shares on the grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest in increments over a period of four years as determined by the management development and compensation
committee.

As
of September 25, 2015, there was $87 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted share awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.6 years.

Performance Share Awards

Performance share awards, which are generally in the form of performance share units, are granted with pay-out subject to vesting
requirements and certain performance conditions that are determined at the time of grant. Based on our performance, the pay-out of performance share units can range from 0% to 200% of the number of
units originally granted. The grant-date fair value of performance share awards is expensed over the period of performance once achievement of the performance criteria is deemed probable. Recipients
of performance share units have no voting rights but do receive dividend equivalents. Performance share awards generally vest after a period of three years as determined by the management development
and compensation committee.

a weighted-average period of 1.0 years.

Share Options

Share options are granted to purchase our common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of the common
shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee
satisfies retirement requirements, a portion of the award may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Options generally vest and become exercisable in equal annual
installments over a period of four years and expire ten years after the date of grant.

The
total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $107 million, $136 million, and $69 million, respectively. We received cash
related to the exercise of options of $103 million, $156 million, and $214 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The related excess cash tax benefit classified as
a financing cash inflow on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013 was not material.

As
of September 25, 2015, there was $39 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share options granted under our share option plans. The cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.

Share-Based Compensation Assumptions

The grant-date fair value of each share option grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Use of a
valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. We employ our historical share volatility when calculating the grant-date fair value of our share
option grants using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Currently, we do not have exchange-traded options of sufficient duration to employ an implied volatility assumption in the
calculation and therefore rely solely on the historical volatility calculation. For fiscal 2013, we calculated the grant-date fair value of our share option awards utilizing the historical share
volatility of a composite of our peers and implied volatility derived from exchange-traded options on that same composite of peers since we did not have historical share price information for a period
of time equal to our expected option life assumption. The change in methodology did not have a significant impact on share-based compensation expense during fiscal 2015 or 2014. The average expected
life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
issues with a remaining term that approximated the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share was based on our expected dividend rate. The recognized
share-based compensation expense was net of estimated forfeitures, which are based on voluntary termination behavior as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

22. Segment and Geographic Data

During fiscal 2015, we reorganized our management structure and segments to better align the organization around our strategy. Our businesses in the former Consumer Solutions segment and
our continuing businesses in the former Network Solutions segment have been moved into the newly created Communications Solutions segment. (See Note 4 for information regarding discontinued
operations.) In addition, the former Data Communications and Consumer Devices businesses have been combined to form the Data and Devices business. We now operate through three reportable segments:
Transportation Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Communications Solutions. See Note 1 for a description of the segments in which we operate. We aggregate our operating segments into
reportable segments based upon similar economic characteristics and business groupings of products, services, and customers.

Segment
performance is evaluated based on net sales and operating income. Generally, we consider all expenses to be of an operating nature and, accordingly, allocate them to each
reportable segment. Costs specific to a segment are charged to the segment. Corporate expenses, such as headquarters administrative costs, are allocated to the segments based on segment operating
income. Intersegment sales were not material and were recorded at selling prices that approximate market prices. Corporate assets are allocated to the segments based on segment assets.

The
following segment information reflects our current segment reporting structure. Prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current segment reporting structure.
