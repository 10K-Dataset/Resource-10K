ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

General

TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") is a global technology and
manufacturing leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. Our connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, have enabled advancements in
transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home.

We
became an independent, publicly traded company in 2007; however, through our predecessor companies, we trace our foundations in the connectivity business back to 1941. We are
organized under the laws of Switzerland. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations.

We
have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday of September. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period includes
14 weeks. Fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 ended on September 28, 2018, September 29, 2017, and September 30, 2016, respectively. Fiscal 2018 and 2017 were
52 weeks in length. Fiscal 2016 was a 53-week year.

Segments

We operate through three reportable segments: Transportation Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Communications Solutions. We believe our
segments serve a combined market of approximately $190 billion. In fiscal 2018, our Subsea Communications business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria. As a result, we
reclassified amounts previously reported to reflect this business as a discontinued operation in all periods presented. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, this business was included
in our Communications Solutions segment.

Our
net sales by segment as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows:

Customers

As an industry leader, we have established close working relationships with many of our customers. These relationships allow us to better
anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we can identify
and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products.

Our
approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and
engineering support. We believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate, our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when
addressing the needs of our global customers.

We
manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships
with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to
individual end markets, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results
and distinguishes us from our competitors.

No
single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017, or 2016.



Sales and Distribution

We maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate. Our net sales by geographic region

Net
sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale.

We
sell our products into approximately 140 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers. In fiscal 2018, our direct sales represented approximately 80% of total
net sales. We also sell our products indirectly via third-party distributors.

We
maintain distribution centers around the world. Products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the
customer. In some instances, however, products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. Our global coverage positions us near our customers' locations and allows us to
assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road, rail, sea, and air.
We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile.

Seasonality and Backlog

We experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically the strongest quarters of
our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets.

Certain
of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales into the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production
may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales into the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases.

Customer
orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business and market conditions. Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be
cancelled prior to shipment of goods. Backlog by reportable segment was as follows:

Competition

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational
corporations to local manufacturers. Competition is generally based on breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, and service. Our markets have generally been growing
but with downward pressure on prices.

Raw Materials

We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for
molding; precious metals such as gold and silver for plating; and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used for cable and
component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of these
materials are driven by global supply and demand.

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing
technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary
rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify
licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.

We
own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents
and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent
protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.

While
we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by
any single patent or group of related patents.

Management Team and Employees

We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology
leadership. Our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to
maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry.

Our
strong employee base, along with their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company's success. We continue to emphasize employee development and
training, and we embrace diversity and inclusion.

We
have employees located throughout the world. As of fiscal year end 2018, we employed approximately 80,000 people worldwide, of whom 30,000 were in the EMEA region, 25,000 were in the
Asia–Pacific region, and 25,000 were in the Americas region. Of our total employees, approximately 51,000 were employed in manufacturing.



Government Regulation and Supervision

The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. A small portion of our
products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance
organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our
ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.

Environmental

Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials in products, and chemical usage. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and
the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards; staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues; periodic
compliance auditing; training; and other measures. We also have a program for compliance with the European Union ("EU") Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment Directives, the China Restriction of Hazardous Substances law, the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH") Regulation, and similar laws.

Compliance
with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. For example, laws regarding product content and
chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and
products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our
experience, available information, and applicable laws, as of fiscal year end 2018, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range
of $15 million to $42 million, and we accrued $17 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We do not anticipate any material capital
expenditures during fiscal 2019 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.

Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. These risks are not
the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also
impair our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Risks Relating to the Macroeconomic Environment and Our Global Presence

Conditions in global or regional economies, capital and money markets, and banking systems, and cyclical
industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally, including the cost
and availability of consumer and business credit, end demand from consumer and industrial markets, and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign
debt and significant bank failures or defaults. Any of these economic factors could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow, and ability to obtain financing. As
a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full. Further, our vendors
may experience similar problems, which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels. If regional or global economic conditions deteriorate, our results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Also, deterioration in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of
impairment charges for our goodwill or other long-lived assets. Impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and financial position.

Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars; however, a significant portion of our business is
conducted outside the U.S. Changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We
are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue. Approximately 60% of our net sales for fiscal 2018 were invoiced in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar, and we expect non-U.S. dollar revenue to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales. We have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure.
Therefore, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the euro or Asian currencies, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and income
will decrease.

We
manage certain cash, intercompany, and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by
the counterparty to these contracts, our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful.

We could suffer significant business interruptions.

Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers, and the supply chains that support their operations, may be vulnerable to interruption
by natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, or floods; or other disasters such as fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war, disease, or failures of management information or other
systems due to internal or external causes. If a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events, our business, results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.



We could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans' investment portfolios
or a reduction in returns on plan assets.

Concerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with concerns about credit, inflation, or deflation, have caused and could continue
to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities, including fixed income and equity securities, which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans' investment
portfolios. In addition, the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved. A decrease in the value of our pension plans' investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could
have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient
funding.

The global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted, which has reduced the availability of investment
capital and credit. Downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital. As a result, we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and
grow our business. Our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures. The extent of any
impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity, the cost of
financing, and other general economic and business conditions.

We are subject to global risks of political, economic, and military instability.

Our workforce; manufacturing, research, administrative, and sales facilities; markets; customers; and suppliers are located throughout the
world. As a result, we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including:

•

changes in global trade policies, including sanctions, tariffs, trade barriers, and trade disputes;

•

regulations related to customs and import/export matters;

•

variations in lengths of payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable;

•

tax law and regulatory changes in the U.S. and EU among other jurisdictions, including tax law and regulatory changes that may be effected as a
result of tax policy recommendations from quasi-governmental organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD"), examinations by taxing authorities, variations
in tax laws from country to country, changes to the terms of income tax treaties, and difficulties in the tax-efficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions;

•

employment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which we
currently operate;

•

difficulties protecting intellectual property;

•

instability in economic or political conditions, including sovereign debt levels, Eurozone uncertainty, inflation, recession, actual or
anticipated military or political conflicts, and any impact as a result of the expected exit of the United Kingdom from the EU; and

•

the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements.

We
have sizeable operations in China, including 16 manufacturing sites. In addition, approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 were made to customers in China. Economic
conditions in China have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain. In addition, the legal and regulatory system in China is still developing and subject to change. Accordingly, our
operations and transactions with



customers
in China could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions, changes to the regulatory environment, or interpretation of Chinese law.

In
addition, any downgrade by rating agencies of long-term U.S. sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets
and economic conditions, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and liquidity.

Changes in U.S. federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to U.S. persons treated as owning 10%
or more of our shares.

Although we are a Swiss corporation, recent U.S. tax law changes have expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules and cause
certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be treated as Controlled Foreign Corporations ("CFCs") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. person that is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as owning, directly, indirectly, or constructively, 10% or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income
earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as CFCs, whether or not we make any distributions to such U.S. shareholder. A U.S. person that owns 10% or more of our shares should consult a tax adviser
regarding the potential implications to it of these changes in U.S. federal income tax law. The risk of U.S. federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries
that now are treated as CFCs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us, and others from investing in us, which could impact the demand for, and value of, our shares.

Risks Relating to the Industry in Which We Operate

We are dependent on the automotive and other industries.

We are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products, and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced
demand in these markets. Periodic downturns in our customers' industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Approximately
44% of our net sales for fiscal 2018 were to customers in the automotive industry. The automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant
price pressure on their suppliers. Additionally, the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit
conditions. As a supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global
or regional economic and credit conditions and changes in the operations, products, business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automotive manufacturers, as
well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers.

During
fiscal 2018, approximately 14% of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market, 9% of our net sales were to customers in the commercial transportation
market, and 8% of our net sales were to customers in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market. Demand for industrial equipment is dependent upon economic conditions, including customer
investment in factory automation, intelligent buildings, and process control systems, as well as market conditions in the medical, rail transportation, solar and lighting, and other major industrial
markets we serve. The commercial transportation industry can experience variability in demand depending on the economic environment and market conditions in the heavy truck, construction, agriculture,
and recreational vehicle markets. The aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand, depending on worldwide economic and political conditions. Demand in the oil and
gas market is impacted by oil price volatility.



We encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry.

We operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components, and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the
future. Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price, quality, and performance of our products; the level of customer service; the development of new technology;
our ability to participate in emerging markets; and customers' expectations relating to socially responsible operations. The competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges
in size from large, diversified manufacturers to small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years, and
our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price, and in some instances may enjoy lower
production costs for certain products. We cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new
competitors. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows.

We are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future
revenue.

Substantially all markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences, which are rapid
in certain end markets. Our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design, develop, introduce, and sell new and innovative products; to modify existing products; and to
customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change. There are numerous risks inherent in these processes, including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of
technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands.

Like other suppliers to the electronics industry, we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices.

We have historically experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, continuing pressure to lower our prices. In recent years, we have
experienced price erosion averaging from 1% to 2% each year. To maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to
reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate.

Many of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become more
concentrated in recent years, including the automotive, data and devices, and aerospace and defense industries. Consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us. In addition,
as our customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase. Our materials
suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends may adversely affect the margins on our products, particularly for commodity components.

The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short.

The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle. As a result, the resources devoted to product
sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering expenses
and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not



able
to recover, and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Risks Relating to Our Operations

Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.

We are a large buyer of resins, chemicals, additives, and metals, including copper, gold, silver, aluminum, brass, steel, and zinc. Many of
these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, the price of many of these raw materials,
including gold and copper, continues to fluctuate. If we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases
for these raw materials, it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials. To the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price
increases to our customers, our margins may decline, materially affecting our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In addition, we use financial instruments to hedge the
volatility of certain commodities prices. The success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials. We could experience unanticipated
hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate.

In
accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin,
tantalum, tungsten, or gold ("conflict minerals" or "3TG") mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo ("DRC") and adjoining countries (together with the DRC, the "Covered Countries") in their
products. These requirements could affect the sourcing, pricing, and availability of 3TG used in the manufacture of certain of our products. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers
who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3TG from the Covered Countries, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain non-conflict 3TG in sufficient quantities or at
competitive prices. Further, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins and
chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures.

We may use components and products manufactured by third parties.

We may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture
certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if
there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. If these third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have
difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged.

Our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain management and executive
management employees.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our management and executive management employees and hire new
management and executive management employees to replace, succeed, or add to members of our management team. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace.
Competition for management talent is intense, and any difficulties we may have to retain or hire members of mangagement to achieve our objectives may have an adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows.



Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our
operations, compromise confidential information, and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation.

Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations; compromise information
belonging to us, our employees, customers, and suppliers; and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the normal course of business, we rely on information
technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and
activities. Additionally, we
collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information and customer and employee data, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that
is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and
systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats, our information
technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer
viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties
under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these
types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, to date none of these threats have had a material impact on our business or operations.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the
ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens. Our outstanding notes' indentures
contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability to consolidate, merge, and sell assets.

Although
none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our continued ability to meet the Credit Facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our
control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility or indentures. Upon the
occurrence of certain defaults under our Credit Facility and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our
lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our Credit Facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have
sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration of any
debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder.

The
indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access
to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a
change of control triggering event.



The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely.

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including:

•

our quarterly or annual earnings;

•

quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide or changes thereto;

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global and regional economic conditions and investors' concerns about
potential risks to future economic growth;

•

changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;

•

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;

•

tax legislative and regulatory actions and proposals in Switzerland, the U.S., and other jurisdictions;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; and

•

the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business.

Risks Relating to Strategic Transactions

Future acquisitions may not be successful.

We regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses, product lines, or technologies which have the potential to strengthen
our market position or enhance our existing product offerings. We cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future. We
also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business,
our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity.

If we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash, the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks, public
offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other
leverage measures. We cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to make an acquisition partially or
wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares.

Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures. Any divestitures may
result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial position. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel; the diversion of
management's attention from other business concerns; the disruption of our business; and the potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these
or any other significant risks encountered.



Risks Relating to Intellectual Property, Litigation, and Regulations

Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our
products and technology.

The electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry, companies
have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity
of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the importance of the technology, product, patent, trademark,
or trade secret in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

In the normal course of business, we are, from time to time, a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of
intellectual property rights, anti-competitive behavior, product liability, breach of contract, and employment-related claims. In certain circumstances,
patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant
expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

If any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable
trade regulations, our business may suffer.

Our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the
U.S. and the EU. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other
markets are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We may also be subject to third-party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe these
antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements,
whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could
limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash
flows.

We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom's
Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom's Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies
and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We
operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs
and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts
committed by our employees or agents. Violations



of
these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, government
enforcement actions, and reputational risk.

We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various
countries where we operate and where our products are sold. These laws and regulations govern, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment;

•

investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites;

•

greenhouse gas emissions;

•

product hazardous material content; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

We
may not have been, or we may not always be, in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally
charged, or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance requirements.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal, and remediation of hazardous substances
or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigation, removal, and remediation costs under certain federal and state laws
is retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of,
or exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notifications from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, other environmental agencies, and third parties that conditions at a number of
currently and formerly-owned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and require that we
reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites. We also have independently investigated various sites
and determined that further investigation and/or remediation is necessary.

While
we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future
environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect
our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury, property damage, and/or cleanup in the future based
on our past, present, or future business activities.

Our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, and
recycling.

The EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and
other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These
laws include but are not limited to the EU



Restriction
of Hazardous Substances, End of Life Vehicle, and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives; the EU REACH Regulation; and the China law on Management Methods for Controlling
Pollution by Electronic Information Products. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for
modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. These laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other
materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These laws could make the manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible, could limit our ability to sell our
products in certain jurisdictions, and could result in liability for product recalls, penalties, or other claims.

Risks Relating to Our Swiss Jurisdiction of Incorporation

As a Swiss corporation, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management
involving the issuance of shares.

As a Swiss corporation, our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our
standalone unconsolidated Swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements. In addition, our articles of association allow us to create authorized
share capital that can be issued by the board of directors, but this authorization is limited to (i) authorized share capital up to 50% of the existing registered shares with such authorization
valid for a maximum of two years, which authorization period ends on March 14, 2020, approved by our shareholders at our March 14, 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders and
(ii) conditional share capital of up to 50% of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants
preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new
issuances of shares from conditional share capital. Swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares, and reserves for approval by
shareholders many types of corporate actions, including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation, dividends, and/or voting. Moreover, under Swiss law, we generally
may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of
our registered shares. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders, which
would delay the timing to execute such actions. Such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management. While we do not believe that Swiss law
requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us, we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided
substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors.

We might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding
tax.

In order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of Swiss withholding tax, we anticipate making distributions to shareholders
through a reduction of contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes). Various tax law and corporate law proposals in Switzerland, if passed in the future, may affect our
ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to
shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital, or that Swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future. In addition, over the
long term, the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited. Our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free



from
Swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to
do so could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc may limit the amount available for any
future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.

Under Swiss law, the registered share capital in our unconsolidated Swiss statutory financial statements is required to be denominated in Swiss
francs. Although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in U.S. dollars, shareholder resolutions with respect to
such distributions must take into account the Swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital. If the U.S. dollar were to increase in value
relative to the Swiss franc, the U.S. dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without Swiss withholding tax will decrease.

We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares.

The Swiss Code of Obligations regulates a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only
repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. The aggregate par value
of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, only if
our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased
shares are dedicated for cancellation. Additionally, various tax law and corporate law proposals in Switzerland, if passed in the future, may affect our ability to repurchase our shares. Our ability
to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to
repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at
shareholder meetings.

Our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by Swiss law for Swiss companies like us that issue
registered shares (as opposed to bearer shares). This provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights, holders of our shares must be registered in our share register (Aktienbuch) as
shareholders with voting rights. Only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders' meetings, but all
shareholders will be entitled to dividends, distributions, preemptive rights, advance subscription rights, and liquidation proceeds. The board of directors may, in its discretion, refuse to register
shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements in our articles of association. Additionally, various proposals in Switzerland for corporate law
changes, if passed in the future, may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks. Such a
registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors.



Certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition
proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable.

Our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered "anti-takeover" provisions because they would make it harder for a third
party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions, among others:

•

shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent, and

•

restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15% or more of our issued voting
shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors.

These
provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of our issued voting shares, which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition
proposal or delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price, or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders. Our articles of association
also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital (in either case, representing a maximum of 50% of the shares presently registered
in the commercial register and in case of issuances from authorized capital, until March 14, 2020 unless re-authorized by shareholders for a subsequent two-year period) without shareholder
approval and without regard for shareholders' preemptive rights or advance subscription rights, for the purpose of the defense of an actual, threatened, or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in
relation to which the board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial advisor, has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. We note that Swiss courts have not addressed
whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under Swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription
rights with respect to conditional share capital. In addition, the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), on which our shares are listed, requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20%
or more of the outstanding shares or voting power, with limited exceptions.

Legislative and regulatory actions and proposals in Switzerland, the U.S., and other jurisdictions could
cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate.

Various legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lower-tax jurisdictions. There has
been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives, such as:

•

the OECD's initiative to develop agreed-upon best practices to prevent base erosion and profit shifting, which contemplate changes to numerous
long-standing tax principles related to the distribution of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions,

•

corporate tax reform in Switzerland, which is proposed in response to OECD and EU concerns,

•

EU and other country efforts to adopt certain OECD proposals and modified OECD proposals (including the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, state aid
cases, and various transparency proposals), and

•

tax policy in the U.S., such as federal tax reform and revisions to the Model Income Tax Treaty.

If
these proposals are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business, they could, among other things, cause double taxation, increase audit risk, and materially increase our
worldwide corporate effective tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives, and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will
not apply to us.



Legislation in the U.S. could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business
by denying government contracts to U.S. companies that have moved to lower-tax jurisdictions.

We
expect the U.S. Congress to continue to consider implementation and/or expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that
have corporate locations abroad. We cannot predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under
any future legislative enactments, the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business, or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Therefore, we cannot
provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us. In addition, we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our
indirect sales to U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of our non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the
potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us.

Swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our
securities.

As we are organized under the laws of Switzerland, it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in
Switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland would recognize or
enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or
those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as they
are contrary to Switzerland's public policy.

Swiss
law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the manner in which directors must
disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers.
Thus, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.



ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our principal executive office is located in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. As of fiscal year end 2018, we owned approximately 20 million
square feet and leased approximately 9 million square feet of manufacturing, warehousing, and office space. We believe our facilities are suitable for the conduct of our business and adequate
for our current needs.

We
manufacture our products in approximately 25 countries worldwide. Our manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of our manufacturing processes, including our primary processes of
stamping, plating, molding, extrusion, beaming, and assembly. We consider the productive capacity of our manufacturing facilities sufficient. As of fiscal year end 2018, our principal centers of
manufacturing output by segment and geographic region were as follows:

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including product liability matters, employment
disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real
estate tax, and transfer tax. In addition, we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the normal
course of business, we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third party's patent were to be determined against us, we might
be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products. If a patent owned by or
licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable, we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which
could be significant in amount.

Management
believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these
proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material
effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, one of our manufacturing sites in China was found to have failed to complete the environmental impact assessment inspection for certain of its
production lines and assets within the mandatory timeframe as defined within applicable environmental regulation. At the request of the Shanghai Xuhui Environmental Protection Bureau, we are taking
remedial action to cure the deficiencies, and we expect to pay an administrative penalty in the amount of 700,000 Chinese renminbi (approximately $0.1 million using an exchange rate of $0.15
per renminbi). We do not anticipate that any monetary sanctions or remedial actions we take will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated
Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and
beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or
contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Our
Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").

The
following discussion includes organic net sales growth which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" for additional information regarding this measure.

Overview

We are a global technology and manufacturing leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. For more than
75 years, our connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, have enabled advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data
communications, and the home.

Fiscal
2018 highlights included the following:

•

Our fiscal 2018 net sales increased 14.8% over fiscal 2017 levels due to growth in all segments. On an organic basis, our net sales increased
9.2% in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.

•

Our net sales by segment were as follows:

•

Transportation Solutions

—Our net sales increased 17.8% as a result of
increased sales in all end markets. Also, our net sales in the automotive end market benefited from sales contributions from a recent acquisition.

•

Industrial Solutions

—Our net sales increased 10.0% due to increased
sales in the industrial equipment end market and, to a lesser degree, the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas and the energy end markets.

•

Communications Solutions

—Our net sales increased 12.4% due to sales
increases in the appliances and the data and devices end markets.

•

During fiscal 2018, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $1.76 per share, payable in four equal quarterly
installments of $0.44 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.

•

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2,301 million in fiscal 2018.

Outlook

In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect our net sales to be between $3.33 billion and $3.43 billion as compared to
$3.34 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, with sales increases in the Industrial Solutions and Communications Solutions segments. Additional information regarding expectations for our
reportable segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2018 is as follows:

•

Transportation Solutions

—We expect our net sales increase in the sensors end market
to be offset by sales declines in the automotive end market. Our net sales in the automotive end market are



expected
to benefit from content gains; however, this growth will be more than offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We expect global automotive production to decline
approximately 2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

•

Industrial Solutions

—We expect our net sales growth to be driven primarily by
increased sales in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas and the industrial equipment end markets.

•

Communications Solutions

—We expect net sales growth primarily as a result of
increased sales in the data and devices end market.

In
the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.09 to $1.13 per share. This outlook reflects the negative impact of
foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $75 million and $0.04 per share, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the same
period of fiscal 2018.

We
expect our net sales to be between $13.9 billion and $14.3 billion in fiscal 2019 as compared to $14.0 billion in fiscal 2018, with moderate growth in all
segments. Additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 is as follows:

•

Transportation Solutions

—We expect our net sales increases in the sensors end
market to be largely offset by sales declines in the commercial transportation end market. Fiscal 2019 global automotive production is expected to be consistent with fiscal 2018 levels.

•

Industrial Solutions

—We expect our net sales to increase in the industrial
equipment end market due primarily to continued growth in medical applications and a recent acquisition.

•

Communications Solutions

—We expect net sales growth due primarily to sales
increases in the data and devices end market.

We
expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.40 per share in fiscal 2019. This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange
rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $400 million and $0.16 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.

The
above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.

We
are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. We continue to closely manage our costs in line with
economic conditions. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. See further
discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

Acquisitions

During fiscal 2018, we acquired two businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $153 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions
were reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.

We
acquired two businesses during fiscal 2017 for a combined cash purchase price of $250 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions were reported as part of our
Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments from the date of acquisition.

In
fiscal 2016, we acquired four businesses, including the Creganna Medical group ("Creganna"), for a combined cash purchase price of $1.3 billion, net of cash acquired. The
acquisitions were reported as part of our Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments from the date of acquisition.



See
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.

Discontinued Operations

On September 16, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Subsea Communications ("SubCom") business for
$325 million, subject to a final working capital adjustment. The SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been reported as such in all periods
presented on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment.

See
Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Divestiture

During fiscal 2016, we sold our Circuit Protection Devices ("CPD") business for net cash proceeds of $333 million. We recognized a
pre-tax gain of $144 million on the transaction. The CPD business was reported as part of the Data and Devices business within our Communications Solutions segment.

Net
sales increased $1,803 million, or 14.8%, in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales resulted from organic net sales growth of 9.2%, the positive
impact of foreign currency translation of 3.6% due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, and sales contributions from acquisitions of 2.0%. Organic net sales were adversely affected by
price erosion of $180 million in fiscal 2018.



Net sales increased $833 million, or 7.3%, in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net sales resulted from organic net sales growth of
6.1% and net sales contributions from acquisitions and a divestiture of 1.9%, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 0.7% due to the weakening of certain foreign
currencies. Organic net sales were adversely affected by price erosion of $218 million in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $227 million in net
sales. The impact of the additional week was estimated using an average weekly sales figure for the last month of the fiscal year.

See
further discussion of net sales below under "Segment Results."

Net Sales by Geographic Region.

Our business operates in three geographic regions—EMEA, Asia–Pacific, and the
Americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies,
will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. We sell our
products into approximately 140 countries, and approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2018. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2018 by
major currencies invoiced was as follows:

Fiscal
2016 included an additional week which contributed $86 million in gross margin.

In
fiscal 2018, gross margin increased $562 million as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of higher volume and the positive impact of foreign currency translation,
partially offset by price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 33.9% in fiscal 2018 from 34.3% in fiscal 2017. Gross margin increased $356 million in fiscal 2017 as
compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to higher volume and lower material costs, partially offset by price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 34.3% in fiscal 2017 from
33.7% in fiscal 2016.

Cost
of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices which continue to fluctuate for many of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. In
fiscal 2018, we purchased approximately 195 million pounds of copper, 139,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.8 million troy ounces of silver. The following table presents the average prices
incurred related to copper, gold, and silver.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

In fiscal 2018, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased
$51 million as compared
to fiscal 2017 due primarily to increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels and incremental expenses attributable to recently acquired businesses,



partially
offset by lower incentive compensation costs and a gain on the sale of certain assets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $147 million in fiscal 2017 as compared
to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation costs, increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels, and increased costs associated with long-term expense
reduction initiatives.

Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses.

In fiscal 2018, research, development, and engineering expenses increased
$69 million as
compared to fiscal 2017 due to costs related to growth initiatives, primarily in the Transportation Solutions segment.

Restructuring and Other Charges (Credits), Net.

We are committed to continuous productivity improvements, and we evaluate
opportunities to simplify
our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness
in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.

During
fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and
Transportation Solutions segments. During fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting
all segments. During fiscal 2016, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment.

In
connection with these initiatives, we recorded net restructuring charges of $140 million, $146 million, and $121 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016,
respectively. Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $125 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2020. Cost
savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. During fiscal 2019, we expect net restructuring charges to be similar to fiscal 2018 levels and
we expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $140 million.

During
fiscal 2016, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $144 million on the sale of our CPD business.

See
Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges (credits).

Other Income (Expense), Net.

In fiscal 2016, we recorded net other expense primarily pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with
Tyco
International plc ("Tyco International") and Covidien plc ("Covidien"). See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding net other income
(expense).

Income Taxes.

See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding items impacting income tax
expense (benefit) and
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 and information regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"). We do not expect a significant change in our effective tax rate on future
results of operations as a result of the Act.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $2,191 million and $3,627 million at fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information regarding the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

As
of fiscal year end 2018, certain subsidiaries had approximately $23 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our
global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding undistributed earnings.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes.

On September 16, 2018, we entered into a definitive
agreement to sell our
SubCom business. The net sales of the business were $702 million, $928 million, $886 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In fiscal 2018, net sales and operating
income were negatively impacted by production delays on a program. In fiscal 2017, net sales increased as a result of higher project activity and operating income was positively impacted by lower
material costs and improved manufacturing productivity as compared to fiscal 2016.



In connection with the sale of the SubCom business, in fiscal 2018, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $19 million, which is included in income
(loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to write the carrying value of the business down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. We expect to incur a
pre-tax loss on sale of approximately $90 million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses and certain guarantee liabilities, which will be presented in
income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In November 2018, we completed the sale of the SubCom business for $325 million. The proceeds received
are subject to a final working capital adjustment.

During
fiscal 2016, we settled a lawsuit with the former shareholders of Com-Net, which we acquired in fiscal 2001, and recorded pre-tax credits of $30 million representing a
release of excess reserves. This amount was reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as the Com-Net case was associated with our former
Wireless Systems business which was sold in fiscal 2009. Also during fiscal 2016, we recognized an additional pre-tax gain of $29 million on the fiscal 2015 divestiture of our Broadband Network
Solutions ("BNS") business, related primarily to pension and net working capital adjustments.

See
Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

In
fiscal 2018, net sales in the Communications Solutions segment increased $203 million, or 12.4%, as compared to fiscal 2017 due to organic net sales growth of 10.5% and the
positive impact of foreign currency translation of 1.9%. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows:

•

Data and devices

—Our organic net sales increased 9.5% in fiscal 2018 as a result of
growth in all regions, primarily attributable to growth in high speed connectivity in data center applications.

•

Appliances

—Our organic net sales increased 12.0% in fiscal 2018 as a result of
growth in all regions and market share gains.

Net
sales in the Communications Solutions segment increased $5 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Organic net sales growth of 5.7% was largely offset by sales
declines resulting from a divestiture of 4.3% and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 1.1%. Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $32 million in net
sales. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows:

•

Data and devices

—Our organic net sales increased 2.3% in fiscal 2017 primarily as a
result of increased sales to cloud infrastructure customers, partially offset by sales declines resulting from weakness in the wireless market.

•

Appliances

—Our organic net sales increased 10.8% in fiscal 2017 due primarily to
growth in the Asia–Pacific region as a result of increased market demand and share gains.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by
our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing
arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the
foreseeable future, including the payment of $325 million of 2.375% senior notes and $250 million of 2.35% senior notes due in fiscal 2019. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion
of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt.
The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions.

As
of fiscal year end 2018, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws,
substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE
Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense. We provide for tax liabilities on the Consolidated Financial
Statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global
manufacturing operations. As of fiscal year end 2018, we had approximately $11.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the
ability to distribute to TEGSA and TE Connectivity Ltd. but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to $0.9 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the
Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and
intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.



Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $28 million to $2,301 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to
$2,273 million in fiscal 2017. The increase resulted primarily from higher pre-tax income levels, substantially offset by the impact of higher working capital to support increased business
levels and increased incentive compensation payments.

Net
cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $340 million to $2,273 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to $1,933 million in fiscal 2016. The
increase resulted primarily from higher pre-tax income levels, an increase in accrued and other current liabilities related primarily to incentive
compensation, and a decrease in net payments related to pre-separation tax matters, partially offset by the impact of increased sales on accounts receivable levels.

The
amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $393 million, $323 million, and $806 million, respectively. In fiscal 2017
and 2016, these amounts included refunds of $23 million and payments of $471 million, respectively, related to pre-separation tax matters. During fiscal 2016, we received net
reimbursements of $321 million from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters. We do not expect a significant change in our income tax
payments as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

See
Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement and payments related to pre-separation tax matters.

Pension
contributions in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $54 million, $48 million, and $67 million, respectively. We expect pension contributions to be
$47 million in fiscal 2019, before consideration of any voluntary contributions.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Capital expenditures were $935 million, $679 million, and $603 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Capital spending increased in fiscal 2018 as a result of increased investments in growth initiatives, primarily in the Transportation Solutions segment. We expect fiscal 2019 capital spending levels
to be approximately 5-6% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance
productivity and manufacturing capabilities.

During
fiscal 2018, we acquired two businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $153 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired two businesses during fiscal 2017 for a
combined cash purchase price of $250 million, net of cash acquired. In fiscal 2016, we acquired four businesses, including Creganna, for a combined cash purchase price of $1.3 billion,
net of cash acquired. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.

During
fiscal 2016, we received net cash proceeds of $333 million related to the sale of our CPD business. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization

Total debt at fiscal year end 2018 and 2017 was $4,000 million and $4,344 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.

TEGSA,
our 100%-owned subsidiary, has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with a maturity date of December 2020 and total commitments of
$1,500 million. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2018 or 2017.

The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as
defined in the Credit



Facility)
for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility
and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of fiscal year end 2018, we were in compliance with
all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.

Periodically,
TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper
program are backed by the Credit Facility.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.

Payments
of common share dividends to shareholders were $588 million, $546 million, and $509 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. See Note 18
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding dividends on our common shares.

Future
dividends on our common shares, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends be approved, our
board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors
that they may deem relevant.

During
fiscal 2018 and 2016, our board of directors authorized increases of $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in the share repurchase program. We repurchased
approximately 10 million of our common shares for $966 million, 8 million of our common shares for $621 million, and 43 million of our common shares for
$2,610 million under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. At fiscal year end 2018, we had $1.0 billion of availability remaining under our share
repurchase authorization.

we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts
of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $47 million to pension plans in fiscal 2019, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments.

(6)

Other
long-term liabilities of $487 million are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items.

Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product
liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value
added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable
law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial
commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2019 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance,
and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks
involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities
and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At
fiscal year end 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $275 million.

As
discussed above, in September 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our SubCom business. Following the divestiture, we will continue to honor performance guarantees and
letters of credit related to the SubCom business' existing projects. These existing guarantees have a combined value of approximately $1.7 billion and are expected to expire at various dates
through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire within two years. Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new
performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years. We have contractual recourse against the
SubCom business if we are required to perform on these guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to



perform.
See Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the SubCom business.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are
summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that
involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605,

Revenue
Recognition

. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of
our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the shipping
point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is
recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical
experience and also is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Contract
revenues for construction related projects, which are generated in the SubCom business which is reported in discontinued operations, are recorded primarily using the
percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the
ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for
anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to unbilled receivables on construction related projects are
recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable.

See
Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the SubCom business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for information regarding our adoption of ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, in fiscal 2019.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets
with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, and customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1 to
50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when
events and circumstances warrant.

We
test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (a "component") if the component
constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2018, we had five reporting units, all of which contained
goodwill. There were two reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and one reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in
the



composition
of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our
annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure.

Goodwill
impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we
believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting unit-specific factors
including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and
management's judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In
the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds
the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is
recognized in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired
in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Fair
value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The
income approach has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and
market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future
periods.

We
completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and determined that no impairment existed.

Income Taxes

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the
calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial
statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of pre-tax operating income in various tax
jurisdictions, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of
taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in
the appropriate



jurisdictions.
Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An
increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.

Changes
in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we
conduct our operations. Under
the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions
based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax
loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax
authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our
current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Pension Liabilities

Our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our plans is recognized
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit
obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the
current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The
benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected
average remaining service lives of current participants.

Two
critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least
annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience.
Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected
future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2018, a 25
basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $124 million; a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of
our pension obligations by $111 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types
of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have increased or
decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2018 pension expense by $12 million.



At
fiscal year end 2018, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans' master trust is 10% return-seeking assets and 90% liability-hedging assets. Asset re-allocation to meet
that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 105%. Based on the funded status of
the plans as of fiscal year end 2018, our target asset allocation is 45% return-seeking and 55% liability-hedging.

Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued and recently adopted accounting
pronouncements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure

Organic Net Sales Growth

We present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to
results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and
acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely
under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture
activity.

Organic
net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance. Also,
management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also
a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The
tables presented in "Results of Operations" and "Segment Results" provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Organic
net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be
comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or
decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact
of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain statements in this Annual Report are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. These statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include, among others, the

There
may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business.



ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with
interest rate and foreign currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements. We utilize established risk management policies
and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks.

We
do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are
limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 credit rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty.

Foreign Currency Exposures

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency
forward contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our cross-currency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts
from the fiscal year end 2018 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by $101 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our
cross-currency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2017 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by $122 million. Such
gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions.

Interest Rate and Investment Exposures

We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To manage the
interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. We may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest
rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt. We also utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation
liabilities.

Based
on our floating rate debt balances at fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, a 50 basis point increase in the levels of the U.S. dollar interest rates, with all other variables held
constant, would have resulted in an immaterial increase in interest expense in both fiscal 2018 and 2017.

Commodity Exposures

Our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the effects of fluctuations in
the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges. We continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our
forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period. At fiscal year end 2018, our
commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, and copper, were in a net loss position of $34 million and had a notional value of $401 million. At fiscal year end
2017, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, and copper, were in a net gain position of $20 million and had a notional value of $314 million. A 10%
appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold, a troy ounce of silver, and a pound of copper, from the fiscal year end 2018 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our
forward contracts by $37 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a



troy
ounce of gold, a troy ounce of silver, and a pound of copper, from the fiscal year end 2017 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $33 million.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 28, 2018. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2018.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2018.



Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of
September 28, 2018, which is included in this Annual Report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the quarter ended September 28, 2018, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

years in the period ended September 28, 2018, and the related notes and schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 28, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting
as of September 28, 2018, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 13, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of TE Connectivity Ltd.:

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of
September 28, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
September 28, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by COSO.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the financial statements as of and for the fiscal year
ended September 28, 2018 of the Company and our report dated November 13, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of TE Connectivity Ltd. and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").

Description of the Business

TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") is a global technology and
manufacturing leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. For more than 75 years, our connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, have
enabled advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home.

We
operate through three reportable segments:

•

Transportation Solutions.

The Transportation Solutions segment is a leader
in connectivity and sensor technologies. Our products, which must withstand harsh conditions, are used in the automotive, commercial transportation, and sensors markets.

•

Industrial Solutions.

The Industrial Solutions segment is a leading
supplier of products that connect and distribute power, data, and signals. Our products are used in the industrial equipment; aerospace, defense, oil, and gas; and energy markets.

•

Communications Solutions.

The Communications Solutions segment is a leading
supplier of electronic components for the data and devices and the appliances markets.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in these
Consolidated Financial Statements include restructuring and other charges, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future
cash flows and discount rates associated with asset impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, estimated contract revenue and
related costs, legal contingencies, tax reserves and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension benefit cost. Actual results
could differ materially from these estimates.

Fiscal Year

We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday of September. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth
quarter reporting period includes 14 weeks. Fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 ended on September 28, 2018, September 29, 2017, and September 30, 2016, respectively.
Fiscal 2018 and 2017 were 52 weeks in length. Fiscal 2016 was a 53-week year.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

We consolidate entities in which we own or control more than 50% of the voting shares or otherwise have the ability to control through similar
rights. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included on the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of
acquisition or up to the date of disposal.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the
risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.

We
generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship
for a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We accept returned goods only when the customer
makes a verified claim and we have authorized the return. Generally, a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a
reduction of sales.

We
provide certain distributors with an inventory allowance for returns or scrap equal to a percentage of qualified purchases. A reserve for estimated returns and scrap allowances is
established at the time of the sale based on an agreed-upon, fixed percentage of sales to distributors and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Other
allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is
recorded as a reduction of sales. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate the amounts of future allowances.

See
"Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" below for information regarding our adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606,

Revenue from
Contracts with Customers

, in fiscal 2019.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out cost method.

Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net

Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense
when incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 10 to 20 years for land improvements, 5 to 40 years for
buildings and improvements, and 1 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.

We
periodically evaluate, when events and circumstances warrant, the net realizable value of property, plant, and equipment and other long-lived assets, relying on a number of factors
including



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

operating
results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the asset group are evaluated in
relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying asset group. Impairment of the carrying value is recognized whenever anticipated future
undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying value of the asset. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and
discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets
with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, and customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1 to
50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when
events and circumstances warrant.

At
fiscal year end 2018, we had five reporting units, all of which contained goodwill. There were two reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions
segments and one
reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their
relative fair values.

Goodwill
impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we
believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting unit-specific factors
including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and
management's judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In
the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds
the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is
recognized in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired
in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Fair
value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The
income approach has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and
market activity in

assessing
fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in research, development, and engineering expenses on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred, and building and overhead expenses. The amounts expensed in fiscal 2018, 2017, and
2016 were $606 million, $548 million, and $525 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

. Deferred
tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are
determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss carryforwards using tax rates in effect for the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our
operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the
extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss
carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to
changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and
related interest.

Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt, and derivative financial
instruments.

We
account for derivative financial instrument contracts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. For instruments not designated as hedges under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, the changes in
the instruments' fair value are recognized currently in earnings. For instruments designated as cash flow
hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which
the underlying hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of a cash flow hedge, including amounts excluded from the hedging relationship, are recognized currently in earnings. Changes in the
fair value of instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or liability hedged, with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability
being recognized currently in earnings.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

We
determine the fair value of our financial instruments by using methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. Standard
market conventions are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, including derivatives.

The
cash flows related to derivative financial instruments are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Our
derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks. Concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated, however, by our use of financial institutions
worldwide, substantially all of which have long-term Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, we utilize only conventional derivative financial
instruments. We are exposed to potential losses if a counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of its agreement. With respect to counterparty net asset positions recognized at fiscal year
end 2018, we have assessed the likelihood of counterparty default as remote. We currently provide guarantees from a wholly-owned subsidiary to the counterparties to our commodity swap derivatives and
exchange cash collateral with the counterparties to our cross-currency swap contracts. The likelihood of performance on the guarantees has been assessed as remote. For all other derivative financial
instruments, we are not required to provide, nor do we require counterparties to provide, collateral or other security.

Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

, specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon
the observable inputs utilized in valuation of certain assets and liabilities. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs
(lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. Fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:

•

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities.

•

Level 2.

Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and
liabilities, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

•

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no
market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flows methodologies, and similar techniques that use
significant unobservable inputs.

Derivative
financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are generally valued using level 2 inputs.

Financial
instruments other than derivative instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. These instruments are recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at book value. For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, we believe book value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. See Note 11 for disclosure of the fair value of debt. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial
instruments:

•

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents are valued at book
value, which we consider to be equivalent to unadjusted quoted prices (level 1).



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

•

Accounts receivable.

Accounts receivable are valued based on the net value
expected to be realized. The net realizable value generally represents an observable contractual agreement (level 2).

•

Accounts payable.

Accounts payable are valued based on the net value
expected to be paid, generally supported by an observable contractual agreement (level 2).

•

Debt.

The fair value of debt, including both current and non-current
maturities, is derived from quoted market prices or other pricing determinations based on the results of market approach valuation models using observable market data such as recently reported trades,
bid and offer information, and benchmark securities (level 2).

Pension Liabilities

The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference
between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be
paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to
irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors,
such as years of service and compensation.

Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected
average remaining service lives of current participants.

The
measurement of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on estimates and assumptions determined by our management. These valuations reflect the terms of the plans
and use participant-specific information such as compensation, age, and years of service, as well as certain assumptions, including estimates of discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of
compensation increases, interest crediting rates, and mortality rates.

Share-Based Compensation

We determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant. Share options are valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model;
restricted share awards and performance awards are valued using our end-of-day share price on the date of grant. The fair value is expensed ratably over the expected service period, with an allowance
made for estimated forfeitures based on historical employee activity. Estimates regarding the attainment of performance criteria are reviewed periodically; the cumulative impact of a change in
estimate regarding the attainment of performance criteria is recorded in the period in which that change is made.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation arrangements.

Currency Translation

For our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using fiscal year end exchange
rates. Sales and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
within equity.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, which are included in earnings, were immaterial in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016.

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring activities involve employee-related termination costs, facility exit costs, and asset impairments resulting from
reductions-in-force, migration of facilities or product lines from higher-cost to lower-cost countries, or consolidation of facilities within countries. We recognize termination costs based on
requirements established by severance policy, government law, or previous actions. Facility exit costs generally reflect the cost to terminate a facility lease before the end of its term (measured at
fair value at the time we cease using the facility) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the facility lease without future economic benefit to us. Restructuring activities often result in
the disposal or abandonment of assets that require an acceleration of depreciation or impairment reflecting the excess of the assets' carrying values over fair value.

The
recognition of restructuring costs require that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing, and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
To the extent our actual results differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimated liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring costs or the
reduction of liabilities already recognized. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure these balances are properly stated and the utilization of the
reserves are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.

Contingent Liabilities

We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the
loss is reasonably estimable. When a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists, we record the low end of the range. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is
often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. In addition, it is not uncommon for such matters
to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of that
loss can be made. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a loss is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-16, an update to
ASC 740,

Income Taxes

. This new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than
inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs. The update, which we will adopt on a modified



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

retrospective
basis, is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Adoption is expected to result in a $443 million cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings,
which represents the net reversal of all balances associated with deferred tax impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This will result in a decrease in other assets of
$798 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $418 million, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $63 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 which codified ASC 842,

Leases

. This guidance, as subsequently amended, requires
lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for most leases and is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are currently in the process of updating policies,
internal controls, financial statement disclosures, and systems to incorporate the
impact of the new standard in our financial reporting processes. We intend to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach in the period of adoption, as permitted by ASU
No. 2018-11. We expect that adoption will likely have a material impact to our Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, we currently do not expect adoption to have a material impact to our results
of operations or cash flows. We believe that we are following an appropriate timeline to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 which codified ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

. This guidance
supersedes ASC 605,

Revenue Recognition

, and introduces a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. ASC 606 also enhances disclosures
related to revenue recognition. ASC 606, as amended, is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2019. Significantly all our revenues are generated from the sale of products. Our Subsea Communications
("SubCom") business, which is reported in discontinued operations, generates contract revenues for construction related projects which are recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method.
Our review of existing contracts, which is complete, affirms that product revenue and contract revenue will continue to be recognized at a point in time and over-time, respectively, in a manner
consistent with current practice. See Notes 4 and 23 for additional information regarding our SubCom business. In fiscal 2018, we completed the process of updating policies, internal controls,
financial statement disclosures, and systems to incorporate the impact of the new standard in our financial reporting processes. We will adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective
approach and have determined that transition impacts, which relate primarily to incentive compensation arrangements, are not material to our results of operations or financial position.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, an update to ASC 220,

Income Statement—Reporting
Comprehensive Income

, to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the
"Act"). See Note 15 for additional information regarding the Act. We elected to early adopt this update in fiscal 2018 and reclassify the stranded tax effects resulting from the change
in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. This change in accounting principle resulted in a reclassification of $38 million, primarily associated with our pension plans, during the period
of adoption. The reclassification increased both accumulated other comprehensive loss and accumulated earnings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with no impact to total shareholders' equity.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, an update to ASC 715,

Compensation—Retirement Benefits,

which changes
the income statement presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs. The ASU requires that service costs be presented with other employee compensation costs within operating
income and that other cost components be presented outside of operating income. We elected to early adopt this update in fiscal 2018. The update was applied retrospectively and did not have a material
impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, an update to ASC 718,

Compensation—Stock Compensation

, to simplify
various aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees. We elected to early adopt this update in fiscal 2017. The provisions of the update addressing the accounting for excess tax
benefits and deficiencies were adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings and a corresponding increase in
deferred tax assets of $165 million. The provision of the update addressing the presentation on the statement of cash flows of employee taxes paid via the withholding of shares was applied
retrospectively and did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Adoption of other provisions, which were applied prospectively, also did not have a material impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fiscal 2018 Actions

During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting
the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. In connection with this program, during fiscal 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $142 million. We expect to complete all
restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2018 by the end of fiscal 2020 and to incur additional charges of approximately $15 million primarily in the Industrial Solutions segment.

Fiscal 2017 Actions

During fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural
improvements impacting all segments. In connection with this program, during fiscal 2018 and 2017, we recorded net restructuring credits of $4 million and charges of $147 million,
respectively. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2017 by the end of fiscal 2019 and anticipate that any additional charges will be insignificant.

Fiscal 2016 Actions

During fiscal 2016, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures
in the Communications Solutions segment.
In connection with this program, during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recorded net restructuring charges of $2 million, $2 million, and $127 million, respectively. We expect to
complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2016 by the end of fiscal 2019 and to incur additional employee severance charges of approximately $10 million primarily in the
Communications Solutions segment.

Gain on Divestiture

During fiscal 2016, we sold our Circuit Protection Devices ("CPD") business for net cash proceeds of $333 million. We recognized a
pre-tax gain of $144 million on the transaction. The CPD business was reported in our Communications Solutions segment.

4. Discontinued Operations

On September 16, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Subsea Communications ("SubCom") business for $325 million, subject to a final working capital
adjustment. The agreement provides that, if the purchaser sells the business within two years of the closing date, we will be entitled to 20% of the net proceeds of that future sale, as defined in the
agreement, in excess of $325 million. The sale of the SubCom business, which was previously included in our Communications Solutions segment, represents our exit from the telecommunications
market and is significant to our sales and profitability, both to the Communications Solutions segment and to the consolidated company. We have concluded that the divestiture is a strategic shift that
will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As a result, the SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and was reported as a discontinued
operation on our Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented.

Upon
entering into the definitive agreement, which we consider a level 2 observable input in the fair value hierarchy, we assessed the carrying value of the SubCom business and
determined that it was in excess of its fair value. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $19 million, which is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations on
the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to write the carrying value of the business down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. We expect to incur a pre-tax loss on sale of approximately
$90 million, related primarily to the recognition of
cumulative translation adjustment losses and the guarantee liabilities discussed below, which will be presented in income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. See Note 23 for additional information regarding the divestiture.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

4. Discontinued Operations (Continued)

Following
the divestiture, we will continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business' existing projects. These existing guarantees have a
combined value of approximately $1.7 billion and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire within two years. Also, under the
terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business
following the sale for a period of up to three years. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on these guarantees; however, based on historical
experience, we do not anticipate having to perform.

The
SubCom business generates contract revenues for construction related projects which are recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts
in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. Revisions
in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become
determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to unbilled receivables on construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become
determinable.

following table presents the summarized components of income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for the SubCom business and prior divestitures:

Assets
and liabilities held for sale at fiscal year end 2017 were classified as both current and noncurrent on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

During
fiscal 2016, we settled a lawsuit with the former shareholders of Com-Net, which we acquired in fiscal 2001, and paid an aggregate amount of $96 million. In connection with
the settlement, we recorded pre-tax credits of $30 million, representing a release of excess reserves, during fiscal 2016. This amount was reflected in income (loss) from discontinued
operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as the Com-Net case was associated with our former Wireless Systems business which was sold in fiscal 2009. Also during fiscal 2016, we
recognized an additional pre-tax gain of $29 million on the fiscal 2015 divestiture of our BNS business, related primarily to pension and net working capital adjustments.

The
Wireless Systems and BNS businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and were reported as such in all periods presented on the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the Wireless Systems and BNS businesses were included in the former Wireless Systems and Network Solutions segments, respectively.

The
fair values assigned to intangible assets were determined using the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty and the multi-period excess earnings methods. Both valuation
methods rely on management judgment, including expected future cash flows resulting from existing customer relationships, customer attrition rates, contributory effects of other assets utilized in the
business, peer group cost of capital and royalty rates, and other factors. Useful lives for intangible assets were determined based upon the remaining useful economic lives of the intangible assets
that are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows.

The
acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.

Goodwill
of $802 million was recognized in these transactions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. This goodwill is attributable primarily to cost savings and other synergies related to operational efficiencies including the consolidation of manufacturing, marketing, and
general and administrative functions. The goodwill has been allocated to the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments and is not deductible for tax purposes. However, prior to being
acquired by us, one of the fiscal 2016 acquisitions completed certain acquisitions that resulted in goodwill with an estimated value of $15 million that is deductible primarily for U.S. tax
purposes, which we will deduct through 2025.

Fiscal
2016 acquisitions contributed net sales of $167 million and operating income of $8 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations during fiscal 2016. The
operating income included $10 million of acquisition costs, $7 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments related to acquired inventories and
customer order backlog, and $2 million of integration costs.

fiscal year end 2018, 2017, and 2016, accumulated impairment losses for the Transportation Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Communications Solutions segments
were $2,191 million, $669 million, and $489 million, respectively.

During
fiscal 2018, we recognized goodwill of $78 million in the Industrial Solutions segment due primarily to recent acquisitions. During fiscal 2017, we acquired two businesses
and recognized goodwill of $130 million, which benefitted the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments. Also in fiscal 2017, we finalized the purchase price allocation of our
fiscal 2016 acquisitions, and the associated goodwill was reduced by $34 million. This reduction, which was primarily within the Industrial Solutions segment, is reflected in fiscal 2017
acquisitions in the above table. See Note 5 for additional information regarding acquisitions.

We
completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and determined that no impairment existed.

Tyco
Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with a maturity date of December
2020 and total commitments of $1,500 million. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2018 or 2017.

Borrowings
under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured,
long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Bank of America, N.A.'s base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus


/


of 1%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay
an annual facility fee ranging from 5.0 to 12.5 basis points based upon the amount of the lenders' commitments under the Credit Facility and the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA.

The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as
defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is
triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants.

Periodically,

The

12. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product
liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value
added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable
law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Environmental Matters

We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate
cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup
methods. As of fiscal year end 2018, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $15 million to $42 million,
and we accrued $17 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Leases

We have facility, land, vehicle, and equipment leases that expire at various dates. Rental expense under these operating leases was
$141 million, $147 million, and $137 million for fiscal 2018, 2017, and

Guarantees

In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown
damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing
facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At
fiscal year end 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $275 million.

13. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements

We use derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, investment, and commodity risks.

The
effects of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were immaterial for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016.

Foreign Exchange Risks and Hedges of Net Investment

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency
forward contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. We expect that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with the cash flow
hedge-designated instruments addressing foreign exchange risks will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statement of Operations within the next twelve months.

During
fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of €1,000 million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency
exchange risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make quarterly interest payments in euros at 3.50% per
annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.33% per annum. Upon maturity of these contracts in fiscal 2022,



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

we
will pay the notional value of the contracts in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. In connection with the cross-currency swap contracts, we are required to post cash collateral
with our counterparties.

At
fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, our cross-currency swap contracts were in liability positions of $100 million and $96 million, respectively, and were recorded in other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, collateral paid to our counterparties approximated the derivative positions and was recorded in prepaid expenses and
other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The impacts of our cross-currency swap contracts were as follows:

We
hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany loans and external borrowings denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these
hedges was $4,064 million and $3,110 million at fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, respectively. The impacts of our hedging program were as follows:

Interest Rate and Investment Risk Management

We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To manage the
interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. We may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest
rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt. We also utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation
liabilities.

Commodity Hedges

As part of managing the exposure to certain commodity price fluctuations, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in prices of commodities used in production.

13. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

At fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, our commodity hedges had notional values of $401 million and $314 million, respectively. We expect that significantly all of the balance
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with the commodity hedges will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statement of Operations within the next twelve months.

Fair Value Measurements

Financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, which consist of derivative instruments and marketable securities, were
immaterial at fiscal year end 2018 and 2017.

14. Retirement Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

We have a number of contributory and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of our non-U.S. and U.S. employees,
designed in accordance with local customs and practice.

Amortization
of prior service credit is included in other in the above table summarizing the components of net periodic pension benefit cost.

In
fiscal 2018 and 2017, unrecognized actuarial gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were primarily the result of higher discount rates and favorable asset
performance for both non-U.S. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans as compared to fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The
estimated amortization of actuarial losses from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic pension benefit cost for non-U.S. and U.S. defined benefit pension
plans in fiscal 2019 is expected to be $24 million and $17 million, respectively. The estimated amortization of prior service
credit from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic pension benefit cost for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2019 is expected to be $7 million.

In
determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations.

The
investment strategies for non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans are governed locally. Our investment strategy for our pension plans is to manage the plans on a going concern basis. Current
investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. Projected returns
are based primarily on pro forma asset allocation, expected long-term returns, and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management.

At
fiscal year end 2018, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans' master trust is 10% return-seeking assets and 90% liability-hedging assets. Return-seeking assets,
including non-U.S. and U.S. equity securities, are assets intended to generate returns in excess of pension liability growth.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Retirement Plans (Continued)

Liability-hedging
assets, including government and corporate bonds, are assets intended to have characteristics similar to pension liabilities and are used to better match asset cash flows with
expected obligation cash flows. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded
status of the plans exceeds 105%. Based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2018, our target asset allocation is 45% return-seeking and 55% liability-hedging.

weighted-average asset allocation and weighted-average asset allocation for non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans were as follows:

Our
common shares are not a direct investment of our pension funds; however, the pension funds may indirectly include our shares. The aggregate amount of our common shares would not be
considered material relative to the total pension fund assets.

Our
funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which we operate as well as to make discretionary voluntary contributions
from time to time. We expect to make the minimum required contributions of $42 million and $5 million to our non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans, respectively, in fiscal 2019. We may also
make voluntary contributions at our discretion.

14. Retirement Plans (Continued)

Changes in Level 3 assets in non-U.S. plans were primarily the result of purchases in fiscal 2018 and 2017.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

We maintain several defined contribution retirement plans, the most significant of which is located in the U.S. These plans include 401(k)
matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants'
compensation and was $62 million, $60 million, and $52 million for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans

We maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A record keeping
account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds correspond to a number of
funds in our 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. At fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, total deferred compensation liabilities were
$189 million and $157 million, respectively, and were recorded primarily in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 13 for additional information regarding
our risk management strategy related to deferred compensation liabilities.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension and 401(k) benefits, we also provide certain health care coverage continuation for qualifying retirees from the
date of retirement to age 65. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was $18 million and $19 million at fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the underfunded status
of the postretirement benefit plans was included primarily in long-term pension and postretirement liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Activity during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 was not
significant.

The
income tax benefit for fiscal 2018 included a $1,222 million net income tax benefit associated with the tax impacts of certain legal entity restructurings and intercompany
transactions that occurred in the quarter ended September 28, 2018. The net income tax benefit of $1,222 million related primarily to the recognition of certain non-U.S. loss
carryforwards and basis differences in subsidiaries expected to be utilized against future taxable income, partially offset by a $46 million increase in the valuation allowance for certain U.S.
federal tax credit carryforwards. The income tax benefit for fiscal 2018 also included $567 million of income tax expense related to the tax impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") and
a $61 million net income tax benefit related to the tax impacts of certain legal entity restructurings that occurred in the quarter ended December 29, 2017. See "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"
below for additional information regarding the Act.

The
income tax expense for fiscal 2017 included a $52 million income tax benefit associated with the tax impacts of certain intercompany transactions and the corresponding
reduction in the valuation allowance for U.S. tax loss carryforwards, a $40 million income tax benefit related to share-based payments and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, and a
$14 million income tax benefit associated with

tax matters. See Note 2 for additional information regarding recently adopted accounting pronouncements.

The
income tax benefit for fiscal 2016 included a $1,135 million income tax benefit related to the effective settlement of tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000, partially
offset by a $91 million income tax charge related to an increase to the valuation allowance for certain U.S. deferred tax assets. Additionally, the tax benefit for fiscal 2016 included an
$83 million net income tax benefit related to tax settlements in certain other tax jurisdictions, partially offset by an income tax charge related to certain legal entity restructurings. See
"Internal Revenue Service Audits" below for additional information regarding settlements with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS").

In
fiscal 2016, the increase to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related primarily to certain U.S. federal and state tax loss and credit carryforwards. Based on our
forecast of taxable income for certain U.S. tax reporting groups, U.S. tax loss and credit carryforwards finalized as a result of settlement of the disputed debt matter with the IRS, and certain tax
planning actions and strategies, we believed it was more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized.

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $2,191 million and $3,627 million at fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, respectively, related principally to the uncertainty
of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. During fiscal 2018, tax loss and credit carryforwards decreased
primarily as a result of a $1,675 million (tax effected) recovery of prior years' net write-downs of investments in subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions, offset by a corresponding decrease to
the valuation allowance. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

We
have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in the
future. No additional provision has been made for Swiss or non-Swiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences
related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded
that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of fiscal year end 2018, certain subsidiaries had approximately $23 billion of cumulative
undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and
research and development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such
subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in
subsidiaries. As of fiscal year end 2018, we had approximately $11.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to
distribute to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently
reinvested. We estimate that up to $0.9 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial

Statements
if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are
designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.

Uncertain Tax Positions

As of fiscal year end 2018, we had total unrecognized income tax benefits of $566 million. If recognized in future years,
$467 million of these currently unrecognized income tax benefits would impact income tax expense (benefit) and the effective tax rate. As of fiscal year end 2017, we had total unrecognized
income tax benefits of $501 million. If recognized in future years, $431 million of these currently unrecognized income tax benefits would impact income tax expense (benefit) and the
effective tax rate. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized income tax benefits:

We
record accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense (benefit). As of fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, we had $60 million of
accrued interest and
penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recorded primarily in income taxes. During fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recognized income tax expense of
$5 million, benefits of $5 million, and benefits of $765 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We
file income tax returns on a unitary, consolidated, or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions, which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to
4 years. Various state and local income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal.

Our
non-U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns in the countries in which they have operations. Generally, these countries have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to
10 years. Various non-U.S. subsidiary income tax returns are currently in the process of examination by taxing authorities.

In
most jurisdictions, taxing authorities retain the ability to review prior tax years and to adjust any net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from these years that are
utilized in a subsequent period.

Although
it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that approximately $130 million of unrecognized income tax benefits, excluding
the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months.

We
are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of fiscal
year end 2018.

Other Income Tax Matters

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, the President of the U.S. signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") into law. The Act includes numerous
significant changes to existing tax law, including a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, further limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and
certain executive compensation, repeal of the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, and imposition of a territorial tax system with a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign
subsidiaries. While some of the new provisions of the Act will impact us in fiscal 2019 and beyond, the change in the tax rate was effective January 1, 2018. In the period of enactment, we were
required to revalue our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new tax rate. Accordingly, during fiscal 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $567 million primarily in
connection with the write-down of our U.S. federal deferred tax
asset for net operating loss and interest carryforwards to the lower tax rate. Included in the expense of $567 million was an income



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Income Taxes (Continued)

tax
benefit of $34 million related to the reduction in the existing valuation allowance recorded against certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards. The limitations on interest expense
deductions contained in the Act are expected to increase prospective taxable income and thereby allow the utilization of more tax credits in future years. As a Swiss corporation, the one-time
repatriation tax imposed by the Act will not be significant to us.

The
Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, and in certain instances, lacks clarity and is subject to interpretation until additional IRS guidance is
issued. The ultimate impact of the Act may differ from our estimates due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions we made as well as any forthcoming regulatory guidance.

Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets

In fiscal 2018, there were certain sales of assets other than inventory between affiliated companies that are consolidated for financial
statement purposes but file separate tax returns. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the tax impact of these intra-entity transfers of assets was deferred and not recognized. Such transactions
resulted in a $674 million increase to other assets and a $48 million increase to prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet during fiscal 2018. See
Note 2 for information regarding our adoption of ASU No. 2016-16 in fiscal 2019 and the net reversal of all balances associated with deferred tax impacts of intra-entity transfers of
assets other than inventory.

Tax Sharing Agreement

Under a Tax Sharing Agreement entered into upon our separation from Tyco International plc ("Tyco International") in fiscal 2007, we,
Tyco International, and Covidien plc ("Covidien") share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of income tax liabilities that arise from
adjustments made by tax authorities to the collective income tax returns for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain
guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. We have substantially settled all U.S. federal income tax matters with the IRS for periods covered under the Tax
Sharing Agreement. Certain shared U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax matters remain open. We do not expect these matters will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position,
or cash flows. As a result of subsequent transactions, Tyco International plc ("Tyco International") and Covidien plc ("Covidien") now operate as part of Johnson Controls
International plc and Medtronic plc, respectively.

Internal Revenue Service Audits

As previously disclosed, in fiscal 2013, the IRS effectively settled its audit of all tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000, excluding one
issue involving the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. In fiscal 2016, the U.S. Tax Court resolved all aspects of the disputed debt matter for the 1997 to 2000 audit cycle and
the Appeals Division of the IRS effectively settled the intercompany debt issues on appeal for subsequent audit cycles (years 2001 to 2007). In connection with these developments, in fiscal 2016, we
recognized an income tax benefit of $1,135 million, representing a reduction in tax reserves, and other expense of $604 million, representing a reduction of associated indemnification
receivables, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Income Taxes (Continued)

During
fiscal 2016, in connection with the disputed debt matter, we made a payment to the IRS of $443 million for tax deficiencies for which we were the primary obligor.
Concurrent with remitting this payment, we received net reimbursements of $303 million from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters.

16. Other Income (Expense), Net

In fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recorded net other income of $1 million, net other expense of $42 million, and net other expense of $677 million, respectively. In
fiscal 2016, net other expense was primarily pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien and included $604 million related to the effective settlement of tax
matters for the years 1997 through 2000 and $46 million related to a tax settlement in another tax jurisdiction. See Note 15 for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement
and settlements.

There

respectively, because the instruments' underlying exercise prices were greater than the average market prices of our common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive.

Common Shares

We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of
association, and our Swiss organizational regulations. Accordingly, the par value of our common shares is stated in Swiss francs ("CHF"). We continue to use the U.S. dollar, however, as our reporting
currency on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Subject
to certain conditions specified in our articles of association, we are authorized to increase our conditional share capital by issuing new shares in aggregate not exceeding 50%
of our authorized shares. In March 2018, our shareholders reapproved and extended through March 14, 2020, our board of directors' authorization to issue additional new shares, subject to
certain conditions specified in the articles of association, in aggregate not exceeding 50% of the amount of our authorized shares.

fiscal 2017 and 2016, our shareholders approved the cancellation of 26 million and 31 million shares, respectively, purchased under our share repurchase program. These
capital reductions by cancellation of shares were subject to a notice period and filing with the commercial register in Switzerland.

Contributed Surplus

During fiscal 2017, cumulative equity transactions, including dividend activity and treasury share cancellations, reduced our contributed
surplus balance to zero with residual activity recorded against accumulated earnings as reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Equity. To the extent that the contributed surplus
balance continues to be zero, the impact of future transactions that normally would have been recorded as a reduction of contributed surplus will be recorded in accumulated earnings. Contributed
surplus established for Swiss tax and statutory purposes ("Swiss Contributed Surplus"), is not impacted by our GAAP treatment.

Swiss
Contributed Surplus, subject to certain conditions, is a freely distributable reserve. As of fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, Swiss Contributed Surplus was
CHF 6,724 million and CHF 7,300 million, respectively (equivalent to $5,809 million and $6,420 million, respectively).

Dividends

We paid cash dividends to shareholders of $1.68, $1.54, and $1.40 per share in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Under
Swiss law, subject to certain conditions, dividends paid from reserves from capital contributions (equivalent to Swiss Contributed Surplus) are exempt from Swiss withholding tax.
Dividends on our shares must be approved by our shareholders.

20. Share Plans

Our equity compensation plans, of which the TE Connectivity Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive Plan, amended and restated as of March 8, 2017 (the "2017 Plan"), is the primary
plan, provide for the award of annual performance bonuses and long-term performance awards, including share options; restricted, performance, and deferred share units; and other share-based awards
(collectively, "Awards") and allow for the use of unissued shares or treasury shares to be used to satisfy such Awards. As of fiscal year end 2018, our plans provided for a maximum of
77 million shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the plans. A total of 20 million shares remained available for issuance under our plans as
of fiscal year end 2018.

Share-Based Compensation Expense

Share-based compensation expense, which was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations, was as follows:

We
recognized a related tax benefit associated with our share-based compensation arrangements of $20 million, $31 million, and $28 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and
2016, respectively.

Restricted Share Awards

Restricted share awards, which are generally in the form of restricted share units, are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of
vesting are determined at the time of grant. All restrictions on an award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies retirement requirements, a portion of the award
may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Recipients of restricted share units have no voting rights, but do receive dividend equivalents. For grants that vest through
passage of time, the fair value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on the closing
value of our shares on the grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest in increments over a period of four years as determined by the management development and compensation committee.

As
of fiscal year end 2018, there was $66 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted share awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.6 years.

Performance Share Awards

Performance share awards, which are generally in the form of performance share units, are granted with pay-out subject to vesting requirements
and certain performance conditions that are determined at the time of grant. Based on our performance, the pay-out of performance share units can range from 0% to 200% of the number of units
originally granted. The grant-date fair value of performance share awards is expensed over the period of performance once achievement of the performance criteria is deemed probable. Recipients of
performance share units have no voting rights but do receive dividend equivalents. Performance share awards generally vest after a period of three years as determined by the management development and
compensation committee.

As
of fiscal year end 2018, there was $34 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share options granted under our share option plans. The cost is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Share-Based Compensation Assumptions

The grant-date fair value of each share option grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Use of a valuation model
requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. We employ our historical share volatility when calculating the grant-date fair value of our share option grants
using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Currently, we do not have exchange-traded options of sufficient duration to employ an implied volatility assumption in the calculation and
therefore rely solely on the historical volatility calculation. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment
termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term that approximated the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected
annual dividend per share was based on our expected dividend rate. The recognized share-based compensation expense was net of estimated forfeitures, which are based on voluntary termination behavior
as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

We operate through three reportable segments: Transportation Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Communications Solutions. See Note 1 for a description of the segments in which
we operate.

Segment
performance is evaluated based on net sales and operating income. Generally, we consider all expenses to be of an operating nature and, accordingly, allocate them to each
reportable segment. Costs specific to a segment are charged to the segment. Corporate expenses, such as headquarters administrative costs, are allocated to the segments based on segment operating
income. Intersegment sales were not material and were recorded at selling prices that approximate market prices. Corporate assets are allocated to the segments based on segment assets.
