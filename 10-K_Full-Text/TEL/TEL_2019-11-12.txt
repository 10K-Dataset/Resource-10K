1.  BUSINESS

General

TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity” or the “Company,” which may be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a global industrial technology leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. Our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, enable advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home.

We became an independent, publicly traded company in 2007; however, through our predecessor companies, we trace our foundations in the connectivity business back to 1941. We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations.

We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday of September. Fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were 52 weeks in length and ended on September 27, 2019, September 28, 2018, and September 29, 2017, respectively. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period includes 14 weeks, with the next such occurrence taking place in fiscal 2022.

Customers

As an industry leader, we have established close working relationships with many of our customers. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products.

Our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support. We believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate, our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers.

We manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors.

No single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017.

Sales and Distribution

We maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate. Our net sales by geographic region

(1)

as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows:

(1)

Net sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale.

We sell our products into approximately 150 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers. In fiscal 2019, our direct sales represented approximately 80% of total net sales. We also sell our products indirectly via third-party distributors.

We maintain distribution centers around the world. Products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, however, products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. Our global coverage positions us near our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road, rail, sea, and air. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile.

Seasonality and Backlog

We experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically the strongest quarters of our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets.

Certain of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases.



Customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business and market conditions. Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. Backlog by reportable segment was as follows:

We expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2019 will be filled during fiscal 2020.

Competition

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers. Competition is generally based on breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, and service. Our markets have generally been growing but with downward pressure on prices.

Raw Materials

We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding; precious metals such as gold and silver for plating; and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand.

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.

We own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.

While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents.

Management Team and Employees

We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry.

Our strong employee base, along with their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company’s success. We continue to emphasize employee development and training, and we embrace diversity and inclusion.



We have employees located throughout the world. As of fiscal year end 2019, we employed approximately 78,000 people worldwide, of whom 31,000 were in the EMEA region, 22,000 were in the Asia–Pacific region, and 25,000 were in the Americas region. Of our total employees, approximately 49,000 were employed in manufacturing.

Government Regulation and Supervision

The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.

Environmental

Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials in products, and chemical usage. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards; staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues; periodic compliance auditing; training; and other measures. We also have a program for compliance with the European Union (“EU”) Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the China Restriction of Hazardous Substances law, the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) Regulation, and similar laws.

Compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. For example, laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, available information, and applicable laws, as of fiscal year end 2019, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $15 million to $43 million, and we accrued $18 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.

ITEM

1A.  RISK FACTORS

Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Risks Relating to the Macroeconomic Environment and Our Global Presence

Conditions in global or regional economies, capital and money markets, and banking systems, and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally, including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit, end demand from consumer and industrial markets, and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults. Any of these economic factors could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow, and ability to obtain financing. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full. Further, our vendors may experience similar problems, which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels. If regional or global economic conditions deteriorate, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Also, deterioration in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other long-lived assets. Impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and financial position.

Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in United States (“U.S.”) dollars; however, a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S. Changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue. Approximately 60% of our net sales for fiscal 2019 were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect non-U.S. dollar revenue to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales. We have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure. Therefore, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the euro or Asian currencies, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and income will decrease.

We manage certain cash, intercompany, and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by the counterparty to these contracts, our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful.

We could suffer significant business interruptions.

Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers, and the supply chains that support their operations, may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, or floods; or other disasters such as fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war, disease, or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes. If a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events, our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

We could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets.

Concerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with concerns about credit, inflation, or deflation, have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities, including fixed income and equity securities, which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios. In addition, the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved. A decrease in the value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.



Disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding.

The global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted, which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit. Downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital. As a result, we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business. Our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures. The extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity, the cost of financing, and other general economic and business conditions.

We are subject to global risks of political, economic, and military instability.

Our workforce; manufacturing, research, administrative, and sales facilities; markets; customers; and suppliers are located throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including:

·

changes in global trade policies, including sanctions, tariffs, trade barriers, and trade disputes;

·

regulations related to customs and import/export matters;

·

variations in lengths of payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable;

·

tax law and regulatory changes in Switzerland, the U.S., and the EU among other jurisdictions, including tax law and regulatory changes that may be effected as a result of tax policy recommendations from quasi-governmental organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country, changes to the terms of income tax treaties, and difficulties in the tax-efficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions;

·

employment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which we currently operate;

·

difficulties protecting intellectual property;

·

instability in economic or political conditions, including sovereign debt levels, Eurozone uncertainty, inflation, recession, actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;

·

the impact of the decision of the United Kingdom to exit from the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, including affecting our relationships with existing and potential customers and suppliers. The effects of Brexit, including long-lasting effects of Brexit on EU market access, will depend on more permanent agreements between the United Kingdom and the EU to be negotiated during the transition period; and

·

the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements.

We have sizeable operations in China, including 18 principal manufacturing sites. In addition, approximately 18% of our net sales in fiscal 2019 were made to customers in China. Economic conditions in China have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain. In addition, the legal and regulatory system in China is still developing and subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and transactions with customers in China could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions, changes to the regulatory environment, or interpretation of Chinese law.

In addition, any downgrade by rating agencies of long-term U.S. sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and liquidity.



Changes in U.S. federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to U.S. persons treated as owning 10% or more of our shares.

Although we are a Swiss corporation, recent U.S. tax law changes have expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules and cause certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be treated as Controlled Foreign Corporations (“CFCs”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. person that is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as owning, directly, indirectly, or constructively, 10% or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as CFCs, whether or not we make any distributions to such U.S. shareholder. A U.S. person that owns 10% or more of our shares should consult a tax adviser regarding the potential implications to it of these changes in U.S. federal income tax law. The risk of U.S. federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries that now are treated as CFCs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us, and others from investing in us, which could impact the demand for, and value of, our shares.

Risks Relating to the Industry in Which We Operate

We are dependent on the automotive and other industries.

We are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products, and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets. Periodic downturns in our customers’ industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Approximately 42% of our net sales for fiscal 2019 were to customers in the automotive industry. The automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers. Additionally, the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions. As a supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic or credit conditions and changes in the operations, products, business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automotive manufacturers, as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers.

During fiscal 2019, approximately 14% of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market, 10% of our net sales were to customers in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market, and 9% of our net sales were to customers in the commercial transportation market. Demand for industrial equipment is dependent upon economic conditions, including customer investment in factory automation, intelligent buildings, and process control systems, as well as market conditions in the medical, rail transportation, solar and lighting, and other major industrial markets we serve. The aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand, depending on worldwide economic and political conditions. Demand in the oil and gas market is impacted by oil price volatility. The commercial transportation industry can experience variability in demand depending on the economic environment and market conditions in the heavy truck, construction, agriculture, and recreational vehicle markets.

We encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry.

We operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future. Our overall competitive position depends on various factors including the price, quality, and performance of our products; the level of customer service; the development of new technology; our ability to participate in emerging markets; and customers’ expectations relating to socially responsible operations. The competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large, diversified manufacturers to small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years, and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price, and in some instances may have the benefit of lower production costs for certain products. We cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.



We are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue.

Substantially all markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences, which are rapid in certain end markets. Our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design, develop, introduce, and sell new and innovative products; to modify existing products; and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change. There are numerous risks inherent in these processes, including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands.

Like other suppliers to the electronics industry, we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices.

We have historically experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, continuing pressure to lower our prices. In recent years, we have experienced price erosion averaging from 1% to 2% each year. To maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We

may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate.

Many of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become more concentrated in recent years, including the automotive, data and devices, and aerospace and defense industries. Consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us. In addition, as our customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase. Our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends may adversely affect the margins on our products, particularly for commodity components.

The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short.

The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle. As a result, the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover, and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Risks Relating to Our Operations

Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.

We are a large buyer of resins, chemicals, additives, and metals, including copper, gold, silver, aluminum, brass, steel, and zinc. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, the prices of many of these raw materials continue to fluctuate. If we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials, it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials. To the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers, our margins may decline, materially affecting our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In addition, we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices. The success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials. We could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate.

In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (“conflict minerals” or “3TG”) mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (“DRC”) and adjoining countries (together with the DRC, the “Covered Countries”) in their products. These requirements could affect the sourcing, pricing, and availability of 3TG used in the manufacture of certain of our products, and may result in only a limited pool of suppliers who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3TG from the Covered Countries. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain non-conflict 3TG in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Further, since our supply chain is complex, we may face



reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures.

We may use components and products manufactured by third parties.

We may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. If these third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged.

Our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain management and executive management employees.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our management and executive management employees and hire new management and executive management employees to replace, succeed, or add to members of our management team. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Competition for management talent is intense, and any difficulties we may have to retain or hire members of management to achieve our objectives may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise confidential information, and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation.

Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations; compromise information belonging to us, our employees, customers, and suppliers; and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the normal course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information and customer and employee data, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats, our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, to date none of these threats have had a material impact on our business or operations.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens. Our outstanding notes’ indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability to consolidate, merge, and sell assets.

Although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our continued ability to meet the Credit Facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility or indentures. Upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our Credit Facility and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our Credit Facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration



of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder.

The indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event.

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely.

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including:

·

our quarterly or annual earnings;

·

quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide or changes thereto;

·

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

·

volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global and regional economic conditions and investors’ concerns about potential risks to future economic growth;

·

changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;

·

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;

·

tax legislative and regulatory actions and proposals in Switzerland, the U.S., the EU, and other jurisdictions;

·

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; and

·

the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business.

Risks Relating to Strategic Transactions

Future acquisitions may not be successful.

We regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses, product lines, or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings, and we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years. We anticipate that we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy. We cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future. We also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity.

If we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash, the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks, public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures. We cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to complete an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares.



Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures. Any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel; the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; the disruption of our business; and the potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered.

Risks Relating to Intellectual Property, Litigation, and Regulations

Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology.

The electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry, companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the importance of the technology, product, patent, trademark, or trade secret in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

In the normal course of business, we are, from time to time, a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, anti-competitive behavior, product liability, breach of contract, and employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

If any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations, our business may suffer.

Our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the U.S. and the EU. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We may also be subject to third-party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless



or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, government enforcement actions, and reputational risk.

We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate and where our products are sold. These laws and regulations govern, among other things:

·

the generation, storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials;

·

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment;

·

investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites;

·

greenhouse gas emissions;

·

product hazardous material content; and

·

the health and safety of our employees.

We may not have been, or we may not always be, in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance requirements.

Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal, and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigation, removal, and remediation costs under certain federal and state laws is retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notifications from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, other environmental agencies, and third parties that conditions at a number of currently and formerly-owned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites. We also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation and/or remediation is necessary.

While we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury, property damage, and/or cleanup in the future based on our past, present, or future business activities.

Our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, and recycling.

The EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws include but are not limited to the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances, End of Life Vehicle, and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives; the EU REACH Regulation; and the China law on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution by Electronic Information Products. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. These laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These laws could make the manufacture or sale of



our products more expensive or impossible, could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions, and could result in liability for product recalls, penalties, or other claims.

Risks Relating to Our Swiss Jurisdiction of Incorporation

As a Swiss corporation, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares.

As a Swiss corporation, our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated Swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements. In addition, our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors, but this authorization is limited to (i) authorized share capital up to 50% of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years, which authorization period ends on March 14, 2020, approved by our shareholders at our March 14, 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders and (ii) conditional share capital of up to 50% of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital. Swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares, and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions, including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation, dividends, and/or voting. Moreover, under Swiss law, we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders, which would delay the timing to execute such actions. Such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management. While we do not believe that Swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us, we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors.

We might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.

We anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) in order to make the distributions on our shares to shareholders free of Swiss withholding tax. Various tax law and corporate law proposals in Switzerland, if passed in the future, may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital, or that Swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future. In addition, over the long term, the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited. Our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.

Under Swiss law, the registered share capital in our unconsolidated Swiss statutory financial statements is required to be denominated in Swiss francs. Although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in U.S. dollars, shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the Swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital. If the U.S. dollar were to increase in value relative to the Swiss franc, the U.S. dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without Swiss withholding tax will decrease.

We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares.

The Swiss Code of Obligations regulates a corporation’s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares



beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation. Additionally, various corporate law proposals in Switzerland, if passed in the future, may affect our ability to repurchase our shares. Our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings.

Our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by Swiss law for Swiss companies like us that issue registered shares (as opposed to bearer shares). This provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights, holders of our shares must be registered in our share register (Aktienbuch) as shareholders with voting rights. Only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders’ meetings, but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends, distributions, preemptive rights, advance subscription rights, and liquidation proceeds. The board of directors may, in its discretion, refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements in our articles of association. Additionally, various proposals in Switzerland for corporate law changes, if passed in the future, may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks. Such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable.

Our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered “anti-takeover” provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions, among others:

·

shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent, and

·

restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15% or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors.

These provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of our issued voting shares, which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price, or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders. Our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital (in either case, representing a maximum of 50% of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in case of issuances from authorized capital, until March 14, 2020 unless re-authorized by shareholders for a subsequent two-year period) without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders’ preemptive rights or advance subscription rights, for the purpose of the defense of an actual, threatened, or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in relation to which the board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial advisor, has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. We note that Swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under Swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital. In addition, the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), on which our shares are listed, requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20% or more of the outstanding shares or voting power, with limited exceptions.

Global legislative and regulatory actions and proposals could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate.

Various legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lower-tax jurisdictions. There has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives, such as:

·

the OECD’s initiative to develop agreed-upon best practices to prevent base erosion and profit shifting, which contemplate changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to the distribution of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions,



·

EU and other country efforts to adopt certain OECD proposals and modified OECD proposals (including the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, state aid cases, and various transparency proposals), and

·

tax policy changes in the U.S., such as additional federal tax reform measures, new tax regulations, and revisions to the Model Income Tax Treaty.

If these proposals are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business, they could, among other things, cause double taxation, increase audit risk, and materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives, and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us.

Legislation in the U.S. could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to U.S. companies that have moved to lower-tax jurisdictions.

We expect the U.S. Congress to continue to consider implementation and/or expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad. We cannot predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business, or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us. In addition, we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of our non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us.

Swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

As we are organized under the laws of Switzerland, it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as they are contrary to Switzerland’s public policy.

Swiss law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers. Thus, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.

2.  PROPERTIES

Our principal executive office is located in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. As of fiscal year end 2019, we owned approximately 17 million square feet and leased approximately 9 million square feet of aggregate floor space, used primarily for manufacturing, warehousing, and office space. We believe our facilities are suitable for the conduct of our business and adequate for our current needs.

We manufacture our products in approximately 25 countries worldwide. Our manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of our manufacturing processes, including our primary processes of stamping, plating, molding, extrusion, beaming, and assembly. We consider the productive capacity of our manufacturing facilities sufficient. As of fiscal year end 2019, our principal centers of manufacturing output by segment and geographic region were as follows:

3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. In addition, we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the normal course of business, we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third party’s patent were to be determined against us, we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable, we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount.

Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is presented below. Discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 can be found in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018.

The following discussion includes organic net sales growth which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” for additional information regarding this measure.

Overview

We are a global industrial technology leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. Our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, enable advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home.

Fiscal 2019 included the following:

●

Our fiscal 2019 net sales decreased 3.9% from fiscal 2018 levels due to sales declines in the Communications Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments, partially offset by growth in the Industrial Solutions segment. On an organic basis, our net sales decreased 1.7% in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.

●

Our net sales by segment were as follows:

●

Transportation Solutions

—Our net sales decreased 5.7% due primarily to sales declines in the automotive end market.

●

Industrial Solutions

—Our net sales increased 2.5% primarily as a result of increased sales in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market.

●

Communications Solutions

—Our net sales decreased 9.2% due to sales declines in both the appliances and the data and devices end markets.

●

During fiscal 2019, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $1.84 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.46 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.

●

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2,454 million in fiscal 2019.

​



Outlook

In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect our net sales to be between $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion as compared to $3.35 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect our net sales to be between $12.7 billion and $13.3 billion in fiscal 2020 as compared to $13.4 billion in fiscal 2019. These decreases are primarily due to sales declines in the Communications Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. Additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2019 and for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 is as follows:

●

Transportation Solutions

—We expect our net sales to decrease in the automotive end market as a result of declines in global automotive production. However, we expect our content gains to partially offset the impact of the overall market decline. We expect our net sales to decrease in the commercial transportation end market as a result of market weakness.

●

Industrial Solutions

—We expect our net sales declines in the industrial equipment end market to be largely offset by sales increases in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas and the energy end markets. In the industrial equipment end market, market weakness in industrial applications is expected to be partially offset by continued growth in medical applications.

●

Communications Solutions

—We expect our net sales to decline in both the data and devices and the appliances end markets due to

market weakness across all regions and reduced demand resulting from high inventory levels at distributors.

We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.93 to $0.99 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2020, we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.21 to $4.61 per share.

The outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2019 reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $62 million and $0.03 per share, respectively. The outlook for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $229 million and $0.11 per share, respectively.

The above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.

We are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. We continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. See further discussion in “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (“Swiss Tax Reform”) in September 2018, and it was approved by public vote in May 2019. Certain measures became effective in fiscal 2019 and accordingly are reflected on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2019, the canton of Schaffhausen enacted Swiss Tax Reform into law. We are currently assessing the impacts of the cantonal implementation, including reductions in tax rates. We expect to recognize approximately $350 million of income tax expense related to the write-down of certain deferred tax assets to the lower tax rates in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the period of enactment. This income tax charge is not reflected in the above outlook; however, our outlook does reflect an expected increase of approximately 400 basis points in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 as a result of other provisions of Swiss Tax Reform. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Swiss Tax Reform.

​



Acquisitions

During fiscal 2019, we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $296 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Transportation Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.

We acquired two businesses during fiscal 2018 for a combined cash purchase price of $153 million, net of cash acquired. In fiscal 2019, we received $13 million as a result of a customary net working capital settlement for one of the acquisitions. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.

Pending Acquisition

During fiscal 2019, we entered into a business combination agreement and commenced a voluntary public tender offer for all outstanding shares of First Sensor AG (“First Sensor”), a provider of sensing solutions based in Germany. The offer was accepted for approximately 72% of First Sensor’s shares. The transaction, including the assumption of First Sensor’s outstanding net debt and minority interest, is valued at approximately €307 million. Completion of the offer will be subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. We expect to complete the transaction in fiscal 2020.

​

Discontinued Operations

In fiscal 2019, we sold our Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business for net cash proceeds of $297 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $86 million. The SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been reported as such in all periods presented on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Results of Operations

Net Sales

The following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by segment:

The following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by segment:

Net sales decreased $540 million, or 3.9%, in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The decrease in net sales resulted from the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 3.0% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies and organic net sales declines 1.7%, partially offset by sales contributions from acquisitions of 0.8%. Price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $108 million in fiscal 2019.

See further discussion of net sales below under “Segment Results.”



Net Sales by Geographic Region.

Our business operates in three geographic regions—EMEA, Asia–Pacific, and the Americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. We sell our products into approximately 150 countries, and approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2019. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2019 by major currencies invoiced was as follows:

The following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by geographic region:

The following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by geographic region:

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin

The following table presents cost of sales and gross margin information:

In fiscal 2019, gross margin decreased $351 million as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of lower volume, unfavorable product mix, negative foreign currency translation, and price erosion, partially offset by lower material costs. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 32.7% in fiscal 2019 from 33.9% in fiscal 2018.

​



We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. Cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices which continue to fluctuate for many of the raw materials we use, including copper, gold, and silver. In fiscal 2019, we purchased approximately 172 million pounds of copper, 122,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.6 million troy ounces of silver. The following table presents the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, and silver:

​

In fiscal 2020, we expect to purchase approximately 170 million pounds of copper, 120,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.4 million troy ounces of silver.

Operating Expenses

The following table presents operating expense information:

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

In fiscal 2019, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $104 million as compared to fiscal 2018 due primarily to lower incentive compensation costs as well as cost control measures and savings attributable to restructuring actions. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.1% in fiscal 2019 from 11.4% in fiscal 2018.

Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.

We are committed to continuous productivity improvements, and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.

During fiscal 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments. During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. In connection with these initiatives, we incurred net restructuring charges of $255 million and $140 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $220 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2021. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses.

In response to market weakness in fiscal 2019, we initiated incremental restructuring actions, primarily consisting of employee severance, to broaden the scope of our cost reduction initiatives and accelerate cost reduction and factory footprint consolidation activities. We previously disclosed that we expected total restructuring charges to be approximately $375 million in fiscal 2019. We now expect certain of these actions to occur in fiscal 2020 or 2021. For fiscal 2020, we currently expect total restructuring charges to be approximately $200 million to $250 million and total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $300 million.

See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Represents the write-off of certain spare parts.

See discussion of operating income below under “Segment Results.”

Non-Operating Items

The following table presents select non-operating information:

Interest Expense.

Interest expense decreased $39 million during the fiscal 2019 due primarily to the expansion of our cross-currency swap program. Under the terms of the fiscal 2019 contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 2.9% per annum and pay no interest. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our cross-currency swap program.

Income Taxes.

See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of items impacting income tax benefit and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and 2018, including Swiss Tax Reform and the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $4,970 million and $2,191 million at fiscal year end 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

As of fiscal year end 2019, certain subsidiaries had approximately $26 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding undistributed earnings.



Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes.

During fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business for net cash proceeds of $297 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $86 million. The net sales of the business were $41 million and $702 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The results for fiscal 2019 represent one month of activity. In fiscal 2018, net sales and operating income were negatively impacted by production delays on a program. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Industry end market information is presented consistently with our internal management reporting and may be revised periodically as management deems necessary.

The following table provides an analysis of the change in the Transportation Solutions segment’s net sales by industry end market:

Net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment decreased $469 million, or 5.7%, in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 3.3% and organic net sales declines of 2.8%. Our organic net sales by industry end market were as follows:

●

Automotive

—Our organic net sales decreased 3.3% in fiscal 2019. The decrease resulted from declines of 6.4% and 3.4% in the Asia–Pacific and EMEA regions, respectively, partially offset by growth of 3.7% in the Americas region. Our declines in the Asia–Pacific and EMEA regions resulted primarily from declines in automotive production. In the Americas region, our growth was attributable to electronification and market share gains.

●

Commercial transportation

—Our organic net sales decreased 3.9% in fiscal 2019 as a result of market weakness in all regions.

●

Sensors

—Our organic net sales increased 1.4% in fiscal 2019 due primarily to growth in the industrial equipment end market.

Excluding these items, operating income decreased in fiscal 2019 due primarily to lower volume.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of $350 million of floating rate senior notes due in fiscal 2020, the pending acquisition of First Sensor, and cash spending related to restructuring initiatives. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions.

As of fiscal year end 2019, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws, substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional



tax expense. We provide for tax liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations. As of fiscal year end 2019, we had approximately $9.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA and TE Connectivity Ltd. but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to $1.0 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $153 million to $2,454 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to $2,301 million in fiscal 2018. The increase resulted primarily from higher collections of accounts receivable and fluctuations in cash collateral requirements under our cross-currency swap contracts, partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax income levels.

The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2019 and 2018 was $338 million and $393 million, respectively. We do not expect a significant change in our income tax payments as a result of Swiss Tax Reform. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Swiss Tax Reform.

Pension contributions in fiscal 2019 and 2018, were $45 million and $54 million, respectively. We expect pension contributions to be $68 million in fiscal 2020, before consideration of any voluntary contributions.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Capital expenditures were $749 million and $935 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect fiscal 2020 capital spending levels to be approximately 5-6% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.

During fiscal 2019, we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $296 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired two businesses during fiscal 2018 for a combined cash purchase price of $153 million, net of cash acquired. In fiscal 2019, we received $13 million as a result of a customary net working capital settlement for one of the acquisitions. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.

During fiscal 2019, we received net cash proceeds of $297 million related to the sale of our SubCom business. See additional information in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization

Total debt at fiscal year end 2019 and 2018 was $3,965 million and $4,000 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.

During fiscal 2019, TEGSA, our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued €350 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due June 2021. The fixed-to-floating rate senior notes bear interest at a rate of 0% until June 2020 and then at a rate of three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) plus 0.30% per year until maturity. In June 2020, we may, at our option, redeem the fixed-to-floating rate senior notes, as a whole, at 100% of the principal amount. Also, during fiscal 2019, TEGSA issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due June 2020. The floating rate senior notes bear interest at a rate of three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.45% per year. The fixed-to-floating rate senior notes and floating rate senior notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.

TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with total commitments of $1.5 billion. The Credit Facility was amended in November 2018 primarily to extend the maturity date from December 2020 to November 2023. The amended Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2019 or 2018.



The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of fiscal year end 2019, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.

Periodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility.

TEGSA’s payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.

Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were $608 million and $588 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding dividends on our common shares.

Future dividends on our common shares, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant.

In both fiscal 2019 and 2018, our board of directors authorized increases of $1.5 billion in our share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately 12 million of our common shares for $1,014 million and approximately 10 million of our common shares for $966 million under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. At fiscal year end 2019, we had $1.5 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.

Commitments and Contingencies

The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other obligations at fiscal year end 2019:

(1)

Debt represents principal payments. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.

(2)

Interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts. Interest payments on debt are projected for future periods using rates in effect as of fiscal year end 2019 and are subject to change in future periods.

(3)

See “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our adoption of Accounting Standards Codifications (“ASC”) 842,

Leases,

in fiscal 2020.

(4)

Purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services.

(5)

The above table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of $542 million and related accrued interest and penalties of $42 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits, interest, and penalties.



(6)

The above table does not reflect pension obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $68 million to pension plans in fiscal 2020, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments.

(7)

Other long-term liabilities of $427 million are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items.

Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2020 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At fiscal year end 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $309 million.

As discussed above, in fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale. These guarantees had a combined value of approximately $1.55 billion as of fiscal year end 2019 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire by fiscal year end 2020. Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years. At fiscal year end 2019, there were no such new performance guarantees outstanding. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the SubCom business.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management’s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

​



Revenue Recognition

We account for revenue in accordance with ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control. We transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers, the customers accept and have legal title for the product, and we have a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. Our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of fiscal year end 2019.

We generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations.

Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us.

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our adoption of ASC 606 in fiscal 2019.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, and customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant.

We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (a “component”) if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2019, we had five reporting units, all of which contained goodwill. There were two reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and one reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure.

Goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on several reporting unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis.



When testing for goodwill impairment, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Fair value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.

We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and determined that no impairment existed.

Income Taxes

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of pre-tax operating income in various tax jurisdictions, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.

Changes in tax laws and rates, including Swiss Tax Reform, also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Swiss Tax Reform. Management is not aware of any other such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Pension

Our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants, or, for inactive plans, over the remaining life expectancy of participants.

Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2019, a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $150 million; a 25-basis-point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by $131 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50-basis-point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2019 pension expense by $11 million.

At fiscal year end 2019, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans’ master trust is 5% return-seeking assets and 95% liability-hedging assets. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 115%. Based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2019, our target asset allocation is 67% return-seeking and 33% liability-hedging.

Accounting Pronouncements

Non-GAAP Financial Measure

Organic Net Sales Growth

We present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.

Organic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in “Results of Operations” and “Segment Results” provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP.



Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.

ITEM

7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements. We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks.

We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 credit rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty.

Foreign Currency Exposures

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. In addition, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our cross-currency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2019 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by $282 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our cross-currency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2018 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by $101 million. Such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions.

Interest Rate and Investment Exposures

We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To manage the interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. We may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt. We also utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities.

Based on our floating rate debt balances at fiscal year end 2019 and 2018, a 50-basis-point increase in the levels of the U.S. dollar interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in an immaterial increase in interest expense in both fiscal 2019 and 2018.

​



Commodity Exposures

Our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges. We continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period. At fiscal year end 2019, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, and copper, were in a net gain position of $1 million and had a notional value of $316 million. At fiscal year end 2018, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, and copper, were in a net loss position of $34 million and had a notional value of $401 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold, a troy ounce of silver, and a pound of copper, from the fiscal year end 2019 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $32 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold, a troy ounce of silver, and a pound of copper, from the fiscal year end 2018 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $37 million.

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

​

​

​



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of TE Connectivity Ltd.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 27, 2019 and September 28, 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2019, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 27, 2019 and September 28, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 12, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Goodwill —Transportation Solutions Reportable Segment — Refer to Notes 2 and 8 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves

comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever the Company believes a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred

. The Company uses the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows to estimate fair value. The income approach is supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. The goodwill balance was $5.7 billion as of September 27, 2019, of which $1.1 billion was allocated to a reporting unit within the Transportation Solutions reportable segment. The fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized.



We identified goodwill for this reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate its fair value, especially considering future growth rates were based on an expectation of an increase in net sales in a product portfolio with limited historical operating results and limited available third-party industry reports. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margin and the selection of a discount rate.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenue and operating margin (the “forecasts”), and the selection of a discount rate for a reporting unit within the Transportation Solutions reportable segment included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value, such as controls related to forecasts and management’s selection of the discount rate.

•

We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and operating margin by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.

•

We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to:

−

Historical operating results of the reporting unit.

−

Historical operating results of the Company’s other reporting units.

−

Internal communications to management and the board of directors.

−

External communications made by management to analysts and investors.

−

Third-party industry reports for similar products.

●

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate by:

–

Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.

−

Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.

Income Taxes — Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets — Refer to Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company recognizes deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to expiration. Sources of taxable income include future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities, expected future taxable income, taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted under the tax law, and tax planning strategies. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize a portion of its deferred tax assets, and therefore, a valuation allowance of $5.0 billion has been recorded to offset the Company’s gross deferred tax assets as of September 27, 2019 of $7.7 billion.

We identified the realizability of deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter because of the Company’s tax structure and the significant judgments and estimates made by management to determine that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future prior to expiration to realize a portion of its deferred tax assets. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of qualifying tax planning strategies and the reasonableness of management’s estimates of taxable income prior to expiration.

​



How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the determination that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize deferred tax assets included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s estimates of the realization of the deferred tax assets, including those over the estimates of taxable income, the approval of tax planning strategies and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized prior to expiration.

•

We evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate taxable income by comparing actual results to management’s historical estimates and evaluating whether there have been any changes that would impact management’s ability to continue accurately estimating taxable income.

•

We tested the reasonableness of management’s estimates of taxable income by comparing the estimates to:

–

Historical taxable income.

–

Internal communications and the Company’s strategic plan approved by management and the board of directors.

–

Management’s history of carrying out its stated plans and its ability to carry out its plans considering contractual commitments, available financing, or debt covenants.

●

We evaluated whether the estimates of future taxable income were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

●

We evaluated whether the taxable income in prior carryback years was of the appropriate character and available under the tax law.

•

With the assistance of our income tax specialists, we evaluated (1) the appropriateness of qualifying tax planning strategies, including that they were prudent, feasible and would more likely than not result in the realization of deferred tax assets and (2) management’s assessment that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize a portion of the deferred tax assets prior to expiration.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of TE Connectivity Ltd.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 27, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2019, of the Company and our report dated November 12, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of TE Connectivity Ltd. and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in United States (“U.S.”) dollars in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).

Description of the Business

TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity” or the “Company,” which may be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a global industrial technology leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. Our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, enable advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home.

We operate through

three

reportable segments:

●

Transportation Solutions

—The Transportation Solutions segment is a leader in connectivity and sensor technologies. Our products, which must withstand harsh conditions, are used in the automotive, commercial transportation, and sensors markets.

●

Industrial Solutions

—The Industrial Solutions segment is a leading supplier of products that connect and distribute power, data, and signals. Our products are used in the industrial equipment; aerospace, defense, oil, and gas; and energy markets.

●

Communications Solutions

—The Communications Solutions segment is a leading supplier of electronic components for the data and devices and the appliances markets.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Fiscal Year

We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday of September. Fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were 52 weeks in length and ended on September 27, 2019, September 28, 2018, and September 29, 2017, respectively. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period includes 14 weeks, with the next such occurrence taking place in fiscal 2022.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

We consolidate entities in which we own or control more than


% of the voting shares or otherwise control through similar rights. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included on the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.

Revenue Recognition

We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, which introduced a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control. We transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers, the customers accept and have legal title for the



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

product, and we have a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. Our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of fiscal year end 2019. See Note 20 for net sales disaggregated by industry end market and geographic region which is summarized by segment and that we consider meaningful to depict the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows affected by economic factors.

We generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations.

Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out cost method.

Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net

Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense when incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are


to

20 years

for land improvements,


to

40 years

for buildings and improvements, and


to

15 years

for machinery and equipment.

We periodically evaluate, when events and circumstances warrant, the net realizable value of property, plant, and equipment and other long-lived assets, relying on several factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the asset group are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying asset group. Impairment of the carrying value is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying value of the asset. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, and customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from


to

50 years

and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

At fiscal year end 2019, we had

five

reporting units, all of which contained goodwill. There were

two

reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and

one

reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.

Goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on several reporting unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis.

When testing for goodwill impairment, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Fair value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in research, development, and engineering expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred, and building and overhead expenses. The amounts expensed in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $


million, $


million, and $


million, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss carryforwards using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest.

Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt, and derivative financial instruments.

​

We account for derivative financial instrument contracts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. For instruments not designated as hedges under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, the changes in the instruments’ fair value are recognized currently in earnings. For instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged item affects earnings. Amounts excluded from the hedging relationship are recognized currently in earnings. Changes in the fair value of instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or liability hedged, with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability being recognized currently in earnings.

We determine the fair value of our financial instruments by using methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. Standard market conventions are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, including derivatives.

The cash flows related to derivative financial instruments are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Our derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks. Concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated, however, by our use of financial institutions worldwide, substantially all of which have long-term Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and/or Fitch credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, we utilize only conventional derivative financial instruments. We are exposed to potential losses if a counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of its agreement. With respect to counterparty net asset positions recognized at fiscal year end 2019, we have assessed the likelihood of counterparty default as remote. We currently provide guarantees from a wholly-owned subsidiary to the counterparties to our commodity swap derivatives and exchange cash collateral with the counterparties to certain of our cross-currency swap contracts. The likelihood of performance on the guarantees has been assessed as remote. For all other derivative financial instruments, we are not required to provide, nor do we require counterparties to provide, collateral or other security.

Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

, specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observable inputs utilized in valuation of certain assets and liabilities. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. Fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:

●

Level 1—

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

●

Level 2—

Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

●

Level 3—

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flows methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

Derivative financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are generally valued using level 2 inputs.

​



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Financial instruments other than derivative instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. These instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at book value. For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, we believe book value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. See Note 11 for disclosure of the fair value of debt. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial instruments:

●

Cash and cash equivalents—

Cash and cash equivalents are valued at book value, which we consider to be equivalent to unadjusted quoted prices (level 1).

●

Accounts receivable—

Accounts receivable are valued based on the net value expected to be realized. The net realizable value generally represents an observable contractual agreement (level 2).

●

Accounts payable—

Accounts payable are valued based on the net value expected to be paid, generally supported by an observable contractual agreement (level 2).

●

Debt—

The fair value of debt, including both current and non-current maturities, is derived from quoted market prices or other pricing determinations based on the results of market approach valuation models using observable market data such as recently reported trades, bid and offer information, and benchmark securities (level 2).

Pension

The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants, or, for inactive plans, over the remaining life expectancy of participants.

The measurement of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on estimates and assumptions determined by our management. These valuations reflect the terms of the plans and use participant-specific information such as compensation, age, and years of service, as well as certain assumptions, including estimates of discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, interest crediting rates, and mortality rates.

Share-Based Compensation

We determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant. Share options are valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model; restricted share awards and performance awards are valued using our end-of-day share price on the date of grant. The fair value is expensed ratably over the expected service period, with an allowance made for estimated forfeitures based on historical employee activity. Estimates regarding the attainment of performance criteria are reviewed periodically; the cumulative impact of a change in estimate regarding the attainment of performance criteria is recorded in the period in which that change is made.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation arrangements.

Currency Translation

For our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using fiscal year end exchange rates. Sales and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings.

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring activities involve employee-related termination costs, facility exit costs, and asset impairments resulting from reductions-in-force, migration of facilities or product lines from higher-cost to lower-cost countries, or consolidation of facilities within countries. We recognize termination costs based on requirements established by severance policy, government law, or previous actions. Facility exit costs generally reflect the cost to terminate a facility lease before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time we cease using the facility) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the facility lease without future economic benefit to us. Restructuring activities often result in the disposal or abandonment of assets that require an acceleration of depreciation or impairment reflecting the excess of the assets’ carrying values over fair value.

The recognition of restructuring costs require that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing, and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity. To the extent our actual results differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimated liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring costs or the reduction of liabilities already recognized. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure these balances are properly stated and the utilization of the reserves are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.

Contingent Liabilities

We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists, we record the low end of the range. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. In addition, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of that loss can be made. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a loss is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02 which codified ASC 842,

Leases

. This guidance, as subsequently amended, requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for most leases and is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2019, we substantially completed the process of updating policies, internal controls, financial statement disclosures, and systems to incorporate the impact of the new standard in our financial reporting processes. In fiscal 2020, we are adopting the standard using the optional transition method permitted by ASU No. 2018-11, which allows for application of the standard at the adoption date and no restatement of comparative periods. We plan to elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows for the carry forward of historical lease classification of existing and expired leases. We expect to record right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities of approximately $


million on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adoption will not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, an update to ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

. The update improves and simplifies hedge accounting and related disclosures. We elected to early adopt this update, which did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, in fiscal 2019.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, an update to ASC 740,

Income Taxes

. This guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs. The update was adopted on a modified retrospective basis in fiscal 2019 and resulted in a $


million cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings, which represented the net reversal of all balances associated with deferred tax impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This included a decrease in other assets of $


million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $


million, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $


million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 which codified ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

. This guidance supersedes ASC 605,

Revenue Recognition

, and introduces a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. ASC 606 also enhances disclosures related to revenue recognition. We adopted ASC 606, as amended, in fiscal 2019 using a modified retrospective approach. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Transition impacts, which relate primarily to incentive compensation arrangements, were not material to our results of operations or financial position. Because the impact of adoption was immaterial, we have not recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings.

Fiscal 2019 Actions

During fiscal 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments. In connection with this program, during fiscal 2019, we recorded net restructuring charges of $


million. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2019 by the end of fiscal 2021 and to incur additional charges of approximately $


million related primarily to employee severance and facility exit costs in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments.

The following table summarizes expected, incurred, and remaining charges for the fiscal 2019 program by segment:

​

Fiscal 2018 Actions

During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. In connection with this program, during fiscal 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $

4. Discontinued Operations

In fiscal 2019, we sold our Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business for net cash proceeds of $


million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $


million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses of $


million and the guarantee liabilities discussed below. The definitive agreement provided that, if the purchaser sells the business within

two years

of the closing date, we will be entitled to


% of the net proceeds of that future sale, as defined in the agreement, in excess of $


million. The sale of the SubCom business, which was previously included in our Communications Solutions segment, represents our exit from the telecommunications market and was significant to our sales and profitability, both to the Communications Solutions segment and to the consolidated company. We concluded that the divestiture was a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. As a result, the SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been reported as such in all periods presented on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Upon entering into the definitive agreement, which we consider a level 2 observable input in the fair value hierarchy, we assessed the carrying value of the SubCom business and determined that it was in excess of its fair value. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $


million, which was included in income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to write the carrying value of the business down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.

In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale. These guarantees had a combined value of approximately $

1.55

billion as of fiscal year end 2019 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire by fiscal year end 2020. At the time of sale, we determined that the fair value of these guarantees was $


million, which we recognized by a charge to pre-tax loss on sale. Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $


million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to

three years

. At fiscal year end 2019, there were

no

such new performance guarantees outstanding. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform.

The following table presents the summarized components of income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for the SubCom business and prior divestitures:

​

(1)

Included a

$


million impairment charge recorded in connection with the sale of our SubCom business.

%

until June 2020 and then at a rate of

three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate

(“EURIBOR”) plus

0.30

%

per year until maturity.

During fiscal 2019, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our


%-owned subsidiary, issued €


million aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due June 2021. In June 2020, we may, at our option, redeem the fixed-to-floating rate senior notes, as a whole, at


% of the principal amount. Also, during fiscal 2019, TEGSA issued $


million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due June 2020. The fixed-to-floating rate senior notes and floating rate senior notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.

TEGSA has a

five-year

unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with total commitments of $

1.5

billion. The Credit Facility was amended in November 2018 primarily to extend the maturity date from December 2020 to November 2023. The amended Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $


million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had

no

borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2019 or 2018.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Bank of America, N.A.’s base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus


/


of 1%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus


%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from

5.0

to

12.5

basis points based upon the amount of the lenders’ commitments under the Credit Facility and the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA.

​



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of

four

consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants.

Periodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility.

12. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Environmental Matters

We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. As of fiscal year end 2019, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $


million to $


million, and we accrued $


million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Guarantees

In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At fiscal year end 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $


million.

We sold our SubCom business during fiscal 2019. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to honor certain performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business. See Note 4 for additional information regarding these guarantees and the divestiture of the SubCom business.

13. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements

We use derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, investment, and commodity risks.

The effects of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were immaterial for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. We expect that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with the cash flow hedge-designated instruments addressing foreign exchange risks will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statement of Operations within the next

twelve months

.

During fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of €

1,000

million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make interest payments in euros at

3.50

% per annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of

5.33

% per annum. Upon the maturity of these



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

contracts in fiscal 2022, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. In connection with the cross-currency swap contracts, both counterparties to each contract are required to provide cash collateral.

At fiscal year end 2019, these cross-currency swap contracts were in an asset position of $


million and were recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The cross-currency swap contracts were in a liability position of $


million and were recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fiscal year end 2018. At fiscal year end 2019 and 2018, collateral received from or paid to our counterparties approximated the derivative positions and was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities (when the contracts are in an asset position) or prepaid expenses and other current assets (when the contracts are in a liability position) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The impacts of these cross-currency swap contracts were as follows:

​

(1)

Gains and losses excluded from the hedging relationship are recognized prospectively in selling, general, and administrative expenses and are offset by losses and gains generated as a result of re-measuring certain intercompany loans to the U.S. dollar.

Hedge of Net Investment

We hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany loans and external borrowings denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $

3,374

million and $

4,064

million at fiscal year end 2019 and 2018, respectively.

During fiscal 2019, we expanded our cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of the fiscal 2019 contracts was $

1,844

million at fiscal year end 2019. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of

2.9

% per annum and pay

no

interest. Upon the maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2023, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currency and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. We are not required to provide collateral for these contracts.

The impacts of our hedge of net investment programs were as follows:

​

(1)

Foreign currency exchange gains and losses on intercompany loans and external borrowings are recorded as currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and are offset by changes attributable to the translation of the net investment.

(2)

Gains and losses on cross-currency swap contracts designated as hedges of net investment are recorded as currency translation.

Interest Rate and Investment Risk Management

We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To manage the interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. We may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt. We also utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities.

Commodity Hedges

As part of managing the exposure to certain commodity price fluctuations, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in prices of commodities used in production.

At fiscal year end 2019 and 2018, our commodity hedges had notional values of $


million and $


million, respectively. We expect that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with the commodity hedges will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statement of Operations within the next

twelve months

.

Fair Value Measurements

Financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, which consist of derivative instruments and marketable securities, were immaterial at fiscal year end 2019 and 2018.

14. Retirement Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

We have several contributory and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of our non-U.S. and U.S. employees, designed in accordance with local customs and practice.

The net periodic pension benefit cost for all non-U.S. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans was as follows:

The pre-tax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for all non-U.S. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans were as follows:

​

​

In fiscal 2019, unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were primarily the result of lower discount rates, partially offset by favorable asset performance for both non-U.S. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans as compared to fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2018, unrecognized actuarial gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were primarily the result of higher discount rates and favorable asset performance for both non-U.S. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans as compared to fiscal 2017.

The estimated amortization of actuarial losses from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic pension benefit cost for non-U.S. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2020 is expected to be $


million and $


million, respectively. The estimated amortization of prior service credit from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic pension benefit cost for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2020 is expected to be $


million.

In determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations.

The investment strategies for non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans are governed locally. Our investment strategy for our pension plans is to manage the plans on a going concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. Projected returns are based primarily on pro forma asset allocation, expected long-term returns, and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management.

At fiscal year end 2019, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans’ master trust is


% return-seeking assets and


% liability-hedging assets. Return-seeking assets, including non-U.S. and U.S. equity securities, are assets intended to generate returns in excess of pension liability growth. Liability-hedging assets, including government and corporate bonds, are assets intended to have characteristics similar to pension liabilities and are used to better match asset cash flows with expected obligation cash flows. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds


%. Based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2019, our target asset allocation is


% return-seeking and


% liability-hedging.

Target weighted-average asset allocation and weighted-average asset allocation for non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans were as follows:

​

​

Our common shares are not a direct investment of our pension funds; however, the pension funds may indirectly include our shares. The aggregate amount of our common shares would not be considered material relative to the total pension fund assets.

Our funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which we operate as well as to make discretionary voluntary contributions from time to time. We expect to make the minimum required contributions of $


million and $


million to our non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans, respectively, in fiscal 2020. We may also make voluntary contributions at our discretion.

At fiscal year end 2019, benefit payments, which reflect future expected service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

​

We value our pension assets based on the fair value hierarchy of ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

. Details of the fair value hierarchy are described in Note 2. The following table presents our defined benefit pension plans’ asset categories and their associated fair value within the fair value hierarchy:

​

​

(1)

Commingled equity funds are pooled investments in multiple equity-type securities. Fair value is calculated as the closing price of the underlying investments, an observable market condition, divided by the number of shares of the fund outstanding.

(2)

Government bonds are marked to fair value based on quoted market prices or market approach valuation models using observable market data such as quotes, spreads, and data points for yield curves.

(3)

Corporate bonds are marked to fair value based on quoted market prices or market approach valuation models using observable market data such as quotes, spreads, and data points for yield curves.

(4)

Commingled bond funds are pooled investments in multiple debt-type securities. Fair value is calculated as the closing price of the underlying investments, an observable market condition, divided by the number of shares of the fund outstanding.

(5)

Other investments are composed of insurance contracts, derivatives, short-term investments, structured products such as collateralized obligations and mortgage- and asset-backed securities, real estate investments, and hedge funds. Insurance contracts are valued using cash surrender value, or face value of the contract if a cash surrender value is unavailable (level 2), as these values represent the amount that the plan would receive on termination of the underlying contract. Derivatives, short-term investments, and structured products are marked to fair value using models that are supported by observable market-based data (level 2). Real estate investments include investments in commingled real estate funds and are valued at net asset value which is calculated using unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity (level 3). Hedge funds are valued at their net asset value which is calculated using unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity (level 3).

Items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include amounts receivable for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased, and any cash balances, considered to be carried at book value, that are held in the plans.

(7)

Non-U.S. and U.S. equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded.

Changes in Level 3 assets in non-U.S. plans were primarily the result of purchases in fiscal 2019 and 2018.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

We maintain several defined contribution retirement plans, the most significant of which is located in the U.S. These plans include 401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants’ compensation and was $


million, $


million, and $


million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans

We maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds correspond to several funds in our 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. At fiscal year end 2019 and 2018, total deferred compensation liabilities were $


million and $


million, respectively, and were recorded primarily in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 13 for additional information regarding our risk management strategy related to deferred compensation liabilities.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension and 401(k) benefits, we also provide certain health care coverage continuation for qualifying retirees from the date of retirement to age 65. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was $


million at fiscal year end 2019 and 2018, and the underfunded status of the postretirement benefit plans was included primarily in long-term pension and postretirement liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Activity during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was not significant.

Excludes items which are separately presented.

The income tax benefit for fiscal 2019 included a $

million income tax benefit related to the effective settlement of a tax audit in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, and $


million of income tax expense associated with the tax impacts of certain legal entity restructurings and intercompany transactions. See “Swiss Tax Reform” below for additional information regarding Swiss Tax Reform.

The income tax benefit for fiscal 2018 included a $

1,222

million net income tax benefit associated with the tax impacts of certain legal entity restructurings and intercompany transactions that occurred in the quarter ended September 28, 2018. The net income tax benefit of $

1,222

million related primarily to the recognition of certain non-U.S. loss carryforwards and basis differences in subsidiaries expected to be utilized against future taxable income, partially offset by a $


million increase in the valuation allowance for certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards. The income tax benefit for fiscal 2018 also included $


million of income tax expense related to the tax impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) and a $


million net income tax benefit related to the tax impacts of certain legal entity restructurings that occurred in the quarter ended December 29, 2017. See “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” below for additional information regarding the Act.

The income tax expense for fiscal 2017 included a $


million income tax benefit associated with the tax impacts of certain intercompany transactions and the corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance for U.S. tax loss carryforwards, a $


million income tax benefit related to share-based payments and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, and a $


million income tax benefit associated with pre-separation tax matters.

​

​

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $

4,970

million and $

2,191

million at fiscal year end 2019 and 2018, respectively, related principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. During fiscal 2019, tax loss and carryforwards increased



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

primarily as a result of a $

2,891

million (tax effected) net write-down of investments in subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions, offset by a corresponding increase to the valuation allowance. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries’ earnings that are expected to be distributed in the future. No additional provision has been made for Swiss or non-Swiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of fiscal year end 2019, certain subsidiaries had approximately $


billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. As of fiscal year end 2019, we had approximately $

9.1

billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to $

1.0

billion of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.

Uncertain Tax Positions

As of fiscal year end 2019, we had total unrecognized income tax benefits of $


million. If recognized in future years, $


million of these currently unrecognized income tax benefits would impact income tax expense (benefit) and the effective tax rate. As of fiscal year end 2018, we had total unrecognized income tax benefits of $


million. If recognized in future years, $


million of these currently unrecognized income tax benefits would impact income tax expense (benefit) and the effective tax rate. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized income tax benefits:

​

​

We record accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense (benefit). As of fiscal year end 2019 and 2018, we had $


million and $


million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recorded primarily in income taxes. During fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recognized income tax benefits of $


million, expense of $


million, and benefits of $


million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We file income tax returns on a unitary, consolidated, or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions, which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to

4 years

. Various state and local income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Our non-U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns in the countries in which they have operations. Generally, these countries have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to

. Various non-U.S. subsidiary income tax returns are currently in the process of examination by taxing authorities.

As of fiscal year end 2019, under applicable statutes, the following tax years remained subject to examination in the major tax jurisdictions indicated:

​

​

In most jurisdictions, taxing authorities retain the ability to review prior tax years and to adjust any net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from these years that are utilized in a subsequent period.

Although it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that approximately $


million of unrecognized income tax benefits, excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months.

We are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of fiscal year end 2019.

Other Income Tax Matters

Swiss Tax Reform

Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in September 2018, and it was approved by public vote on May 19, 2019. Swiss Tax Reform eliminates certain preferential tax items and implements new tax rates at both the federal and cantonal levels.

Subsequent to the public approval of Swiss Tax Reform, on May 24, 2019, the federal tax authority issued guidance abolishing certain interest deductions effective January 1, 2020. The federal provisions of Swiss Tax Reform were enacted into law in the quarter ended September 27, 2019. Based on our forecast of taxable income and the abolishment of certain interest deductions, we believe it is more likely than not that additional deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards in Switzerland will be realized in the future. As a result, during fiscal 2019, we recorded a $


million income tax benefit related primarily to the reduction to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets

In October 2019, the canton of Schaffhausen enacted Swiss Tax Reform into law. We are currently assessing the impacts of the cantonal implementation, including reductions in tax rates.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, included numerous significant changes to existing tax law, including a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to


%, effective January 1, 2018; further limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation; repeal of the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax; and imposition of a territorial tax system with a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In the period of enactment, we revalued our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the


% tax rate and recorded income tax expense of $


million primarily in connection with the write-down of our U.S. federal deferred tax asset for net operating loss and interest carryforwards to the lower tax rate. Included in the expense of $


million was an income tax benefit of $


million related to the reduction in the existing valuation allowance recorded against certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards.

Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. We have substantially settled all U.S. federal income tax matters with the IRS for periods covered under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Certain shared U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax matters remain open. We do not expect these matters will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

with residual activity recorded against accumulated earnings as reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity. To the extent that the contributed surplus balance continues to be zero, the impact of future transactions that normally would have been recorded as a reduction of contributed surplus will be recorded in accumulated earnings. Contributed surplus established for Swiss tax and statutory purposes (“Swiss Contributed Surplus”) is not impacted by our GAAP treatment.

Restricted share awards, which are generally in the form of restricted share units, are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. All restrictions on an award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies retirement requirements, a portion of the award may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Recipients of restricted share units have no voting rights, but do receive dividend equivalents. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on the closing value of our shares on the grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest in increments over a period of

four years

as determined by the management development and compensation committee.

Performance Share Awards

Performance share awards, which are generally in the form of performance share units, are granted with pay-out subject to vesting requirements and certain performance conditions that are determined at the time of grant. Based on our performance, the pay-out of performance share units can range from


% to


% of the number of units originally granted. The grant-date fair value of performance share awards is expensed over the period of performance once achievement of the performance criteria is deemed probable. Recipients of performance share units have no voting rights but do receive dividend equivalents. Performance share awards generally vest after a period of

three years

as determined by the management development and compensation committee.

Share Options

Share options are granted to purchase our common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies retirement requirements, a portion of the award may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Options generally vest and become exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of

four years

Share-Based Compensation Assumptions

The grant-date fair value of each share option grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. We employ our historical share volatility when calculating the grant-date fair value of our share option grants using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Currently, we do not have exchange-traded options of sufficient duration to employ an implied volatility assumption in the calculation and therefore rely solely on the historical volatility calculation. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term that approximated the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share was based on our expected dividend rate. The recognized share-based compensation expense was net of estimated forfeitures, which are based on voluntary termination behavior as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted and the weighted-average assumptions we used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model were as follows:

20. Segment and Geographic Data

We operate through

three

reportable segments: Transportation Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Communications Solutions. See Note 1 for a description of the segments in which we operate.

Segment performance is evaluated based on net sales and operating income. Generally, we consider all expenses to be of an operating nature and, accordingly, allocate them to each reportable segment. Costs specific to a segment are charged to the segment. Corporate expenses, such as headquarters administrative costs, are allocated to the segments based on segment operating income. Intersegment sales were not material and were recorded at selling prices that approximated market prices. Corporate assets are allocated to the segments based on segment assets.
