PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("we," "Tyco Electronics," or the "Company") is a leading global provider of engineered electronic
components, network solutions, specialty products, and subsea communication systems. We design, manufacture, and market products for customers in a broad array of industries including automotive; data
communications equipment and consumer electronics; telecommunications; aerospace, defense, and marine; medical; energy; and lighting. Our products are produced in approximately 90 manufacturing sites
in over 20 countries. With approximately 7,000 engineers and worldwide manufacturing, sales, and customer service capabilities, Tyco Electronics' commitment is our customers' advantage.

Tyco
Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of then Bermuda-based Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). For the
period following its incorporation, Tyco Electronics Ltd. did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal assets. Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco International
distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics to its common shareholders (referred to in this report as the "separation"). Tyco Electronics Ltd. became an independent, publicly traded
company owning the former electronics businesses of Tyco International.

Our
business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions, from fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2002, of established electronics companies and divisions, including the acquisition
of AMP Incorporated and Raychem Corporation in fiscal 1999 and the Electromechanical Components Division of Siemens and OEM Division of Thomas & Betts in fiscal 2000. These companies each have
more than 50 years of history in engineering and innovation excellence. We operated as a segment of Tyco International prior to our separation.

Effective
June 25, 2009, we discontinued our existence as a Bermuda company as provided in Section 132G of The Companies Act of 1981 of Bermuda, as amended (the "Bermuda
Companies Act"), and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued our existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of
the Swiss Code of Obligations. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations.

We
operate through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Specialty Products, and Subsea Communications. See Notes 1 and 24 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments.



Our
reporting segments manufacture and distribute our products and solutions to a number of end markets. The table below provides a summary of our reporting segments, the fiscal 2010 net

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:

•

Portfolio of market-leading connectivity businesses.

We
are leaders in many of the markets we serve, and the opportunity for growth in those markets is significant. We believe our four segments serve a combined $70 billion market that is expected to
grow to $100 billion in the next five years.

•

Global leader in passive components.

With net sales of
approximately $12.1 billion in fiscal 2010, we are significantly larger than many of our competitors. In the fragmented connector industry, which we estimated to be $42 billion in fiscal
2010, our net sales were approximately $8 billion. We have established a global leadership position in the connector industry with leading market positions in the following
markets:

•

Automotive—#1

•

Industrial—#1

•

Telecom/data communications—#3

•

Computers and peripherals—#4

Our
scale provides us the opportunity to accelerate our sales growth by making larger investments in existing and new technologies in our core markets and to expand our presence in emerging markets.
Our leadership position also provides us the opportunity to lower our purchasing costs by developing lower cost sources of supply and to maintain a flexible manufacturing footprint worldwide that is
close to our customers' locations.

•

Strong customer relationships.

As an industry leader, we
have established close working relationships with our customers. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical
solutions. By working with



our
customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we are able to identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products.

•

Process and product technology leadership.

We employ
approximately 7,000 engineers dedicated to product research, development, and engineering. Our investment of $585 million in product and process engineering and development together with our
capital spending of $385 million in fiscal 2010, enable us to consistently provide innovative, high-quality products with efficient manufacturing methods.

•

Diverse product mix and customer base.

We manufacture and
sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back
many years. We believe that this diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduces our exposure to particular end markets, thereby
reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our
competitors.

•

Balanced geographic sales mix.

We have an established
manufacturing presence in over 20 countries and our sales are global. Our global coverage positions us near our customers' locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and
lowering their production costs. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile.

•

Strong and experienced management team.

We believe we have
a management team that has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our Chief Executive Officer and segment leaders average more
than 20 years of experience of which most is in the electronics industry. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team that is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our
position as a global leader in the industry.

Our Strategy

Our goal is to be the world leader in providing custom-engineered electronic components and solutions for an increasingly connected
world. We believe that in achieving this, we will increase net sales and profitability across our segments in the markets that we serve. Our business strategy is based upon the following
priorities:

•

Deliver extraordinary customer service.

We are broadening
the concept of service to embrace every aspect of how we reach and serve our customers. We are increasing our focus on our strategic accounts through direct sales, better leveraging the distribution
channel, and revolutionizing our web presence and eBusiness programs. These initiatives, along with our company-wide improvement program designed to improve productivity, reduce costs, and
ultimately deliver greater satisfaction to our customers and greater value to shareholders, will enable us to broaden our customer reach and increase customer satisfaction while enabling us to serve
customers better and more cost effectively.

•

Strengthen our innovation leadership.

Technology
leadership is critical to our business. We seek to continue to strengthen our process and product technology leadership and to increase the percentage of our annual net sales from new products. In
fiscal 2010, we derived approximately 26% of our net sales from new products launched within the previous three years. In order to accomplish this goal, we intend to focus our research, development,
and engineering investment on next generation technologies and highly engineered products and platforms, and leverage innovation across our segments.



•

Achieve market leadership in attractive and under-penetrated
industries.

We plan to accelerate growth in end-user markets in which we do not have the number one market share but which
we believe have attractive growth and profitability characteristics. These markets include: the alternate energy and lighting markets with respect to our Electronic Components segment; the energy,
communication service providers, and enterprise networks markets with respect to our Network Solutions segment; and the aerospace, defense, and marine, touch systems, and medical markets with respect
to our Specialty Products segment. We believe that we can further leverage our customer service and our new product and technology capabilities in order to achieve a leading position in these markets.

•

Extend our leadership in emerging markets.

We seek to
improve our market leadership position in emerging geographic regions, including China, Eastern Europe, Brazil, and India, which we expect will experience higher growth rates than those of more
developed regions in the world. In fiscal 2010, we generated $1.9 billion of net sales in China, $0.9 billion of net sales in Eastern Europe, $0.3 billion of net sales in Brazil,
and $0.2 billion of net sales in India. We believe that expansion in these regions will enable us to grow faster than the overall global market.

•

Supplement organic growth with strategic partnerships and
acquisitions.

We will evaluate and selectively pursue strategic partnerships and acquisitions that strengthen our market position,
enhance our existing product offering, enable us to enter attractive markets, expand our technological capabilities, and provide synergy opportunities.

We
own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and
trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is
obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.

While
we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that our operations
are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

Employees

As of September 24, 2010, we employed approximately 89,000 people worldwide, of whom 23,000 were in the Americas region, 25,000
were in the Europe/Middle East/Africa region, and 41,000 were in


the
Asia-Pacific region. Of our total employees, approximately 55,000 were employed in manufacturing and 22,000 were represented by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 64% of
our employees were based in lower-cost countries, primarily China. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

Government Regulation and Supervision

The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the United States and other countries. A small portion of our products,
including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and
other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import
and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.

Environmental

Our operations are subject to numerous health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations that have
been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the
protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate
policies and standards, staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues, periodic compliance auditing, training, and other measures. We have a program for compliance with the European
Union ("EU") Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronics Equipment Directives, the China Restriction of Hazardous Substances law, and similar laws.

Compliance
with these laws has in the past and may in the future increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways. For example, our costs may increase indirectly through
increased energy and product costs as producers of energy, cement, iron, steel, pulp, paper, petroleum, and other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to increased or new regulation or
legislation that results in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate
environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, current information, and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the
range of approximately $14 million to $24 million. As of September 24, 2010, we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately $14 million. We do not
anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks described
below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to risks that affect many other companies, such as general economic conditions, geopolitical events, competition, technological
obsolescence, labor relations, natural disasters, and international operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business
operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Risks Relating to Our Business

Conditions in global or regional economies, capital and money markets, and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or worldwide, including
the cost and availability of consumer and business credit, end demand from consumer and industrial markets, and concerns as to sovereign debt levels, any of which could cause our customers to
experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow, and ability to obtain financing. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be
able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full. Further, our vendors may experience similar problems, which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed
service and quality levels. If regional or global economic conditions deteriorate, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

We
are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products, and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets. Our sales are dependent
on certain end markets that are impacted by consumer, industrial, and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets. For example, the
automotive industry, which accounted for approximately 35% of our net sales in fiscal 2010, is still below fiscal 2008 levels as described below. The telecommunications industry, which accounted for
approximately 16% of our net sales in fiscal 2010, has historically experienced periods of robust capital expenditure followed by periods of retrenchment and consolidation. The aerospace, defense, and
marine industry, which accounted for 5% of our net sales in fiscal 2010, has undergone significant fluctuations in demand, depending on worldwide economic and political conditions. Periodic downturns
in our customers' industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are dependent on the automotive industry which experienced significant declines in the recent economic environment.

Approximately 35% of our net sales for fiscal 2010 were to customers in the automotive industry. Automotive manufacturers globally have
experienced significantly lower levels of vehicle sales as a result of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn and credit conditions. Although sales have increased during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal
2009 levels, sales still remain below fiscal 2008 levels. Additionally, the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers. As a
supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by changes in the operations, products, business
models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automotive manufacturers, as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers.


We are dependent on the telecommunications, computer, and consumer electronics industries.

Approximately 16% of our net sales for fiscal 2010 came from sales to the telecommunications industry. Demand for these products is
subject to rapid technological change, and was and remains affected by declines in consumer and business spending. Additionally, these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers that can
exert significant price pressure on their suppliers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in the telecommunications industry, and our inability to do so
would materially impair our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Approximately
9% of our net sales for fiscal 2010 came from sales to the computer and consumer electronics industries. Demand for our computer and consumer electronics products depends
on underlying business and consumer demand for computer and consumer electronics products, as well as the market share of our customers. Demand was and remains affected by reduced spending. We cannot
assure you that existing levels of business and consumer demand for new computer and consumer electronics products will not decrease.

We encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry.

We operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components. The competition we experience across product lines from other
companies ranges in size from large, diversified manufacturers to small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has continued to become increasingly concentrated and
globalized in recent years, and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price, and in some
instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products. We cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against
existing or new competitors.

We are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue.

Substantially all of the markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences,
which are rapid in certain end markets. Our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design, develop, introduce, and sell new and innovative products, to modify existing
products, and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change. There are numerous risks inherent in these processes, including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate
the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands.

Like other suppliers to the electronics industry, we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices.

We have historically experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, continuing pressure to lower our prices. In recent years, we
have experienced price erosion averaging from 1% to 2%. In order to maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot assure you that continuing pressures to
reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.

We are a large buyer of resin, copper, gold, brass, steel, chemicals and additives, zinc, and other precious metals. Many of these raw
materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, the price of many of


these
raw materials, including gold and copper, has increased in recent years and continues to fluctuate. In recent years, we have only been able to partially offset these increases through higher
selling prices. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw
materials deteriorates, or there are continued significant price increases for these raw materials. Any of these events could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and, to
the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers, our margins may decline, materially affecting our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and
revenue. Approximately 57% of our net sales for fiscal 2010 were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, and we expect non-U.S. Dollar revenue to represent a significant and
potentially increased portion of our future net revenue. Therefore, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the Euro, our
U.S. Dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. Changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We
manage this risk in part by entering into financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by the counterparty to these contracts, our efforts to manage these
risks might not be successful.

We may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate.

Many of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become more
concentrated in recent years, including the automotive, telecommunications, computer, and aerospace, defense, and marine industries. Consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases
from us. In addition, as our customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, and they have been able to
negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase. Our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends may
adversely affect the profit margins on our products, particularly for commodity components.

The life cycles of our products can be very short.

The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle. As a result, the resources devoted to
product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue, and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering
expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our results of operations, financial position, and cash
flows would be materially and adversely affected.

The ADC Telecommunications, Inc. acquisition and future acquisitions may not be successful.

In July 2010, we announced our entry into an agreement to acquire ADC Telecommunications, Inc. ("ADC"), and we regularly
evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses, product lines, or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings. Risks
associated with the acquisition of ADC include the risk that the transaction may not be consummated, the risk that regulatory approval that may be required for the transaction is not obtained or is
obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated, risks associated with our ability to issue debt to fund a portion of the purchase price, the risk that ADC will not be integrated successfully
into Tyco Electronics, and the risk that revenue opportunities, cost savings, and other anticipated synergies from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than


expected.
We also cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with other acquisition candidates in the future. Nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will
be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows
could be materially and adversely affected.

Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity.

If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks,
public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other
leverage measures. We cannot assure you that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to undertake an acquisition partially or
wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares.

Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel.

Our success depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees at our operations around the world. We depend on highly
skilled technical personnel to design, manufacture, and support our wide range of electronic components. Additionally, we rely upon experienced managerial, marketing, and support personnel to manage
our business effectively and to successfully promote our wide range of products. Any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the necessary global management, technical, human resource, and financial
skills to achieve our objectives may have adverse affects on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We may use components and products manufactured by third parties.

We may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to
manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality
control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. We also have third-party arrangements for the manufacture of certain products, parts, and components. If these
third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our
commercial reputation could be damaged.

Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology.

The electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry,
companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or
invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will choose not to pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the importance of the technology, product,
patent, trademark, or trade secret in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash
flows.


A decline in the market value of our pension plans' investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could adversely affect our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

Concerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with concerns about credit, inflation, or deflation, have caused
significant volatility in the price of all securities, including fixed income and equity, which has and could further reduce the value of our pension plans' investment portfolios. In addition, the
expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved. A decrease in the value of our pension plans' investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding.

The global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted, which has reduced the availability of
investment capital and credit. If these conditions continue or worsen, we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business. Our inability to access adequate funding or to
generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures. The extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash
flows, the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity, the cost of financing, and other general economic and business conditions.

Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

While we have substantially completed the streamlining of our portfolio that we began over three years ago, we may in the future
evaluate the performance of specific businesses and products and may continue to sell businesses or product lines. Any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those
related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including
difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, and the potential
loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered.

Recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill could negatively affect our results of operations.

We test goodwill allocated to reporting units for impairment annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if events
occur or circumstances exist that indicate that a reporting unit's carrying value may exceed its fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and
determined that no impairment existed. Significant judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including,
among others, operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in
applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill. Should economic conditions further deteriorate or remain depressed, estimates of future cash flows for our reporting units may be
insufficient to support carrying value and the goodwill assigned to it, requiring us to test for impairment. Impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and financial
position.


If any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations, our business may suffer.

Our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in
particular the United States and the European Union. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of
our commercial, including distribution, agreements and practices with respect to the electrical components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and
other penalties. We also may be subject to third party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or
require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce any of our commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods
into or from the relevant jurisdiction, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are subject to global risks of political, economic, and military instability.

Our workforce, manufacturing, administrative, and sales facilities, markets, customers, and suppliers are located throughout the world,
and we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including:

•

tariffs, trade barriers, and trade disputes;

•

regulations related to customs and import/export matters;

•

variations in lengths of payment cycles;

•

tax issues, such as tax law changes, examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country,
and difficulties in repatriating in a tax-efficient manner cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions;

•

challenges in collecting accounts receivable;

•

employment regulations and local labor conditions;

•

difficulties protecting intellectual property;

•

instability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, and actual or anticipated military or
political conflicts; and

•

the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements.

We
have sizeable operations in China, including manufacturing operations, and in fiscal 2010, 16% of our net sales were made to customers in China. The legal system in China is still
developing and is subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders for products in China could be adversely affected by changes to or interpretation of Chinese law.

We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and
their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these
anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with
anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot


assure
you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of
such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, and violations.

We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various
countries where we operate governing, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment;

•

investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites;

•

greenhouse gas emissions; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

We
may not have been, or we may not at all times be, in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, or
otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or
materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigative, removal, and remedial costs under certain federal and state laws are
retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or
exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerly owned
sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for
the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites.

While
we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future
environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect
our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present,
or future business activities.

Our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, and recycling.

The EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing
environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other
related matters. These laws include the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances, End of Life Vehicle, and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the EU REACH (chemical registration)
Directive, the China law on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution by Electronic Information Products, and various other laws. These laws prohibit the use of


certain
substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing,
labeling, and other matters. These laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These
laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions.

We are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and
cash flows.

In the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual
property rights, anti-competitive behavior, product liability, breach of contract, and employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and antitrust laws permit
successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we
may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our bank credit facility contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt (as defined in the credit
facility) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (as defined in the credit facility) and limits on the amount of subsidiary
debt and incurrence of liens. Our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability to
consolidate, merge, and sell assets.

Although
none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our continued ability to meet the bank credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond
our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures. Upon
the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our
lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our bank credit facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will
have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration of
any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder.

The
indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available or access to
funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change
of control triggering event.



Risks Relating to Our Separation from Tyco International

We share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date.

In connection with our separation from Tyco International in 2007, we, Tyco International, and its former healthcare businesses
("Covidien") entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement pursuant to which we share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula
for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from
adjustments made by tax authorities to our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to
intercompany transactions or similar adjustments, and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation. All costs and expenses associated with the
management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing
Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

All
the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses, including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from Tyco International, became our tax liabilities. Although we
agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco
International and Covidien default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such
liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Tyco
International's, and Covidien's tax liabilities.

Our,
Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. We are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax
adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that we have assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740,

Income Taxes

, have been
reflected as liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for
uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for
issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest
are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the
ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International has the right to administer, control, and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.
The timing, nature, and amount of any settlement agreed to by Tyco International may not be in our best interests. Moreover, the other parties to the Tax Sharing Agreement will be able to remove Tyco
International as



the
controlling party only under limited circumstances, including a change of control or bankruptcy of Tyco International, or by a majority vote of the parties on or after the second anniversary of
the
distribution. All other tax audits will be administered, controlled, and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax.

If the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could
incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

Tyco International received private letter rulings from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution
of our common shares and Covidien common shares to the Tyco International shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution, except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of our
common shares and the Covidien common shares, will qualify as tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). The private letter rulings also
provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. In addition to obtaining the private letter rulings, Tyco
International obtained opinions from outside legal counsel confirming the tax-free status of the distribution and certain internal transactions. The private letter rulings and the opinions
relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings, from us, Tyco International, and Covidien regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and
other matters. Notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable
transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distributions should be taxable for other
reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution. If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, Tyco International would recognize
gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares and Covidien common shares distributed to Tyco International shareholders on the distribution date over Tyco
International's tax basis in such common shares, but such gain, if recognized, generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, we would incur significant U.S. federal income tax
liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation should be treated as taxable transactions.

In
addition, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable and such determination was the result
of actions taken after the distribution by us, Tyco International, or Covidien, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us, Tyco International, or Covidien
as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us, Tyco International, or Covidien, then we, Tyco International, or Covidien would be
responsible for 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on us, Tyco International, or Covidien as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. In the event that
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be
responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party's obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other party's taxes.

Risks Relating to Our Swiss Jurisdiction of Incorporation

Legislative and other proposals in Switzerland, the United States, and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate.

Various U.S. and non-U.S. legislative proposals and other initiatives have been directed at companies incorporated in
lower-tax jurisdictions. We believe that recently there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and other initiatives. If adopted, these proposed changes could



materially
increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate. We believe that, since becoming a Swiss corporation in June 2009, we are less likely to be subject to such legislation and other
initiatives because Switzerland has both a generally imposed corporate income tax and comprehensive tax treaties with the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. However, we cannot
predict the outcome of any specific legislation or initiative, and we cannot assure you that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us.

Legislation in the United States could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our
business by denying government contracts to U.S. companies that have moved to lower-tax jurisdictions.

We
expect the U.S. Congress to continue to consider implementation and/or expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that
have corporate locations abroad. We believe that we are less likely to be subject to such proposals since becoming a Swiss corporation in June 2009. However, we cannot predict the likelihood that, or
final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, the effect such enactments and increased
regulatory scrutiny may have on our business, or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Therefore, we cannot assure you that any such legislative action will not apply to us. In addition,
we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales
to U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of our non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential
impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot assure you that the impact will not be materially adverse to us.

As a Swiss corporation, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management.

As a Swiss corporation, our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares without shareholder
approval and without satisfying certain other requirements. Our articles of association authorize us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors, but this
authorization is limited to (i) authorized share capital up to 50% of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years, which authorization period ends on
June 22, 2011 and is subject to shareholder approval for a two-year extension again at our next annual general meeting of shareholders, and (ii) conditional share capital of
up to 50% of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to
subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital.
Swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares, and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions,
including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation, dividends, and/or voting. Moreover, under Swiss law, we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount
below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a
preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders, which would delay the timing to execute such actions. Such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility
with respect to our capital management. While we do not believe that Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management will have an adverse



effect
on us, we cannot assure you that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.

Swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against
us in Switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland would recognize
or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained
against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have
been advised that the United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Some remedies
available under the laws of United States jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as they are contrary to that
nation's public policy.

Swiss
corporate law, which applies to us, differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the
manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification
available to directors and officers. Thus, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a
jurisdiction of the United States.

Risks Relating to Our Shares

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely.

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including:

•

our quarterly or annual earnings;

•

changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide;

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global economic conditions;

•

changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;

•

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; and

•

the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies.

We might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.

In order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of Swiss withholding tax, we anticipate making any future
distributions to shareholders, prior to June 1, 2011, through a reduction of registered share capital or, after June 1, 2011, through a reduction of registered share capital or
contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax purposes). Distributions to our shareholders in the form of a reduction of registered share capital are not subject to Swiss withholding tax. To date,
since we became a Swiss corporation, all distributions on our shares approved by our shareholders have been distributions through reductions in our registered share capital. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from



contributed
surplus (as determined for Swiss tax purposes) or through a reduction of registered share capital, or that Swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future. In addition, over the
long term, the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited.

Currency fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Swiss Franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders
to Swiss withholding tax.

Under Swiss corporate law, we are required to state our year end unconsolidated Swiss statutory financial statements in Swiss Francs.
Although distributions that are effected through a return of registered share capital or contributed surplus are expected to be paid in U.S. Dollars, shareholder resolutions with respect to such
distributions are required to be stated in Swiss Francs. If the U.S. Dollar were to increase in value relative to the Swiss Franc, the U.S. Dollar amount of registered share capital available for
future distributions without Swiss withholding tax will decrease.

We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares.

The Swiss Code of Obligations regulates a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only
repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax purposes) are available. The aggregate par value of our
registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered
shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered
shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation.

Registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings.

Our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by Swiss law for Swiss companies like us that
issue registered shares (as opposed to bearer shares). This provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights, holders of our shares must be registered in our share register (Aktienbuch) as
shareholders with voting rights. Only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders' meetings, but all
shareholders will be entitled to dividends, distributions, preemptive rights, advance subscription rights, and liquidation proceeds. The board of directors may, in its discretion, refuse to register
shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association.

Certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders
might consider favorable.

Our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered "anti-takeover" provisions because they would make
it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions, among others:

•

shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent, and

•

restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15% or more of
our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors,

both
of which provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of our issued voting shares, which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal
or



delaying,
deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorably by our shareholders. Our articles of association also contain
provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital (in either case, representing a maximum of 50% of the shares presently registered in the
commercial register and in the case of issuances from authorized capital, until June 22, 2011 unless re-authorized by shareholders for a subsequent two-year period)
without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders' preemptive rights or advance subscription rights, for the purpose of the defense of an actual, threatened, or potential unsolicited
takeover bid, in relation to which the board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial advisor, has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. We note that Swiss courts have
not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under Swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance
subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital. In addition, the New York Stock Exchange, on which our shares are listed, requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to
20% or more of the outstanding shares or voting power, with limited exceptions.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Properties

Our principal offices in the United States are located in Berwyn, Pennsylvania in a facility that we rent. We operate over 100
manufacturing, warehousing, and office locations in approximately 25 states in the United States. We also operate over 250 manufacturing, warehousing, and office locations in over 50 countries and
territories outside the United States.

We
own approximately 20 million square feet of space and lease approximately 10 million square feet of space. Our facilities are reasonably maintained and suitable for the
operations conducted in them.

Manufacturing

We manufacture our products in over 20 countries worldwide. These manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of the manufacturing
processes, including our primary processes of stamping, plating, molding, extrusion, beaming, and assembly. We expect to continue to migrate our manufacturing activities to lower-cost
countries as our customers' requirements shift. In addition, we will continue to look for efficiencies to reduce our manufacturing costs and believe that we can achieve cost reductions through
improved manufacturing efficiency and through the migration of manufacturing to lower-cost countries.

We estimate that our manufacturing production by region in fiscal 2010 was approximately: Americas—30%, Europe/Middle
East/Africa—40%, and Asia-Pacific—30%.

We
expect that manufacturing production will continue to increase in the Asia-Pacific region as a percentage of total manufacturing as this region continues to experience
strong growth and our customers' manufacturing continues to migrate to the region.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Tyco Electronics Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including antitrust claims, product
liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, and other commercial disputes. In addition, we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal
claims. At any given time in the ordinary course of business, we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third party's patent
were to be determined against us, we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one
or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to us were



determined
to be invalid or unenforceable, we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount.

Management
believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these
proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial positions, or cash flows in a future period.

Legal Matters under Separation and Distribution Agreement

The Separation and Distribution Agreement among us, Tyco International, and Covidien provided for the allocation among the parties of
Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to our and Covidien's separations from Tyco International on June 29, 2007. Under the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, we assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters at separation related to our business or assumed or retained liabilities. Tyco
Electronics was responsible for 31% of certain liabilities that arose from litigation pending or threatened at separation that was not allocated to one of the three parties, and Tyco International and
Covidien were responsible for 27% and 42%, respectively, of such liabilities. If any party defaults in payment of its allocated share of any such liability, each non-defaulting party will
be responsible for an equal portion of the amount in default together with any other non-defaulting party, although any such payments will not release the obligation of the defaulting
party. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco International manages and controls all the legal matters related to the shared contingent liabilities,
including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. All costs and expenses that Tyco International incurs in connection with the defense of such litigation, other than the
amount of any judgment or settlement, which is allocated in the manner described above, will be borne equally by Tyco International, Covidien, and us. At the present time, all significant matters for
which we shared responsibility with Tyco International and Covidien under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which as previously reported in our periodic filings generally related to
securities class action cases and other securities cases, have been settled. Other than matters described below under "Compliance Matters," we presently are not aware of any additional legal matters
which may arise for which we would bear a portion of the responsibility under the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported in our periodic filings, Tyco International received and has responded to various allegations that certain
improper payments were made by Tyco International subsidiaries, including Tyco Electronics subsidiaries, in recent years prior to the separation. Tyco International reported to the U.S. Department of
Justice and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations, including that it retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide
baseline review of its policies, controls, and practices with respect to compliance with the FCPA, and that it would continue to investigate and make periodic progress reports to these agencies. To
date, our baseline review has revealed that some of our former business practices may not have complied with FCPA requirements. At this time, we believe we have adequate amounts recorded related to
these matters, the amount of which is not significant. Any judgment, settlement, or other cost incurred by Tyco International in connection with these matters not specifically allocated to Tyco
International, Covidien, or us would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement.



Litigation Matters Related to Our Former Wireless Systems Business

State of New York Contract

On September 19, 2005, our former Wireless Systems business was awarded a twenty-year lease contract with the State
of New York (the "State") to construct, operate, and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders. On August 29, 2008, we were served by
the State with a default notice related to the first regional network, pursuant to the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by
the State. On October 16, 2008, we informed the State that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and
certified the system ready for testing. The State conducted further testing during November and December 2008. On January 15, 2009, the State notified us that, in the State's opinion, we had
not fully remediated the issues cited by the State and it had determined that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract. The State contends that
it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the State in conjunction with the implementation of the network, and as a result of this contention, on January 16, 2009, the
State drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of
credit, although we dispute that the State has any basis to do so.

On
February 13, 2009, we filed a claim in the New York Court of Claims, seeking over $100 million in damages, and alleging a number of causes of action, including breach of
contract, unjust enrichment, defamation, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the imposition of a constructive trust, and seeking a declaration that the State terminated
the contract "for convenience." In September 2009, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint, with the exception of the breach of contract claims. In November 2009,
the State filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim asserting breach of contract and alleging that the State has incurred damages in excess of $275 million. We moved to dismiss the
counterclaim in February 2010, and in June 2010 the Court denied our motion. We filed our answer to the State's counterclaim in July 2010. We believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend
to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter.

Com-Net

At September 24, 2010, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001
acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system
for the State of Florida is finished and the State of Florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not
believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania,
which is in the motion pleading and discovery phase.

Dollar/Swiss Franc exchange rate shortly before shareholder approval.

Future dividends on our common shares or reductions of registered share capital for distribution to shareholders, if any, must be approved by our
shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends or distributions be approved, our board of directors will


consider
our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem
relevant. We may from time to time enter into financing agreements that contain financial covenants and restrictions, some of which may limit our ability to pay dividends or to distribute capital
reductions.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans,
estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those
factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Our
Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States Dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").

The Separation

Tyco Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of then Bermuda-based Tyco
International. For the period following its incorporation, Tyco Electronics Ltd. did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal assets. Effective June 29, 2007,
we became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International. On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics, as well as its
shares of its former healthcare businesses, to its common shareholders.

Change of Domicile

Effective June 25, 2009, Tyco Electronics Ltd. discontinued its existence as a Bermuda company as provided in the Bermuda
Companies Act, and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued its existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of
the Swiss Code of Obligations. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations.

Overview

We are a leading global provider of engineered electronic components, network solutions, specialty products, and subsea communication
systems. We design, manufacture, and market approximately 450,000 different products for customers in a broad array of industries including automotive; data communications equipment and consumer
electronics; telecommunications; aerospace, defense, and marine; medical; energy; and lighting. We believe the end markets that we sell into are balanced with the total end market demand for our
products. Our Electronic Components segment serves both consumer and industrial and infrastructure markets with 70% of sales occurring in the consumer based markets. Our Network Solutions, Specialty
Products, and Subsea Communications segments serve primarily industrial and infrastructure based markets.

We
operate through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Specialty Products, and Subsea Communications. See Notes 1 and 24 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments.

We
service our customers primarily through our direct sales force that serves customers in over 150 countries. The sales force is supported by approximately 7,000 engineers as well as
globally deployed manufacturing sites. Through our sales force and engineering resources, we are able to collaborate with our customers throughout the world to provide highly engineered products and
solutions to meet their needs.



Our
strategic objective is to increase our revenue and profitability across all of our segments in the markets we serve. This strategy is dependent upon the following strategic
priorities:

•

Deliver extraordinary customer service;

•

Strengthen our innovation leadership;

•

Achieve market leadership in attractive and under-penetrated industries;

•

Extend our leadership in emerging markets; and

•

Supplement organic growth with strategic partnerships and acquisitions.

Economic Conditions

Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by regional and worldwide economic conditions. Our sales
are dependent on certain industry end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in
those markets. Overall, we experienced a 17.7% increase in net sales in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, net sales decreased 28.6% as compared to fiscal 2008. Our sales into
consumer based markets, particularly in the automotive and appliance end markets, and to a lesser degree, our sales into the computer end market, all in our Electronic Components segment, have
improved relative to last year but still remain below fiscal 2008 levels. Sales in the industrial and infrastructure end markets served by our Network Solutions segment improved in fiscal 2010,
marginally exceeding sales of fiscal 2009 but remained below fiscal 2008 levels as these are later cycle markets. Sales in fiscal 2010 in our Specialty Products segment continued to improve and were
above fiscal 2009 levels, but remained below fiscal 2008 sales levels. Relative to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect first quarter sales in the consumer based markets to increase slightly,
with a modest decrease in the industrial and infrastructure based markets. On a company-wide basis, net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 are expected to be between $3.05 and
$3.15 billion, an increase of 5 to 9 percent over the same period of fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2011, which will be 53 weeks in length, we expect net sales to increase 6 to
9 percent from fiscal 2010 levels and to be between $12.8 and $13.2 billion. In the first fiscal quarter of 2011, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.63 to
$0.67 per share. For fiscal 2011, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.00 per share with approximately $0.05 per share attributable to the additional week. This
outlook assumes current foreign exchange and commodity rates and does not include results related to the anticipated acquisition of ADC.

We
are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and on the end markets we serve. Additionally, we continue to closely manage our costs in order to
respond to changing conditions. We are also managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. (See
further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources.")

Acquisitions

On August 6, 2010, we acquired the remaining outstanding equity interests of PlanarMag, Inc. ("PlanarMag") for
$23 million in cash and the forgiveness of an approximate $1 million loan payable. Prior to the acquisition, we owned approximately 14% of PlanarMag. The net assets acquired, which are
not material, are reported as part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions business within the Electronic Components segment.

On
May 14, 2010, we acquired certain assets of the Optical Products Group of Zarlink Semiconductor Inc. ("Zarlink") for $15 million in cash. The assets acquired,
primarily definite-lived



intangible
assets, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment, are reported as part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions business within the Electronic Components segment.

On
January 20, 2010, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Sensitive Object, an early-stage software company engaged in developing touch-enabling
technology focused on computers, mobile devices, and consumer electronics, for a purchase price of approximately $67 million in cash, including contingent consideration of $6 million to
be paid in fiscal 2011 upon completion of certain service requirements by key Sensitive Object managers. The acquisition complements our existing Touch Systems business, which is primarily focused on
commercial and industrial markets. Sensitive Object is reported as part of our Touch Systems business within the Specialty Products segment.

See
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.

Anticipated Acquisition

On July 12, 2010, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with ADC under which we agreed to
acquire ADC for a total purchase price of approximately $1.25 billion. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of ADC
common stock at a purchase price of $12.75 per share in cash followed by a merger with and into ADC. The initial offer, dated July 26, 2010, has been extended to November 15, 2010. As of
October 18, 2010, approximately 86.5 million common shares of ADC had been tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the tender offer, representing approximately 89% of the outstanding
common shares of ADC. In accordance with the terms of the tender offer, ADC shareholders have the right to withdraw their previously tendered shares prior to the expiration of the offer.

The
transaction is expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The consummation of the transaction is subject to various closing conditions including the tender of
a majority of ADC's shares, regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions. The Merger Agreement also includes customary termination provisions for both ADC and us and provides that, in
connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, ADC will be required to pay us a termination fee of $38 million.

See
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.

Divestitures

During fiscal 2010, we sold our mechatronics business within the Electronic Components segment for net cash proceeds of
$3 million. This business designs and manufactures customer-specific components, primarily for the automotive industry, and generated sales of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2010.
In connection with the sale, we recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $41 million.

Also,
in fiscal 2010, we completed the sale of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line which was part of our energy business in the Network Solutions segment for net cash
proceeds of $12 million. In connection with the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge related to long-lived assets and a pre-tax loss on sale
of $12 million and $1 million, respectively, in fiscal 2010. Also, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $12 million in fiscal 2009 to write the carrying value of
the assets and liabilities down to fair value. The Dulmison connectors and fittings product line generated sales of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2009.

During
fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the Battery Systems business, which was part of the Electronic Components segment, for net cash proceeds of $14 million after working
capital



adjustments.
The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of $7 million. A pre-tax impairment charge of $22 million was recorded in fiscal 2008 to write the
carrying value of the assets and liabilities down to fair value.

The
loss on divestitures and impairment charges are presented in restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We have presented the loss on
divestitures, related long-lived asset impairments, and the operations of the mechatronics business, Dulmison connectors and fittings product line, and Battery Systems business in
continuing operations due to immateriality. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestitures.

Discontinued Operations

In fiscal 2010, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $44 million primarily in connection with the favorable
resolution of certain litigation contingencies related to the Printed Circuit Group business which was sold in fiscal 2007.

In
May 2009, we completed the sale of the Wireless Systems business for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on the
transaction.

In
September 2008, we completed the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for net cash proceeds of $427 million and recorded a $184 million
pre-tax gain on the sale. Also, in September 2008, we completed the sale of the Automotive Radar Sensors business for net cash proceeds of $42 million and recorded a
$31 million pre-tax gain on the sale. In fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds of $29 million and recognized an additional pre-tax gain on sale of
$4 million in connection with the finalization of working capital adjustments related to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses.

In
fiscal 2008, we completed the sale of the Power Systems business for $102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $51 million pre-tax gain on the sale.

The
Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, Automotive Radar Sensors, Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group businesses met the held for sale and discontinued
operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to held for sale and discontinued
operations, the Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses were components of the former Wireless Systems segment. The Power Systems and
Printed Circuit Group businesses were components of the Other segment, which was subsequently renamed the Subsea Communications segment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Manufacturing Simplification

Since our separation, we have been working on the simplification of our global manufacturing footprint, by migrating facilities from
higher-cost to lower-cost countries, consolidating within countries, and transferring product lines to
lower-cost countries. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for profitability growth in
the years ahead.

In
connection with our manufacturing simplification plan, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $30 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, cash spending
related to restructuring was $190 million, and we anticipate spending approximately $130 million in fiscal 2011, relating to both manufacturing simplification and prior year business
resizing. Annualized cost savings related to the manufacturing simplification plan are expected to be approximately $20 million. These costs exclude potential restructuring costs that may arise
from the acquisition of ADC.



Correction of Immaterial Errors

During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we identified certain errors in our accounting for income taxes. These errors related to the
adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, in fiscal 2008 and data utilized in the determination of our income tax
provision in fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2009.

In
connection with the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we failed to reflect, in the calculation of interest and penalties, the impact of the interest
component of a prepayment made to the IRS in fiscal 2007. As a result of this error, we overstated deferred tax assets, receivable from Tyco International Ltd. and Covidien plc,
noncurrent income taxes payable, and other income by $64 million, $81 million, $182 million, and $81 million, respectively, and understated accumulated earnings by
$118 million in fiscal 2008. The impacts to other income and receivable from Tyco International Ltd. and Covidien plc result from the shared nature of the tax liabilities pursuant
to the Tax Sharing Agreement entered into upon separation from Tyco International.

We
also identified errors in certain reports used, in part, to determine our income tax provision. As a result of these errors, we understated income tax expense and overstated deferred
tax assets by $9 million, $14 million, $13 million, $12 million, and $9 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

We
evaluated the effects of these errors individually and in the aggregate and determined that our prior period financial statements are not materially misstated. However, we determined
that the cumulative effect of correcting these errors in fiscal 2010 would be material to the fiscal 2010 financial statements. Therefore, we corrected these errors in the affected prior periods and
presented the results in this Annual Report. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the correction of immaterial errors.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic net sales growth, which is included in the discussion below, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference
between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates,
acquisitions, and divestitures. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not completely under management's control,
such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.

We
believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it
provides investors with a view of our operations from management's perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying
results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations
of our reporting segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and
analysis of organic net sales growth in Results of Operations below utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other
companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented below may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial
measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales.
This limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables presented in



Results
of Operations below provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP.

Results of Operations

Consolidated Operations

Key business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this report
include:

•

Raw material price
increases.

We purchased approximately 160 million pounds of copper and 200,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2010. During the
periods shown, copper and gold prices, as well as the prices of certain other raw materials, have been volatile and current year prices have increased from prior year levels. The following table sets
forth the average prices incurred related to copper and gold during the periods presented:

In
fiscal 2011, we expect to purchase approximately 170 million pounds of copper and 180,000 troy ounces of gold.

•

Foreign
exchange.

Approximately 57% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our results of operations are
influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. Dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we
translate those currencies into U.S. Dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 by major currencies invoiced was as follows:

Net Sales.

Net sales increased $1,814 million, or 17.7%, to $12,070 million in fiscal 2010 from $10,256 million
in fiscal 2009.
In fiscal 2009, net sales decreased $4,117 million, or 28.6%, to $10,256 million from $14,373 million in fiscal 2008. On an organic basis, net sales increased
$1,712 million, or 16.7%, in fiscal 2010. The increase primarily resulted from strong growth in our
Electronic Components segment and, to a lesser degree, our Specialty Products segment, partially offset by a decline in our Subsea Communications segment. On an organic basis, net sales decreased
$3,542 million, or 24.6%, in fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of declines in our Electronic Components, Specialty Products, and Network Solutions segments. In fiscal 2010, foreign currency
exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $188 million, or 1.8%. Foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro, negatively impacted net sales by $474 million, or 3.3%, in
fiscal 2009. Price erosion adversely affected net sales by $169 million, $187 million, and $187 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. See further discussion below

Gross Margin.

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 31.3% in fiscal 2010 as compared to 24.7% in fiscal 2009.
The increase was due
primarily to higher sales and improved manufacturing productivity, and to a lesser degree, favorable product mix and cost reductions achieved from restructuring actions implemented during fiscal 2009.

In
fiscal 2009, gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 24.7% from 29.0% in fiscal 2008. The decrease was due to sales declines and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing
costs associated with reduced production levels related to lower sales and our efforts to reduce inventory levels, partially offset by cost reductions from restructuring actions.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were
12.7% and 13.7% in
fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Fiscal 2009 results included a net loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and
resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. Excluding this item, selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 further decreased as a percentage of
net sales as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of increased sales and cost reductions achieved from restructuring actions implemented during fiscal 2009.

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 13.7% in fiscal 2009 as compared to 10.9% in fiscal 2008. As discussed above, in fiscal 2009,
results included a net loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of
certain eastern European currencies. In fiscal 2008, selling, general, and administrative expenses included a $36 million gain on the sale of real estate related to our Electronic Components
segment. Excluding these items, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due to the decrease in sales volume.

Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses.

Research, development, and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales
decreased to 4.8% in
fiscal 2010 from 5.2% in fiscal 2009. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was attributable to higher net sales partially offset by increased investment in research and development across our
businesses during fiscal 2010. Research, development, and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 5.2% in fiscal 2009 as compared to 4.1% in fiscal 2008. The increase as a
percentage of net sales was due to decreases in sales volume as well as our continued focus on future technologies within all four of our operating segments in fiscal 2009.



Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.

In fiscal 2010, net restructuring and other charges were $137 million as compared to
$375 million
in fiscal 2009 and $219 million in fiscal 2008. Total charges, including amounts reflected in cost of sales, were $134 million, $373 million, and $228 million in fiscal
2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Fiscal
2010 restructuring actions primarily related to headcount reductions in the Electronic Components segment. Fiscal 2010 charges included a pre-tax loss on sale of
$41 million related to the sale of our mechatronics business which was part of our Electronic Components segment as well as long-lived asset impairment charges of $12 million
and a loss on sale of $1 million related to the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line which was part of the energy business in our Network Solutions segment.

Fiscal
2009 restructuring actions reduced costs in response to market conditions and primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures in the Electronic
Components, Network Solutions, and Specialty Products segments. Fiscal 2009 charges included a long-lived asset impairment of $14 million in our Network Solutions segment primarily
related to the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line and a loss on sale of $7 million related to the sale of the Battery Systems business which was part of the
Electronic Components segment.

Fiscal
2008 restructuring actions related to the migration of product lines to lower-cost countries and the exit of certain manufacturing operations in the Electronic
Components and Network Solutions segments. Fiscal 2008 charges included long-lived asset impairments in our Electronic Components segment of $34 million, consisting of
$22 million related to the divestiture of the Battery Systems business and $12 million related to certain dedicated manufacturing lines serving the North American automotive market.

See
Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Pre-separation Litigation Charges (Income), Net.

During fiscal 2010, Tyco International settled the remaining securities lawsuit,
 a class
action captioned

Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

, for $79 million. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, our share of the settlement amount was $24 million. As discussed below, we had previously established reserves for this case. As a result of the settlement of the

Stumpf

case, we concluded that reserves of $22 million could be released. Accordingly, pursuant to the sharing formula, we recorded income of
$7 million during fiscal 2010. As of September 24, 2010, there were no remaining significant securities lawsuits outstanding.

During
fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $144 million for our share of Tyco International's settlements of several securities cases and our portion of the estimated probable
loss for the then remaining securities litigation claims, including the

Stumpf

case, subject to the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

During
fiscal 2008, we recorded charges of $34 million for our share of Tyco International's settlements of two securities cases and income of $12 million for our portion
of related recoveries of certain costs from insurers.

See
"Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding pre-separation
securities litigation.

Impairment of Goodwill.

During fiscal 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3,435 million in our Electronic
Components segment,
of which $2,088 million and $1,347 million related to the Automotive and Communications and Industrial Solutions reporting units, respectively. We also recorded a goodwill impairment
charge of $112 million related to the Circuit Protection reporting unit of our Specialty Products segment in fiscal 2009.



During
fiscal 2008, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $103 million which related to the Global Application Tooling Division reporting unit of our Electronic Components
segment.

See
Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of goodwill.

Operating Income (Loss).

Operating income was $1,516 million in fiscal 2010 compared to an operating loss of
$3,474 million in fiscal
2009. Fiscal 2010 results included restructuring and other charges, acquisition and integration costs, and pre-separation litigation income of $134 million, $8 million, and
$7 million, respectively. Fiscal 2009 results included goodwill impairment charges, restructuring and other charges, and pre-separation litigation charges of $3,547 million,
$373 million, and $144 million, respectively. In addition, fiscal 2009 results included a net loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of
certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. Excluding these items, the remaining increase in operating income resulted
primarily from higher sales and related gross margins, higher gross margins as a percentage of sales due to favorable product mix, and cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in
fiscal 2009, partially offset by price erosion.

Operating
loss was $3,474 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to operating income of $1,663 million in fiscal 2008. As discussed above fiscal 2009 results included goodwill
impairment charges, restructuring and other charges, and pre-separation litigation charges of $3,547 million, $373 million, and $144 million, respectively, as well as
a net loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern
European currencies. In fiscal 2008, operating income included restructuring and other charges, goodwill impairment charges, a gain on the sale of real estate, and net pre-separation
litigation charges of $228 million, $103 million, $36 million, and $22 million, respectively. Excluding these items, the decreases in operating income resulted from lower
sales levels and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels and the focus on reducing inventories, which were partially offset by cost reduction programs.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009

Electronic Components' net sales increased $2,109 million, or 35.4%, to $8,070 million in fiscal 2010 from
$5,961 million in fiscal 2009. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably affected net sales by $123 million, or 2.4%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Organic
net sales increased $2,033 million, or 33.8%, in fiscal 2010 due primarily to growth in the automotive end market of $1,232 million and, to a lesser degree, growth across all other end
markets we serve.

Organic
net sales increased 42.5% in the automotive end market in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was broad-based and resulted from growth of 61.4% in the
Asia-Pacific region, 40.1% in the Americas region, and 33.8% in the EMEA region driven by increases in vehicle production and replenishment of inventory in the supply chain across all
regions. Our organic net sales increased 17.4% in the DataComm end market in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of



an
increase in sales of our interconnect components to communication equipment manufacturers. In the industrial end market, our organic net sales increased 32.5% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal
2009 due primarily to increased demand for factory automation and other industrial equipment in all regions, with the highest growth in Asia. Our organic net sales growth of 36.7% in the appliance end
market in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was attributable to improved consumer demand across all regions, particularly in Asia. In fiscal 2010, our organic net sales growth of 14.9% in the
computer end market as compared to fiscal 2009 resulted from recovery in emerging markets and rising demand for portables, such as notebook computers. Our organic net sales growth of 7.4% in the
consumer devices end market in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to an increase in sales to mobile phone manufacturers.

Electronic
Components had operating income of $967 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to an operating loss of $3,716 million in fiscal 2009. Segment results included
restructuring and other charges of $108 million and $278 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Also, during fiscal 2009, segment
results included $3,435 million of goodwill impairment charges and a net foreign currency loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain
anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. Excluding these items, the remaining increase resulted primarily from increases in
sales and higher gross margins as a percentage of sales, as well as cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in fiscal 2009, favorable product mix, and improved manufacturing
productivity.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008

In fiscal 2009 Electronic Components' net sales decreased $3,316 million, or 35.7%, to $5,961 million from
$9,277 million in fiscal 2008. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $287 million, or 3.0%, in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Organic net
sales decreased by $2,936 million, or 31.7%, in fiscal 2009 primarily due to declines in volume in all of the end markets we serve.

Electronic
Components organic net sales decreased 33.3% in the automotive end market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was broad-based and resulted from declines of
36.8% in the North America region, 37.1% in the EMEA region, and 25.7% in the Asia-Pacific region that were driven by reductions in production by automotive manufacturers as well as
inventory reductions throughout the automotive supply chain. In the DataComm end market, our organic net sales decline of 30.5% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was driven by declines of
25.9% and 27.4% in our sales of interconnect components to communication equipment manufacturers and mobile phone manufacturers, respectively. In fiscal 2009, our organic net sales decreased 32.2% in
the industrial end market as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of reduced demand for factory automation and other industrial equipment due to declines in capital investments by our
customers. Our organic net sales decline of 35.9% in the computer end market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was attributable to general market weakness, inventory corrections in the supply
chain, and reductions in market share related to our strategy to improve margins by exiting certain low-margin portions of this market. In the appliance end market, our organic net sales
decreased 30.1% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to reduced consumer demand, weak housing starts, and retailer inventory reductions.

Electronic
Components had an operating loss of $3,716 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to income of $978 million in fiscal 2008. As discussed above, segment results
included goodwill impairment charges of $3,435 million and $103 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Also, segment results included a $36 million gain on the sale of
real estate in fiscal 2008. Excluding these items, the remaining decrease in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 resulted from the sales decline and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs
associated with reduced production levels and inventory reductions, partially offset by cost savings from restructuring actions. In addition, fiscal 2009 segment results were negatively impacted by an
increase in restructuring and other charges of



$80 million
and a net foreign currency loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from
the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009

In fiscal 2010, Network Solutions' net sales increased $8 million, or 0.5%, to $1,727 million from $1,719 million
in fiscal 2009. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably affected net sales by $42 million, or 2.6%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The divestiture of the Dulmison
connectors and fittings product line decreased net sales by $39 million, or 2.4%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Organic net sales increased $5 million, or 0.3%, in fiscal
2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.

In
the energy end market, our organic net sales decrease of 1.5% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due to lower investment levels by utilities and reduced customer inventory
levels. In the service providers end market, our organic net sales decrease of 2.6% in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 levels was primarily attributable to reduced wireline capital spending by
telecommunications companies. In the enterprise networks end market, organic sales increased 7.3% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of strong economic recoveries in Asia and
Europe, while the Americas remained relatively flat.

In
fiscal 2010, Network Solutions' operating income increased $44 million to $177 million from $133 million in fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily attributable
to a decrease in restructuring and other charges of $37 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in fiscal 2009, and
favorable product mix, partially offset by $8 million of acquisition and integration costs related to our anticipated acquisition of ADC.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008

Network Solutions' net sales decreased $443 million, or 20.5%, to $1,719 million in fiscal 2009 from
$2,162 million in fiscal 2008. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $165 million, or 7.6%, in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Organic net
sales decreased $270 million, or 12.5%, in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008.

Our
organic net sales decreased 8.8% in the energy industry end market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to declines in Europe. Sales in Europe were negatively
impacted by slower investment levels by utilities and reduced customer inventory levels. In the service providers end market, our organic net sales decrease of 12.4% in fiscal 2009 as compared to
fiscal 2008 was largely due to a general slowing of capital spending by telecommunications companies. Our organic sales in the enterprise networks end market decreased 19.1% in fiscal 2009 as compared
to fiscal 2008 as a result of global declines in commercial construction and delayed investment in network upgrades.

Network
Solutions' operating income decreased $118 million, or 47.0%, to $133 million in fiscal 2009 from $251 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease was the result of
decreased sales, unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels and our targeted inventory reductions, and an increase in restructuring and other charges of
$34 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009

Specialty Products' net sales increased $134 million, or 9.5%, to $1,549 million in fiscal 2010 from
$1,415 million in fiscal 2009. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively affected net sales by $23 million, or 1.6%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Organic
net sales increased $111 million, or 7.9%, during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.

In
the aerospace, defense, and marine end market, our organic net sales decline of 0.8% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due to weak demand in the marine and commercial
aircraft markets, partially offset by growth in the defense market. Our organic net sales growth of 16.9% in the touch systems end market in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 was due to improved demand in
North America and Asia, particularly with point-of-sale terminal manufacturers, partially offset by continued weakness in global demand in the gaming markets. During fiscal
2010, our organic net sales growth of 29.7% in the circuit protection end market as compared to fiscal 2009 resulted from increased demand in the consumer electronics and computer industries in Asia,
as well as global automotive and industrial markets. In the medical end market, our organic net sales decreased by 0.1% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of lower capital spending
by healthcare providers, partially offset by increased demand for disposable products.



Specialty
Products' operating income increased $196 million to $230 million in fiscal 2010 from $34 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, segment results were
negatively impacted by $112 million of
goodwill impairment charges. Excluding this item, the remaining increase in operating income was due primarily to a decrease in restructuring and other charges of $26 million as compared to
fiscal 2009 and an increase in gross margin, primarily as a result of the increase in sales, and to a lesser degree, cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in fiscal 2009, as
well as improved manufacturing productivity.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008

In fiscal 2009, Specialty Products' net sales decreased $354 million, or 20.0%, to $1,415 million from
$1,769 million in fiscal 2008. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $22 million, or 1.2%, in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Organic net
sales decreased $332 million, or 18.8%, in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008.

Our
organic net sales declined 14.0% in the aerospace, defense, and marine end market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of slowing demand for commercial aircraft and
inventory corrections in the supply chain. In the touch systems end market, our organic net sales decreased 23.7% in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due to global weakness in demand from the retail
market. On an organic basis, our net sales decline of 32.1% in the circuit protection end market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due to reduced original equipment manufacturer production
levels as well as significant inventory corrections in the supply chain. In the medical end market, our organic net sales decrease of 8.6% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due to
inventory corrections in the supply chain and delayed capital spending by most healthcare providers.

Specialty
Products' operating results decreased $262 million to $34 million in fiscal 2009 from $296 million in fiscal 2008. As discussed above, segment results
included a goodwill impairment charge of $112 million in fiscal 2009. The remaining decrease in operating results was due to lower sales, unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs
associated with reduced production levels and our targeted inventory reductions, and an increase in restructuring and other charges of $28 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009

Subsea Communications' net sales decreased $437 million, or 37.6%, to $724 million in fiscal 2010 from
$1,161 million in fiscal 2009. The decrease resulted from the completion of certain large projects during fiscal 2009 and lower levels of project activity in fiscal 2010.

In
fiscal 2010, Subsea Communications' operating income decreased $84 million to $135 million from $219 million in fiscal 2009. The decrease resulted from lower
sales in the current fiscal year, partially offset by favorable execution on projects and recognition of revenue previously deferred as a result of cash collections.



Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008

In fiscal 2009, Subsea Communications' net sales decreased $4 million, or 0.3%, to $1,161 million from
$1,165 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, revenue from existing and new projects offset the reduction caused by the completion, in fiscal 2008, of a transoceanic system that connects the
U.S. and China.

In
fiscal 2009, Subsea Communications' operating income increased $59 million to $219 million from $160 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease in income from the
transoceanic system and an increase in restructuring and other charges of $3 million were more than offset by income from existing and new projects and favorable project mix in fiscal 2009 as
compared to fiscal 2008.

New Segment Structure for Fiscal 2011

Effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we reorganized our management and our segments to further align the organization around
our strategy. Our businesses in the Specialty Products Group—Aerospace, Defense, and Marine; Medical Products; Circuit Protection; and Touch Systems—have been moved into other
segments. Also, the Subsea Communications segment has been included within the Network Solutions segment. The following represents the new segment structure:

•

Transportation Connectivity.

This segment consists of our
Automotive and Aerospace, Defense, and Marine businesses.

•

Communications and Industrial Solutions.

This segment
contains our DataComm, Industrial Products, Consumer Devices, Lighting, Alternative Energy, Medical Products, Circuit Protection, and Touch Systems businesses.

•

Network Solutions.

The Subsea Communications, Telecom
Service Providers, Enterprise Networks, and Energy businesses are included in this segment. Also, when the ADC acquisition is complete, it will be integrated into this segment.

In
this Annual Report, results for fiscal 2010 and prior periods are reported on the basis under which we managed our business in fiscal 2010 and do not reflect the fiscal 2011 segment
reorganization.

Non-Operating Items

Interest Expense, Net

Net interest expense was $135 million, $148 million, and $158 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008,
respectively. The decrease of $13 million, or 8.8%, in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was due to lower average debt levels resulting in lower interest expense. The decrease of $10 million,
or 6.3%, in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was driven by lower average debt levels partially offset by lower interest income.

Other Income (Expense), Net

In fiscal 2010, we recorded net other income of $177 million, primarily consisting of income pursuant to the Tax Sharing
Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. The income in fiscal 2010 reflects a net increase to the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien primarily related to certain proposed
adjustments to prior period income tax returns and related
accrued interest, partially offset by a decrease related to the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year income tax returns. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement.

In
fiscal 2009, we recorded net other expense of $48 million, consisting of $68 million of expense pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and
Covidien, a $22 million gain on the



retirement
of debt, and $2 million of unrealized losses on rabbi trust assets. The $68 million of expense is attributable to a net reduction of an indemnification asset primarily as a
result of the settlement of various matters with the IRS. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the gain on retirement of debt.

In
fiscal 2008, we recorded other income of $486 million, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien, of which $464 million related to
certain incremental tax liabilities recorded in connection with the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

. See
Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740.

Income Taxes

Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. We have provided for
income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation. In fiscal 2009, we changed our place
of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. We do not expect the change to materially impact our tax provision or cash tax burden.

Our
effective income tax rate was 31.6% for fiscal 2010 and reflects a charge of $307 million primarily associated with certain proposed adjustments to prior year income tax
returns and related accrued interest partially offset by an income tax benefit of $101 million recognized in connection with the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year
income tax returns. In addition, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 reflects an income tax benefit of $72 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance
associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. locations.

Our
effective income tax rate was 15.4% for fiscal 2009 and includes the effects of the $3,547 million pre-tax impairment of goodwill for which a partial tax benefit
of $523 million was recorded, a $144 million pre-tax charge related to pre-separation securities litigation for which a partial tax benefit of $25 million
was recorded, a $28 million charge related to the settlement of a tax matter, and a $24 million detriment related to a $68 million pre-tax expense recognized pursuant
to our Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. Additionally, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects adjustments related to prior years tax returns, including a
$49 million tax benefit.

Our
effective income tax rate was 27.8% for fiscal 2008 and includes a benefit of $170 million primarily related to the pre-tax income pursuant to the Tax Sharing
Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien of $464 million recognized in connection with our adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, for which no tax was provided. The
effective income tax rate was also impacted by increased accruals in fiscal 2008 of interest related to uncertain tax positions partially offset by a $42 million benefit associated with a
favorable settlement with a taxing authority for certain pre-separation tax issues. In addition, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects the benefits of increased
profitability in operations in lower tax rate jurisdictions, a $33 million benefit related to adjustments to tax account balances, a $25 million increase in the valuation allowance
related to restructuring charges, and a $22 million tax detriment recorded in connection with the goodwill impairment charge for which a tax benefit was not fully realized.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $2,236 million and $2,487 million at fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty
of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable
income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC
740 which require that a valuation allowance be



established
or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our
operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss
carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities.
These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our
current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded
amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate
of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized.

We
have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in
fiscal 2011. No additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for
temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or
we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 24, 2010, certain subsidiaries had approximately
$14 billion of undistributed earnings that we intend to permanently reinvest. A liability could arise if our intentions to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are
distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis
differences related to investments in subsidiaries.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes

Income from discontinued operations was $44 million in fiscal 2010 compared to losses from discontinued operations of
$156 million in fiscal 2009. Income from discontinued operations was $255 million in fiscal 2008.

In
fiscal 2010, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $44 million primarily in connection with the favorable resolution of certain litigation contingencies related to
the Printed Circuit Group business which was sold in fiscal 2007.

In
May 2009, we completed the sale of the Wireless Systems business for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on the
transaction. Also, in fiscal 2009, we recognized an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the finalization of working capital adjustments related to the
sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses.

Pre-tax
loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 included pre-tax charges of $111 million related to the Wireless Systems business's contract with
the State of New York. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the State of New York contract. Income tax expense on discontinued operations
for fiscal 2009 included $68 million relating to the impact of $319 million of goodwill written off in connection with the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business, for which a tax
benefit was not fully realized, as well as $35 million of unfavorable



adjustments
to the estimated tax provision on the Power Systems business as a result of the finalization of the tax basis of assets sold upon the filing of the fiscal 2008 income tax returns.

In
September 2008, we completed the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for net cash proceeds of $427 million and recorded a $184 million
pre-tax gain on the sale. In September 2008, we also completed the sale of the Automotive Radar Sensors business for net cash proceeds of $42 million and recorded a
$31 million pre-tax gain on the sale. Also, in fiscal 2008, we completed the sale of our Power Systems business for $102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a
$51 million pre-tax gain on the sale.

See
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by
our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations
and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future. We may use excess cash to reduce our
outstanding debt levels, including through the possible repurchase of our public debt in accordance with applicable law, to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share
repurchase program, to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares, or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines. We intend to fund the acquisition of ADC with approximately
$1 billion of available cash and the remainder with funds available under our existing
Credit Facility or alternative borrowing sources, including the issuance of new notes or commercial paper. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We
will continue to monitor financial markets, to respond as necessary to changing conditions.

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,679 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to $1,378 million in fiscal 2009.
The increase of $301 million in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 primarily resulted from higher income levels, partially offset by increased working capital to support current business levels.

Net
cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $456 million to $1,378 million in fiscal 2009 from $922 million in fiscal 2008. The finalization of a
class action settlement in February 2008 resulted in a decrease to cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from investing activities of $936 million. Excluding the
class action settlement, net cash provided by continuing operating activities was lower in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower income levels partially offset by working
capital improvements.



Pension and postretirement benefit contributions in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, were $180 million, $145 million, and $77 million,
respectively. These amounts included voluntary pension contributions of $69 million and $61 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. We expect pension contributions to be
$70 million in fiscal 2011, before consideration of voluntary contributions.

The
amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, was $156 million, $121 million, and $359 million, respectively.

We continue to fund capital expenditures to support new programs and to invest in machinery and our manufacturing facilities to further enhance
productivity and manufacturing capabilities. Capital spending increased $57 million in fiscal 2010 to $385 million as compared to $328 million in fiscal 2009. Capital spending was
$610 million in fiscal 2008. We expect fiscal 2011 capital spending levels to be approximately 4 to 5% of net sales.

During
fiscal 2010, we acquired the remaining outstanding equity interests of PlanarMag for $23 million in cash and the forgiveness of an approximate $1 million loan
payable. Also, we acquired certain assets of the Optical Products Group of Zarlink for $15 million in cash. In addition, we acquired Sensitive Object for a purchase price of $67 million,
which includes $6 million of contingent consideration to be paid in fiscal 2011.

During
fiscal 2010, we received net cash proceeds of $3 million and $12 million related to the sale of the mechatronics business and the Dulmison connectors and fittings
product line, respectively.

In
fiscal 2009, we received net cash proceeds of $664 million related to the sale of our Wireless Systems business. Also, in fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds
related to working capital of $29 million in connection with the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystems and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses which occurred in fiscal 2008 and
$17 million primarily related to the divestiture of the Battery Systems business.

In
fiscal 2008, we received net cash proceeds of $102 million, $427 million, and $42 million related to the sale of the Power Systems, Radio Frequency Components and
Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses, respectively.



The
finalization of a class action settlement in fiscal 2008 resulted in an increase to cash flows from investing activities of $936 million, but did not affect the cash balance
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Total debt at fiscal year end 2010 and 2009 was $2,413 million and $2,417 million, respectively. See Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.

During
June 2009, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, commenced a tender offer to purchase up to $150 million principal amount of its 6.00%
senior notes due 2012, up to $100 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and up to $100 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037. On
July 7, 2009, the tender offer expired and on July 9, 2009, TEGSA purchased and cancelled $86 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, $42 million
principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $23 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037 for an aggregate payment of $141 million, plus paid accrued
interest through July 7, 2009 of $3 million to the sellers of the notes. As a result of the transaction, in fiscal 2009, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million,
which is included in other income, including the write-off of unamortized discounts and fees of $1 million and the recognition of a gain of $12 million associated with
terminated interest rate swaps previously designated as fair value hedges. Additionally, as a result of the re-purchase and cancellation, unamortized losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income of $3 million related to terminated starting forward interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were recognized as interest expense.

In
April 2007, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"). In fiscal 2009, $75 million of the commitment was
assigned by Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB to TEGSA, reducing the total effective commitment to $1,425 million. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at TEGSA's option, at a base rate
or the London interbank offered rate plus a margin dependent on TEGSA's credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5
basis points depending on its credit ratings. As of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility.

Our
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in
the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.5 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered under the
Credit Facility. The



Credit
Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of September 24, 2010, we were
in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.

Periodically,
TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper
program are backed by the Credit Facility. As of fiscal year end 2010, TEGSA had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding at an interest rate of 0.55%.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco Electronics Ltd.

Payments
of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders were $289 million, $294 million, and $271 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008,
respectively. In October 2009, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.34 (equivalent to
$0.32) per share, payable in two equal installments in each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. We paid the first and second installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share
each during the quarters ended December 25, 2009 and March 26, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24) to
CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92).

In
March 2010, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.72 (equivalent to
$0.64) per share, payable in four equal installments in each quarter beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 through the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We paid the first and second installments
of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters ended June 25, 2010 and September 24, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares
from CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92) to CHF 1.73 (equivalent to $1.60). The remaining distributions will be paid in U.S. Dollars at a rate of $0.16 per share for each of the first and
second quarters of fiscal 2011. Future distributions or dividends on our common shares, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders
that such distributions or dividends be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of
applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant.

Our
board of directors has approved a recommendation that our shareholders be asked to approve, at the 2011 annual general meeting of shareholders expected to be held in March 2011, a
dividend to shareholders to be paid in four equal installments each at a rate of $0.18 per share in each quarter beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 through the second quarter of fiscal
2012. Such proposed quarterly dividends will not be finalized unless and until approved by our shareholders.

During
fiscal 2010, we purchased approximately 18 million of our common shares for $488 million. In fiscal 2009, we purchased approximately 6 million of our common
shares for $125 million and also settled purchases of $27 million of our common shares which occurred prior to the end of fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately
37 million of our common shares for $1,269 million, of which $1,242 million was paid as of September 26, 2008. Since inception of the share repurchase program, which had an
authorization of $2.0 billion at September 24, 2010, we have purchased approximately 61 million shares for $1,882 million. On September 29, 2010, our board of
directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program from $2.0 billion to $2.75 billion.

(4)

The
table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make
contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type,
including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $70 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2011,
before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Other
long-term liabilities of $452 million, of which $205 million related to our ASC 460 liability, are excluded from the table

Income Tax Matters

In connection with the separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidien's, Tyco Electronics', and
Tyco International's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a
result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning
of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code.

Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco
International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain
contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities
settled in cash by Tyco Electronics with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and
Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a
portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party



or
parties' obligation. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are
responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

Prior
to separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by
various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income tax audit
controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related
interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, which relate specifically to Tyco Electronics entities, have been recorded on the Consolidated Financial
Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Covidien and Tyco International's tax obligations. Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated
Financial Statements. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In
prior years, in connection with the IRS audit of various fiscal years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax
returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. The IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments for fiscal 1997 through 2000 for which the IRS had completed its
field work. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, we have determined that acceptance of adjustments presented for additional periods through fiscal 2006 is more likely than not to be
accepted and, accordingly, have recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
fiscal 2009, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns were completed by Tyco International and in connection with these adjustments, we recorded a
$97 million increase in income tax liabilities, a $10 million increase in deferred tax assets, a $60 million increase in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in
connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, and a $27 million charge to contributed surplus. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
indemnification liability to Tyco International and Covidien.

As
our tax return positions continue to be updated for periods prior to separation, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. While
the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on our results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows. Additionally, adjustments may be recorded to shareholders' equity in the future for the impact of filing final or amended income tax returns in certain
jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien, and/or our subsidiaries for the periods prior to the separation.

During
fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue Agent
Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period. Tyco International has appealed certain proposed adjustments totaling approximately
$1 billion. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers
of stock in 1998 and 1999. Based upon statutory guidelines, Tyco International estimates the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million, and it is our
understanding that Tyco International is vigorously opposing the assertion of any such penalties. The penalty is asserted against a prior subsidiary of Tyco International that was distributed to Tyco
Electronics in connection with the separation. Any penalty ultimately imposed upon the Tyco Electronics subsidiary would be subject to sharing with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax
Sharing Agreement. It is our understanding that Tyco



International
has made progress during fiscal 2010 towards resolving a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000; however, several significant matters remain
in dispute. The primary issues in dispute involve the tax treatment of certain intercompany transactions. If Tyco International is not able to resolve these contested adjustments through the IRS
appeals process, it may choose to litigate the disputed issues. In addition, Tyco International could settle with the IRS and pay any related deficiencies for the undisputed tax adjustments within the
next twelve months.

The
IRS continues to audit certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 and is nearing completion of its fieldwork for this period. It is possible that
the audit for the years 2001 through 2004 will conclude within the next twelve months. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Tyco International settled a matter with the IRS concerning certain tax
deductions claimed on Tyco International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004. As a result of this settlement, we recorded a $28 million income tax charge in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2009 to reflect the disallowance of a portion of these deductions.

We
have reflected $244 million of liabilities related to the audits of Tyco International's income tax returns for 1997 through 2000 and 2001 through 2004 in accrued and other
current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within one year. It is anticipated that the IRS will commence its audit of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years
2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011.

We
continue to believe that the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution is
uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Legal Matters

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims,
antitrust claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, and other commercial disputes. Management believes that these legal proceedings and
claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable
law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows in a future period. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.

Matters Related to Our Former Wireless Systems Business

Certain liabilities and contingencies related to our former Wireless Systems business were retained by us when this business was sold
in fiscal 2009. These include certain retained liabilities related to the State of New York contract and a contingent purchase price commitment related to the acquisition of Com-Net by the
Wireless Systems business in 2001. See additional information below. Also, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the
Wireless Systems business.



State of New York Contract

On September 19, 2005, our former Wireless Systems business was awarded a twenty-year lease contract with the State
of New York to construct, operate, and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders. On August 29, 2008, we were served by the State with
a default notice related to the first regional network, pursuant to the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the State. On
October 16, 2008, we informed the State that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system
ready for testing. The State conducted further testing during November and December 2008. On January 15, 2009, the State notified us that, in the State's opinion, we had not fully remediated
the issues cited by the State and it had determined that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract. The State contends that it has the right
under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the State in conjunction with the implementation of the network, and as a result of this contention, on January 16, 2009, the State drew down
$50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit, although
we dispute that the State has any basis to do so.

On
February 13, 2009, we filed a claim in the New York Court of Claims, seeking over $100 million in damages, and alleging a number of causes of action, including breach of
contract, unjust enrichment, defamation, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the imposition of a constructive trust, and seeking a declaration that the State terminated
the contract "for convenience." In September 2009, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint, with the exception of the breach of contract claims. In November 2009,
the State filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim asserting breach of contract and alleging that the State has incurred damages in excess of $275 million. We moved to dismiss the
counterclaim in February 2010, and in June 2010 the Court denied our motion. We filed our answer to the State's counterclaim in July 2010. We believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend
to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter.

As
a result of these actions, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $111 million associated with this contract. These charges are
reflected in loss from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of our sale of the Wireless Systems business. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations and the sale of the Wireless Systems business. The charges included an impairment charge of $61 million to write-off all
costs incurred in constructing the network as well as a charge equal to the amount drawn by the State against the standby letter of credit of $50 million. The assets related to the impairment
charge were previously reflected primarily as inventories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Com-Net

At September 24, 2010, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001
acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system
for the State of Florida is finished and the State of Florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not
believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania,
which is in the motion pleading and discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable
or estimable at this time.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and
financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2011 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of
nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks
involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities
and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have
no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

As
of September 24, 2010, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $390 million, of which $50 million was related to our
contract with the State of New York.

We
have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of
these liabilities.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, except for the charges related to the contract with the
State of New York discussed below, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
January 2009, the State of New York drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge
equal to the draw. Although we dispute that the State has any basis to do so, the State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit which could
result in additional charges and could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco
International and
Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities
relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us
with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of
certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to
default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These arrangements have been valued
upon our separation from Tyco International in accordance with ASC 460 and, accordingly, liabilities amounting to $339 million were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
September 24, 2010. See Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

We
generally record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding estimated product
warranty.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant
accounting policies are summarized in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following noted accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made
by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with ASC 605,

Revenue Recognition

,
and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 101 and 104.

Our
revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the
customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For
those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience
and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on
historical experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Contract
revenues for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are
based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs.
Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they
first become determinable. Contract revenues for construction related projects are generated primarily within our Subsea Communications segment.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value, except for inventoried costs which are costs incurred in the performance
of long-term contracts primarily by our Subsea Communications segment. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based upon product demand and historical experience.
Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a
determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years that are
amortized generally on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis and when events and
circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets. Goodwill is
assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal
quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of
factors including operating results, business plans,



economic
projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them to the
analysis of goodwill impairment.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in ASC 350,

Intangibles—Goodwill and Other

. First, we
perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting
unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we
compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We
allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any
excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Estimates
about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting
unit. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates,
discount rates, and income tax rates in assessing fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.

We
completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and determined that no impairment existed and that the fair value of all reporting units to which
goodwill is allocated is well in excess of the respective carrying value.

Income Taxes

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments
affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and
financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and international
pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment
about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in
the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax
assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Prior to September 26,
2009, if a change in a valuation allowance occurred, which was established in connection with an acquisition, the adjustment of such



allowance
may have affected goodwill rather than the income tax provision. Subsequent to the adoption of the business combination provisions of ASC 805,

Business
Combinations

, on September 26, 2009, any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition, regardless of when the acquisition
occurred, will be reflected in the income tax provision.

Changes
in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we
conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related
interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and
related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax
payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the
ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised
by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income
tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. These tax liabilities and related interest
are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our defined benefit pension and
postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the
measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon
retirement based on estimated future compensation levels. For the postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the
actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and
participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trust funds. Our contribution amounts are actuarially determined.

Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a
systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants.

Two
critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at
least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual
results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the
expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point
decrease in the discount rate would increase our



present
value of pension obligations by $127 million, while a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our present value of pension obligations by $122 million. We
consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long-term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by
$9 million, while a 50 basis point increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would decrease our pension expense by $9 million.

During
fiscal 2008, our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. plans' master trust from 60% equity and 40% fixed income to 30% equity
and 70% fixed income in an effort to better align asset risk with the anticipated payment of benefit obligations. The target asset allocation transition began in fiscal 2008. As of
September 24, 2010, our actual asset allocation is approximately 45% equity and 55% fixed income. Asset reallocation will continue over a multi-year period based on the funded
status of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions.

Share-Based Compensation

Under ASC 718,

Compensation—Stock Compensation

, we determine the fair value
of share awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires certain assumptions that involve judgment. Such assumptions are the
expected share price volatility, expected annual dividend yield, expected life of options, and risk-free interest rate. (See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information related to share-based compensation.) An increase in the volatility of our stock will increase the amount of compensation expense on new awards. An increase in the holding
period of options will also cause an increase in compensation expense. Dividend yields and risk-free interest rates are less difficult to estimate, but an increase in the dividend yield
will cause a decrease in expense and an increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.

Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued updates to the guidance in ASC 715,

Compensation—Retirement
Benefits

, that enhance disclosures regarding assets in defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The
updates to ASC 715 are effective for us in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to fair value measurement
of assets in defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans.

In
April 2009 and December 2007, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 805,

Business Combinations

, addressing the recognition and accounting for
identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in business combinations. We adopted the business combination provisions on September 26, 2009. Adoption did not
have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810,

Consolidation

, that address the accounting and reporting framework for
noncontrolling interests by a parent company. We adopted the updates on September 26, 2009. As a result of adopting the presentation requirements related to noncontrolling interests, we
retrospectively adjusted our Consolidated Financial Statements. Adoption of the accounting requirements for noncontrolling interests did not have a material impact on our results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows.



In
September 2006, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

, and ASC 825,

Financial Instruments,

that defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, expands disclosure about fair value measurements, and
introduces the fair value option for certain financial assets and liabilities. We adopted the fair value provisions of ASC 820 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We have not elected the fair value
option of ASC 825 for any eligible assets or
liabilities. Prior to adoption, the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for non-financial assets and liabilities were deferred by one year. We adopted the fair value
provisions of ASC 820 for non-financial assets and liabilities on September 26, 2009. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related
to fair value measurements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810 that address accounting for variable interest entities. These updates to
ASC 810 are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

•

The impact of certain provisions of our articles of association on unsolicited takeover proposals.

There
may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated
with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements. We utilize established risk management
policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks.

We
do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are
limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long-term debt rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty.

Foreign Currency Exposures

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we use foreign currency forward and swap contracts. The
objective is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany transactions, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other cash
transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the September 24, 2010 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $12 million, while a 10%
depreciation of the U.S. Dollar would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $15 million. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the September 25, 2009 market
rates would have decreased the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $2 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar would have increased the unrealized value of our forward
contracts by $2 million. Such gains or losses on these contracts would be generally offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions.



Interest Rate and Investment Exposures

We issue debt, from time to time, in capital and money markets to fund our operations and capital needs. Such borrowings can result in
interest rate exposure. To manage the interest rate exposure and to minimize overall interest cost, we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into variable rate
debt (via fair value hedge designation) and/or convert a portion of variable rate debt into fixed-rate debt (via cash flow hedge designation). We use forward starting interest rate swaps
and swaptions to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt (via cash flow hedge designation). We also utilize interest rate swap and
swaption contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges, to manage interest rate exposure on cash and cash equivalents, and we utilize a swap to manage exposure related to certain of
our non-qualified deferred compensation liabilities.

During
fiscal 2010, we purchased options to enter into interest rate swaps ("swaptions") and entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure prior to
the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt when our 6.00% senior notes mature in fiscal 2012. The swaptions and forward starting interest rate swaps are based on a total notional amount of
$400 million. Also during fiscal 2010, we entered into an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge on $50 million principal amount of the 6.00% senior notes. Based on our
floating rate debt balance of
$150 million at September 24, 2010, an increase in the levels of the U.S. Dollar interest rates by 0.5%, with all other variables held constant, would result in an increase of annual
interest expense of approximately $1 million. At September 25, 2009, we had no floating rate debt outstanding.

Commodity Exposures

Our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the effects of
fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows, we utilize commodity swap contracts, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges. We continually evaluate the
commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next twelve to twenty-four months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts in order to hedge a
portion of usage requirements over that period. At September 24, 2010, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold and silver, were in a gain position of
$12 million and had a notional value of $108 million. At September 25, 2009, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, were in a gain position of
$1 million and had a notional value of $29 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold and a troy ounce of silver from the September 24, 2010
prices would change the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $12 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold from the September 25, 2009
prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $3 million.

Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on financial instruments.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 24, 2010. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 24, 2010.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 24, 2010.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of
September 24, 2010, which is included in this Annual Report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the quarter ended September 24, 2010, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tyco Electronics Ltd.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 24, 2010 and September 25,
2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2010. Our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 24, 2010 and
September 25, 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
September 24, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 10, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tyco Electronics Ltd.:

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 24, 2010, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on that risk, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2010, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule of the Company as of and for the year ended September 24, 2010, and our report dated November 10, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule.

Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics" or the "Company") is a leading global provider of engineered electronic components, network solutions, specialty products, and subsea
communication systems.

The Separation

Tyco Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of then Bermuda-based Tyco
International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). For the period following its incorporation, Tyco Electronics Ltd. did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal
assets. Effective June 29, 2007, the Company became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International. On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of
its shares of Tyco Electronics, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders (the "separation").

Change of Domicile

Effective June 25, 2009, the Company discontinued its existence as a Bermuda company as provided in Section 132G of The
Companies Act of 1981 of Bermuda, as
amended (the "Bermuda Companies Act"), and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued its existence as a Swiss corporation under
articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations (the "Change of Domicile"). The rights of holders of the Company's shares are governed by Swiss law, the Company's Swiss articles of
association, and the Company's Swiss organizational regulations.

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and its subsidiaries and have
been prepared in United States Dollars in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in
these Consolidated Financial Statements include restructuring and other charges, acquisition assets and liabilities, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future cash flows and
discount rates associated with asset impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, estimated contract revenue and related costs,
legal contingencies, tax reserves and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension and postretirement employee benefit expenses.
Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Principles of Consolidation

The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or controls more than fifty percent of the voting shares or otherwise has the
ability to control through similar rights. In addition, the Company consolidates variable interest entities in which the Company bears a majority of the risk to the entities'

2. Correction of Immaterial Errors

During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company identified certain errors in its accounting for income taxes. These errors related to the adoption of the uncertain tax position
provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, in fiscal 2008 and data utilized in the determination of the Company's income tax provision in fiscal 2005 through
fiscal 2009.

In
connection with the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, the Company failed to reflect, in the calculation of interest and penalties, the impact of the
interest component of a prepayment made to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") in fiscal 2007. As a result of this error, the Company overstated deferred tax assets, receivable from Tyco
International Ltd. and Covidien plc, noncurrent income taxes payable, and other income by $64 million, $81 million, $182 million, and $81 million,
respectively, and understated accumulated earnings by $118 million in fiscal 2008. The impacts to other income and receivable from Tyco International Ltd. and Covidien plc result
from the shared nature of the tax liabilities pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement entered into upon separation from Tyco International.

The
Company also identified errors in certain reports used, in part, to determine the Company's income tax provision in fiscal 2005 through 2009. As a result of these errors, the Company
understated income tax expense and overstated deferred tax assets by $9 million and $14 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Also, contributed surplus and accumulated earnings
were overstated by $30 million and $4 million, respectively, at September 29, 2007, the beginning of fiscal 2008, as a result of the errors. For periods prior to the Company's
separation from Tyco International, the impact of the errors was charged to contributed surplus.

The
Company evaluated the effects of these errors individually and in the aggregate and determined that its prior period financial statements are not materially misstated. However, the
Company determined that the cumulative effect of correcting these errors in fiscal 2010 would be material to the fiscal 2010 financial statements. Therefore, the Company corrected these errors in the
affected prior periods and presented the results in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

The Company's revenues are generated principally from the sale of its products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the
time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed
and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, the Company has deferred the recognition of revenue.

The
Company provides certain distributors with an inventory allowance for returns or scrap equal to a percentage of qualified purchases. A reserve for estimated returns and scrap
allowances is established at the time of the sale based on a fixed percentage of sales to distributors authorized and agreed to by the Company and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Other
allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is
recorded as a reduction of sales. The Company believes it can reasonably and reliably estimate the amounts of future allowances.

Contract
revenues for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are
based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs.
Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they
first become determinable. Contract revenues for construction related projects are generated primarily in the Company's Subsea Communications segment.

The
Company generally warrants that its products will conform to the Company's or mutually agreed to specifications and that its products will be free from material defects in materials
and workmanship for a limited time. The Company limits its warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. The Company accepts
returned goods only when the customer makes a verified claim and the Company has authorized the return. Returns result primarily from defective products or shipping discrepancies. A reserve for
estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Additionally,
certain of the Company's long-term contracts in its Subsea Communications segment have warranty obligations. Estimated warranty costs for each contract are
determined based on the contract terms and technology-specific considerations. These costs are included in total estimated contract costs and are accrued over the construction period of the respective
contracts under percentage-of-completion accounting.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in research, development, and engineering expenses.
Research and development expenses
include salaries, direct costs incurred, building, and overhead expenses. The amounts expensed in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $482 million, $439 million, and $482 million,
respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the Company's outstanding
receivables determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, and other currently available evidence.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market value, except for inventoried
costs which are costs incurred in the performance of long-term contracts primarily by the Company's Subsea Communications segment.

Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net and Long-Lived Assets

Net property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged
to expense when incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Buildings and related improvements

5 to 40 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of remaining term of the lease or economic useful life

Machinery and equipment

1 to 15 years

The Company periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment and
amortizable intangible assets, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. When indicators of potential
impairment are present, the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business. An impairment
in the carrying value of an asset group is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value. The amount of impairment
recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows
and discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a
determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years that are
amortized generally on a straight-line basis. See Note 10 for additional information regarding intangible assets. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets
with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. The Company assesses intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment
consistent with its policy for



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

assessing
other long-lived assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting
unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever the Company believes a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing
the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market
place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.

At
fiscal year end 2010, the Company had 9 reporting units, of which 7 contained goodwill. See Note 9 for information regarding goodwill impairment testing. When changes occur in
the composition of one or more operating segments or reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, the Company performs a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, the Company compares the fair value of a
reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the
amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the
carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is
determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and
liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to
its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Estimates
about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting
unit. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates,
discount rates, and income tax rates in assessing fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

.
In the Consolidated Financial Statements, the benefits of a consolidated return have been reflected where such returns have or could be filed based on the entities and jurisdictions included in the
financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred
tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss carryforwards using tax rates in effect for
the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Financial Instruments

In order to address certain financial exposures, the Company has established policies regarding the use of derivative and
non-derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, and commodity risks.

The
Company accounts for derivative financial instrument contracts on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. For instruments not designated as hedges under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, the
changes in the instruments' fair value are recognized currently in earnings. For instruments designated as cash flow
hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
underlying hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions, including amounts excluded from the hedging relationship, of a cash flow hedge are recognized currently in earnings. Changes in the fair
value of instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or liability hedged, with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability being
recognized in earnings.

The
Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments by using methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date.
Standard market conventions are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, including derivatives.

The
cash flows related to derivative financial instruments are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The
Company's derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks; however, concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated as the Company deals with financial
institutions worldwide, substantially all of which have long-term Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, only conventional
derivative financial instruments are utilized. The Company is exposed to potential losses if a counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of its agreement. With respect to counterparty net
asset positions recognized at September 24, 2010, the Company has assessed the likelihood of counterparty default as remote. The Company currently provides guarantees from a wholly-owned
subsidiary to the counterparties to its commodity swap derivatives. The likelihood of performance on those guarantees has been assessed as remote. For all other derivative instruments, the Company is
not required, nor does it require, collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments, at this time.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

The funded status of the Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit
obligation is the projected benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on estimated future compensation levels. For the
postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to
employee services already rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents the



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

current
market value of cumulative Company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trust funds. The
Company's contribution amounts are actuarially determined.

Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a
systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants.

The
measurement of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost (credit) is based on estimates and assumptions determined by the Company's management. These valuations reflect the
terms of the plans and use participant-specific information such as compensation, age, and years of service, as well as certain assumptions, including estimates of discount rates, expected return on
plan assets, rate of compensation increases, interest crediting rates, and mortality rates.

Share-Based Compensation

Under ASC 718,

Compensation—Stock Compensation

, the Company determines the
fair value of share awards on the date of grant. Share options are valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model; restricted share awards are valued using the
end-of-day share price of the Company on the date of grant. That fair value is expensed ratably over the expected service period, with an allowance made for estimated
forfeitures based on historical employee activity. See Note 23 for additional information related to the Company's share-based compensation.

Currency Translation

For the Company's non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars
using fiscal year end exchange rates. Sales and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the fiscal year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income within equity.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, which are included in net income (loss) attributable to Tyco Electronics Ltd., were immaterial in fiscal 2010 and
2008. Such losses were $71 million during fiscal 2009.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued updates to the guidance in ASC 715,

Compensation—Retirement
Benefits

, that enhance disclosures regarding assets in defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The
updates to ASC 715 are effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. See Note 17 for additional information related to fair value measurement of assets in defined benefit
pension or other postretirement plans.

In

Loss on Divestitures and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

During fiscal 2010, the Company sold its mechatronics business within the Company's Electronic Components segment for net cash proceeds
of $3 million. This business designs and manufactures customer-specific components, primarily for the automotive industry, and generated sales of approximately $100 million in fiscal
2010. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $41 million in fiscal 2010.

During
fiscal 2009, the Company's board of directors authorized management to pursue the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line within the Company's energy
business in the Network Solutions segment. The product line generated sales of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2009. Based on an estimated sales price, the Company determined that the
carrying value of the product line's assets and liabilities was in excess of its fair value. A pre-tax impairment charge of $12 million was recorded in fiscal 2009 to write the
carrying value of the assets and liabilities down to fair value. During fiscal 2010, the Company completed the sale of the product line for net cash proceeds of $12 million. In connection with
the divestiture, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge related to long-lived assets and a pre-tax loss on sale of $12 million and
$1 million, respectively, in fiscal 2010.

During
fiscal 2008, the Company's board of directors authorized management to proceed with strategic alternatives with respect to the Company's Battery Systems business in the Electronic
Components segment. Based on a negotiated sales price, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Battery Systems business' assets and liabilities exceeded its fair value. Consequently, a



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

4. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net (Continued)

pre-tax
impairment charge of $22 million was recorded in fiscal 2008 to write the carrying value of the assets and liabilities down to fair value. During fiscal 2009, the Battery
Systems business was sold for net cash proceeds of $14 million after working capital adjustments, and the Company recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $7 million.

During
fiscal 2008, the Company determined that certain North American automotive customer-specific product lines in the Electronic Components segment were impaired due to declining
future production expectations. The Company determined that an impairment test was necessary due to changes in the North American automotive industry. These asset groups were assessed for
recoverability and impaired based on estimates of the asset group fair values. Using a discounted cash flows analysis, the Company determined that a pre-tax impairment charge of
$12 million was required to write the carrying value down to fair value.

The
loss on divestitures and impairment charges are presented in restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company has presented the loss on
divestitures, related long-lived asset impairments, and the operations of the mechatronics business, Dulmison connectors and fittings product line, and Battery Systems business in
continuing operations due to immateriality.

5. Discontinued Operations

In fiscal 2010, the Company recorded income from discontinued operations of $44 million primarily in
connection with the favorable resolution of certain litigation contingencies related to the Printed Circuit Group business which was sold in fiscal 2007.

In
May 2009, the Company completed the sale of the Wireless Systems business for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million
on the transaction.

In
September 2008, the Company completed the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for net cash proceeds of $427 million and recorded a $184 million
pre-tax gain on the sale. Also, in September 2008, the Company completed the sale of the Automotive Radar Sensors business for net cash proceeds of $42 million and recorded a
$31 million pre-tax gain on the sale. In fiscal 2009, the Company received additional cash proceeds of $29 million and recognized an additional pre-tax gain on
sale of $4 million in connection with the finalization of working capital adjustments related to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors
businesses.

In
fiscal 2008, the Company completed the sale of the Power Systems business for $102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $51 million pre-tax gain on
the sale.

The
Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, Automotive Radar Sensors, Power Systems, and Printed Circuit Group businesses met the held for sale and discontinued
operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to held for sale and discontinued
operations, the Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses were components of the former Wireless Systems segment. The Power Systems and
Printed Circuit Group businesses were components of the Other segment, which was subsequently renamed the Subsea Communications segment.

for fiscal 2009 included $68 million relating to the impact of $319 million of goodwill written off in connection with the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business, for which a tax
benefit was not fully realized, as well as $35 million of unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax provision on the Power Systems business as a result of the finalization of the tax basis
of assets sold upon the filing of the fiscal 2008 income tax returns.

6. Acquisitions

On August 6, 2010, the Company acquired the remaining outstanding equity interests of PlanarMag, Inc. ("PlanarMag") for $23 million in cash and the forgiveness of an
approximate $1 million loan payable. Prior to the acquisition, the Company owned approximately 14% of PlanarMag. The acquisition was not material to the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The
net assets acquired, which are not material, are reported as part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions business within the Electronic Components segment. The excess of the
purchase price over the net assets acquired of $25 million has been allocated to goodwill in the Electronic Components segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. Factors contributing to
the goodwill recognized include the early-stage status of PlanarMag's business and technology, minimal revenue, and lack of customer relationships.

On
May 14, 2010, the Company acquired certain assets of the Optical Products Group of Zarlink Semiconductor Inc. for $15 million in cash. The assets acquired,
primarily definite-lived intangible assets, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment, are reported as part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions business within the Electronic Components
segment. The acquisition was not material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

On
January 20, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Sensitive Object, an early-stage software company engaged in developing touch-enabling
technology focused on computers, mobile devices, and consumer electronics, for a purchase price of approximately $67 million in cash, including contingent consideration of $6 million to
be paid in fiscal 2011 upon completion of certain service requirements by key Sensitive Object managers. Based on an evaluation



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

6. Acquisitions (Continued)

of
the range of outcomes for this contingent consideration, the maximum amount payable, on an undiscounted basis, would be $7 million.

The
Sensitive Object acquisition complements the Company's existing Touch Systems business, which is primarily focused on commercial and industrial markets. Sensitive Object is reported
as part of the Touch Systems business within the Specialty Products segment.

The
Sensitive Object transaction is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 805,

The amortizable intangible assets include developed technology, patents, and reacquired rights having useful lives of eight years and will be
amortized based on their contributions to earnings. Also included in amortizable intangible assets are customer contracts and related relationships that will be amortized on a
straight-line basis over their expected life of five years. Due to immateriality, no amounts have been allocated to in-process research and development.

Approximately
$51 million has been allocated to goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. Factors
contributing to the recognized goodwill are low revenue levels in the years immediately following the acquisition reflecting the early-stage status of Sensitive Object's technology and the amount of
future investment required to develop a commercially viable product. Goodwill related to this acquisition is reported in the Specialty Products segment and is not deductible for tax purposes.

Pro
forma information is not presented as the impact of the Sensitive Object acquisition on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations is not material.

Anticipated Acquisition

On July 12, 2010, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with ADC
Telecommunications, Inc. ("ADC") under which the Company agreed to acquire ADC for a total purchase price of approximately $1.25 billion. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company
commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of ADC common stock at a purchase price of $12.75 per share in cash followed by a merger with and into ADC. The initial
offer, dated July 26, 2010, has been extended to November 15, 2010. As



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

6. Acquisitions (Continued)

of
October 18, 2010, approximately 86.5 million common shares of ADC had been tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the tender offer, representing approximately 89% of the outstanding
common shares of ADC. In accordance with the terms of the tender offer, ADC shareholders have the right to withdraw their previously tendered shares prior to the expiration of the offer.

The
transaction is expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The consummation of the transaction is subject to various closing conditions including the tender of
a majority of ADC's shares, regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions. The Merger Agreement also includes customary termination provisions for both ADC and the Company and provides that, in
connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, ADC will be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $38 million.

During fiscal 2010, the Company completed the acquisitions of PlanarMag and Sensitive Object. The PlanarMag and Sensitive Object acquisitions
resulted in the recognition of $25 million of goodwill that benefits the Communications and Industrial Solutions reporting unit of the Electronic Components segment and $51 million of
goodwill that benefits the Touch Systems reporting unit of the Specialty Products segment. See Note 6 for additional information on the acquisitions of PlanarMag and Sensitive Object.

The
Company tests goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances exist that indicate that a reporting unit's
carrying value may exceed its fair value. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and determined that no impairment existed.

As
a result of declines in sales and profitability in the Automotive and Communications and Industrial Solutions reporting units of the Electronic Components segment and the Circuit
Protection reporting unit of the Specialty Products segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company
determined that an indicator of impairment had occurred and goodwill impairment testing of these reporting units was required. Significant judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of
impairment has occurred. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including, among others, operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future
cash flows. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

9. Goodwill (Continued)

The
testing for goodwill impairment is a two step process. In performing step I of impairment testing, the Company determined the fair value of the Automotive, Communications and
Industrial Solutions, and Circuit Protection reporting units based on a discounted cash flows analysis incorporating the Company's estimate of future operating performance. The results of the step I
goodwill impairment tests indicated that the book value of each of the reporting units exceeded its fair value. The failure of the step I goodwill impairment tests triggered step II goodwill
impairment tests in which the Company determined the implied fair value of the reporting units' goodwill by comparing the reporting units' fair value determined in step I to the fair value of the
reporting units' net assets, including unrecognized intangible assets. The step II goodwill impairment tests resulted in a full impairment charge, as of the second quarter of fiscal 2009, of
$2,088 million for the Automotive reporting unit and partial impairment charges of $1,347 million and $112 million for the Communications and Industrial Solutions and Circuit
Protection reporting units, respectively.

During
the fiscal 2008 annual impairment test, the Company determined that the book value of the Global Application Tooling Division, a reporting unit of the Electronic Components
segment, exceeded its fair value. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flows analysis incorporating the Company's estimate of future operating performance. The goodwill impairment test
indicated that there was no implied value related to the goodwill, resulting in an impairment of the reporting unit's entire goodwill balance of $103 million.

All
goodwill impairment charges are presented in impairment of goodwill on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

During June 2009, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, commenced a tender offer to purchase up
to $150 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, up to $100 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and up to $100 million principal
amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037. On July 7, 2009, the tender offer expired and on July 9, 2009, TEGSA purchased and cancelled $86 million principal amount of its 6.00%
senior notes due 2012, $42 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $23 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037 for an aggregate payment of
$141 million, plus paid accrued interest through July 7, 2009 of $3 million to the sellers of the notes. As a result of the transaction, in fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a
pre-tax gain of $22 million, which is included in other income, including the write-off of unamortized discounts and fees of $1 million and the recognition of a
gain of $12 million associated with terminated interest rate swaps previously designated as fair value hedges. Additionally, as a result of the re-purchase and cancellation,
unamortized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income of $3 million related to terminated starting forward interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were recognized as interest
expense.

In
April 2007, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"). In fiscal 2009, $75 million of the commitment was
assigned by Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB to TEGSA, reducing the total effective commitment to $1,425 million. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at TEGSA's option, at a base rate
or the London interbank offered rate plus a margin dependent on TEGSA's credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. TEGSA
is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points depending on its credit ratings. As of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility.

The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if the Company's ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as
defined in the



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

12. Debt (Continued)

Credit
Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.5 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered under the
Credit Facility. The Credit Facility and the Company's other debt agreements contain other customary covenants.

Periodically,
TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of the Company's ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial
paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. As of fiscal year end 2010, TEGSA had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding at an interest rate of 0.55%.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco Electronics Ltd.

The
Company has used, and continues to use, derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. See Note 15 for additional information on options to enter into interest rate
swaps ("swaptions"), forward starting interest rate swaps, and interest rate swaps.

The
fair value of the Company's debt was approximately $2,680 million and $2,420 million at fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, respectively.

International's shareholders. These agreements govern the relationships among Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company subsequent to the separation and provide for the allocation to the Company
and Covidien of certain of Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to the separation.

Under
the Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements, subject to certain exceptions contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company, Covidien, and Tyco International
assumed 31%, 42%, and 27%, respectively, of certain of Tyco International's contingent and other

corporate
liabilities. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities are shared equally among the parties. These contingent and other
corporate liabilities primarily relate to consolidated securities litigation and any actions with respect to the separation or the distribution brought by any third party. If any party responsible for
such liabilities were to default in its payment, when due, of any of these assumed obligations, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other
non-defaulting party the amounts in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, Tyco Electronics may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed-upon share of
the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities, including associated costs and expenses.

Tax Sharing Agreement

Upon separation, the Company entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, under which the Company shares responsibility for certain of its,
Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. The Company, Covidien, and Tyco International share 31%,
42%, and 27%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to its, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns. The effect of the
Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify the Company for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the Company with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that
indemnification, the Company has made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved
pre-separation tax matters. All
costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. The Company is responsible for all of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant
to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing
formula.

All
of the tax liabilities of Tyco International that were associated with Tyco International subsidiaries that are included in Tyco Electronics following the separation became Tyco
Electronics' tax liabilities upon separation. Although Tyco Electronics has agreed to share certain tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco
Electronics remains primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco International and Covidien default on their obligations to Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco Electronics
would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law
for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed upon share of its, Tyco
International's, and Covidien's tax liabilities.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Guarantees (Continued)

Indemnification

The Company's indemnification created under the Tax Sharing Agreement qualifies as a guarantee of a third party entity's debt under ASC
460,

Guarantees

. ASC 460 addresses the measurement and disclosure of a guarantor's obligation to pay a debt incurred by a third party. To value the
initial guarantee obligation, the Company considered a range of probability-weighted future cash flows that represented the likelihood of payment of each class of liability by each of the three
post-separation companies. The expected cash flows incorporated interest and penalties that the companies believed would be incurred on each class of liabilities and were discounted to the
present value to reflect the value associated with each at separation. The calculation of the guarantee liability also included a premium that reflected the cost for an insurance carrier to stand in
and assume the payment obligation at the separation date.

At
inception of the guarantee, based on the probability-weighted future cash flows related to unresolved tax matters, the Company, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, faced a maximum
potential liability of $3 billion, based on undiscounted estimates and interest and penalties used to determine the fair value of the guarantee and an assumption of 100% default on the parts of
Tyco International and Covidien, a likelihood that management believes to be remote. In the event that the Company is required, due to bankruptcy or other business interruption on the part of Tyco
International or Covidien, to pay more than the contractually determined 31%, the Company retains the right to seek payment from the effected entity.

At
September 24, 2010, the Company had a liability representing the indemnifications made to Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement of
$339 million, of which $205 million was reflected in other liabilities and $134 million was reflected in accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The $134 million reflected in accrued and other current liabilities is the Company's estimated cash obligation under the Tax Sharing Agreement to Tyco International and Covidien in connection
with pre-separation tax matters that could be resolved within one year. At September 25, 2009, the total liability of $339 million was reflected in other liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has assessed the probable future cash payments to Tyco International and Covidien for pre-separation income tax matters pursuant to the terms of the
Tax Sharing Agreement and determined this amount remains sufficient to satisfy these expected obligations.

Other Matters

In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks
including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and
manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such
indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions; however, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At
September 24, 2010, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $390 million, of which $50 million was related to its
contract with the State of New York. See Note 14 for additional information regarding the State of New York contract.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Guarantees (Continued)

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, except for the charges related to the contract with
the State of New York discussed below, such obligations will not significantly affect the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

As
disclosed in Note 14, in January 2009, the State of New York (the "State") drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by the Company.
As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge equal to the draw. Although the Company disputes that the State has any basis to do so, the State has the ability to draw up to an
additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit which could result in additional charges and could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

The
Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. The changes in the Company's warranty liability for fiscal 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

Tyco Electronics Legal Proceedings

Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation

The Company is a party to a number of patent infringement and antitrust actions that may require the Company to pay damage awards. The
Company has assessed the status of these matters and has recorded liabilities related to certain of these matters where appropriate.

Other Matters

The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions,
and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows.

Legal Matters under Separation and Distribution Agreement

The Separation and Distribution Agreement among the Company, Tyco International and Covidien provided for the allocation among the
parties of Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to the Company's and Covidien's separations from Tyco International on June 29, 2007. Under
the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters at separation related to the Company's business or assumed or
retained liabilities. Tyco Electronics was responsible for 31% of certain liabilities that arose from litigation pending or threatened at separation that was not allocated to one of the three parties,
and Tyco International and Covidien were responsible for 27% and 42%, respectively, of such liabilities. If any party defaults in payment of its allocated share of any such liability, each
non-defaulting party will be responsible for an equal portion of the amount in default together with any other non-defaulting party, although any such payments will not release
the obligation of the defaulting party. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco International manages and controls all the legal matters related to the
shared contingent liabilities, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. All costs and expenses that Tyco International incurs in connection with the defense of such
litigation, other than the amount of any judgment or settlement, which is allocated in the manner described above, will be borne equally by Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company. At the
present time, all significant matters for which the Company shared responsibility with Tyco International and Covidien under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which as previously reported in
the Company's periodic filings generally related to securities class action cases and other securities cases, have been settled. Other than matters described below under "Compliance Matters," the
Company presently is not aware of any additional legal matters which may
arise for which it would bear a portion of the responsibility under the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

As
previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, prior to the separation, Tyco International and certain of its former directors and officers were named as defendants in over 40
purported securities class action lawsuits. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities related to the securities class actions were allocated among
Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company. The Company was responsible for 31% of potential liabilities that arose upon the resolution of the litigation pending at the time of separation.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

During
fiscal 2010, Tyco International settled the remaining significant securities lawsuit, a class action captioned

Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd., et
al.

, for $79 million, with the Company being responsible for $24 million pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. The
settlement agreement provides that a portion of the settlement fund will be set aside for potential opt-out claims. The Company cannot predict presently if any opt-out claims
will be made and whether opt-out claims will exceed the amount allocated for such claims, requiring the Company to fund any portion under the sharing formula in the Separation and
Distribution Agreement. As discussed below, the Company had previously established reserves for this case. As a result of the settlement of the

Stumpf

case, the Company concluded that reserves of $22 million could be released. Accordingly, pursuant to the sharing formula, the Company recorded income of $7 million during fiscal 2010. As
of September 24, 2010, there were no remaining significant securities lawsuits outstanding.

During
fiscal 2009, the Company recorded charges of $144 million for its share of Tyco International's settlements of several securities cases and its portion of the estimated
probable loss for the then remaining securities litigation claims, including the

Stumpf

case, subject to the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

During
fiscal 2008, the Company recorded charges of $34 million for its share of Tyco International's settlements of two securities cases and income of $12 million for the
Company's portion of related recoveries of certain costs from insurers.

In
fiscal 2007, the Company was allocated a charge from Tyco International of $922 million for a class action settlement settling the majority of the securities class action
lawsuits. The portion allocated to the Company was consistent with the sharing percentage included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Tyco International placed funds in escrow for the
benefit of the class. The escrow account
earned interest that was payable to the class. In addition, interest was accrued on the class action settlement liability.

The
finalization of the class action settlement in February 2008 resulted in the extinguishment of the Company's class action settlement liability of $3,020 million, interest in
the escrow of $936 million, and class action settlement receivable of $2,084 million from the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The finalization of the settlement resulted in a decrease to
cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2008. It did not affect the cash balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because the
Company had previously fully funded its portion of the class action settlement into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability, as mentioned above.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, Tyco International received and has responded to various allegations that
certain improper payments were made by Tyco International subsidiaries, including Tyco Electronics subsidiaries, in recent years prior to the separation. Tyco International reported to the U.S.
Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission the investigative steps and remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations, including that it retained outside
counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls, and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), and that it would
continue to investigate and make periodic progress reports to these agencies. To date, the Company's baseline review has revealed that some of the Company's former business practices may not

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

have
complied with FCPA requirements. At this time, the Company believes it has adequate amounts recorded related to these matters, the amount of which is not significant. Any judgment, settlement, or
other cost incurred by Tyco International in connection with these matters not specifically allocated to Tyco International, Covidien, or the Company would be subject to the liability sharing
provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

Income Taxes

In connection with the separation, the Company entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidien's, Tyco
Electronics', and Tyco International's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including
ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free
distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the
spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code.

Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, the Company entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco
International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain
contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify the Company for 69% of certain
liabilities settled in cash by the Company with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, the Company has made similar indemnifications to Tyco
International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies
responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, the Company would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting
party or parties' obligation. The Company is responsible for all of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and
Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

Prior
to separation, certain of the Company's subsidiaries filed combined tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of the Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are
periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the
U.S. income tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax
contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes,

which relate
specifically to Tyco Electronics entities, have been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company may be required to fund portions of Covidien and Tyco International's
tax obligations. Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 13 for additional information.

In
prior years, in connection with the IRS audit of various fiscal years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax
returns

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

resulting
in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. The IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments for fiscal 1997 through 2000 for which the IRS had completed its field
work. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined that acceptance of adjustments presented for additional periods through fiscal 2006 is more likely than not to be
accepted and, accordingly, has recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
fiscal 2009, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns were completed by Tyco International and in connection with these adjustments, the Company recorded a
$97 million increase in income tax liabilities, a $10 million increase in deferred tax assets, a $60 million increase in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in
connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, and a $27 million charge to contributed surplus. See Note 13 for additional information regarding the indemnification liability to Tyco
International and Covidien.

As
the Company's tax return positions continue to be updated for periods prior to separation, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded on the Consolidated Financial
Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, the Company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material
impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Additionally, adjustments may be recorded to shareholders' equity in the future for the impact of filing final or amended income
tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien, and/or the Company's subsidiaries for the periods prior to the separation.

During
fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue Agent
Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period. Tyco International has appealed certain proposed adjustments totaling approximately
$1 billion. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers
of stock in 1998 and 1999. Based upon statutory guidelines, Tyco International estimates the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million, and it is the Company's
understanding that Tyco International is vigorously opposing the assertion of any such penalties. The penalty is asserted against a prior subsidiary of Tyco International that was distributed to Tyco
Electronics in connection with the separation. Any penalty ultimately imposed upon the Tyco Electronics subsidiary would be subject to sharing with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax
Sharing Agreement. It is the Company's understanding that Tyco International has made progress during fiscal 2010 towards resolving a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments for the years
1997 through 2000; however, several significant matters remain in dispute. The primary issues in dispute involve the tax treatment of certain intercompany transactions. If Tyco International is not
able to resolve these contested adjustments through the IRS appeals process, it may choose to litigate the disputed issues. In addition, Tyco International could settle with the IRS and pay any
related deficiencies for the undisputed tax adjustments within the next twelve months.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

The IRS continues to audit certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 and is nearing completion of its fieldwork for this period. It is possible that
the audit for the years 2001 through 2004 will conclude within the next twelve months. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Tyco International settled a matter with the IRS concerning certain tax
deductions claimed on Tyco International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004. As a result of this settlement, the Company recorded a $28 million income tax charge in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2009 to reflect the disallowance of a portion of these deductions.

The
Company has reflected $244 million of liabilities related to the audits of Tyco International's income tax returns for 1997 through 2000 and 2001 through 2004 in accrued and
other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within one year. It is anticipated that the IRS will commence its audit of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the
years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011.

The
Company continues to believe that the amounts recorded in its Consolidated Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate
resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Environmental Matters

The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of
sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and
alternative cleanup methods. As of fiscal year end 2010, the Company concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of $14 million to $24 million. As of
fiscal year end 2010, the Company concluded that the best estimate within this range is $14 million, of which $6 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and
$8 million is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters of $14 million, the
Company believes that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Matters Related to the Company's Former Wireless Systems Business

Certain liabilities and contingencies related to the Company's former Wireless Systems business were retained by the Company when this
business was sold in fiscal 2009. These include certain retained liabilities related to the State of New York contract and a contingent purchase price commitment related to the acquisition of
Com-Net by the Wireless Systems business in 2001. See additional information below. Also, see Note 5 for additional information regarding the divestiture of the Wireless Systems
business.

State of New York Contract

On September 19, 2005, the Company was awarded a twenty-year lease contract with the State of New York to construct,
operate, and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders. On August 29, 2008, the Company was served by the State with a default notice
related to the first regional network, pursuant to the contract. Under the terms of the



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

contract,
the Company had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the State. On October 16, 2008, the Company informed the State that all technical deficiencies had been
remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system ready for testing. The State conducted further testing during November and December
2008. On January 15, 2009, the State notified the Company that, in the State's opinion, the Company had not fully remediated the issues cited by the State and it had determined that the Company
was in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract. The State contends that it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the State in
conjunction with the implementation of the network, and as a result of this contention, on January 16, 2009, the State drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of
credit funded by the Company. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit, although the Company disputes that the State has any basis
to do so.

On
February 13, 2009, the Company filed a claim in the New York Court of Claims, seeking over $100 million in damages, and alleging a number of causes of action, including
breach of contract, unjust enrichment, defamation, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the imposition of a constructive trust, and seeking a declaration that the State
terminated the contract "for convenience." In September 2009, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint, with the exception of the breach of contract claims. In
November 2009, the State filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim asserting breach of contract and alleging that the State has incurred damages in excess of $275 million. The Company
moved to dismiss the counterclaim in February 2010, and in June 2010 the Court denied the motion. The Company filed its answer to the State's counterclaim in July 2010. The Company believes that the
counterclaim is without merit and intends to vigorously pursue its claims in this matter.

As
a result of these actions, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recorded pre-tax charges totaling $111 million associated with this contract. These
charges are reflected in loss from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Company's sale of the Wireless Systems business. See Note 5 for further
discussion of discontinued operations and the sale of the Wireless Systems business. The charges included an impairment charge of $61 million to write-off all costs incurred in
constructing the network as well as a charge equal to the amount drawn by the State against the standby letter of credit of $50 million. The assets related to the impairment charge were
previously reflected primarily as inventories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Com-Net

At September 24, 2010, the Company had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to its fiscal 2001
acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system
for the State of Florida is finished and the State of Florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company
does not believe it has any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested the Company's position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania, which is in the motion pleading and discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements as the Company does not believe that
any payment is probable or estimable at this time.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt, and derivative financial instruments. The fair value of
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximated book value as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009. See Note 12 for disclosure of the
fair value of debt and Note 16 for additional information on fair value measurements, including the fair value of derivative instruments.

The
Company uses derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, and commodity risks.

Foreign Exchange Risks

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company utilizes foreign currency forward and swap
contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates on intercompany transactions, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other cash transactions.

The
Company expects that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the cash flow hedge-designated instruments addressing foreign exchange
risks will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the next twelve months.

Interest Rate and Investment Risk Management

The Company issues debt, from time to time, in capital markets to fund its operations and capital needs. Such borrowings can result in
interest rate exposure. To manage the interest rate exposure and to minimize overall interest cost, the Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into
variable-rate debt (via fair value hedge designation) and/or convert a portion of variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt (via cash flow hedge designation). The
Company uses forward starting interest rate swaps and swaptions to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt (via cash flow hedge
designation). The Company also utilizes interest rate swap and swaption contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges, to manage interest rate exposures on cash and cash equivalents
and earnings volatility related to certain non-qualified deferred compensation liabilities.

During
fiscal 2010, the Company purchased swaptions and entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure prior to the probable issuance of
fixed-rate debt when the Company's 6.00% senior notes mature in fiscal 2012. The swaptions and forward starting interest rate swaps are based on a total notional amount of
$400 million and were designated as cash flow hedges of the probable interest payments. Premiums of $6 million paid to enter into the swaptions will be recognized as interest expense
over the term of the swaptions. The effective portion of swaptions and forward starting interest rate swaps is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in earnings as
interest expense over the term of the anticipated debt
issuance. There were no outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges as of September 25, 2009.

During
fiscal 2010, the Company entered into an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge on $50 million principal amount of the 6.00% senior notes. The maturity date of
the interest rate swaps coincides with the maturity date of the underlying debt. Under this contract, the Company receives fixed rates of interest applicable to the underlying debt and pays floating
rates of interest

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Financial Instruments (Continued)

based
on the one month U.S. Dollar London interbank offered rate. As of September 25, 2009, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges.

During
fiscal 2009, the Company terminated interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on $300 million principal amount of the 6.55% senior notes and $200 million
principal amount of the 6.00% senior notes. Prior to the termination, the interest rate swaps were marked to fair value, resulting in premiums of $49 million and $14 million associated
with the 6.55% senior notes and 6.00% senior notes, respectively. The premiums will be recognized as a reduction in interest expense over the life of the respective notes.

The
Company utilizes interest rate swap and swaption contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges, to manage interest rate exposure on a notional amount of
$40 million of cash and cash equivalents. Premiums received related to swaptions are recognized as interest income over the term of the swaptions. Ineffectiveness is recognized in interest
income. The effective portion of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in earnings as interest income over the
term of the instrument. Premiums received, ineffective amounts recognized in earnings, and amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income were not material during the year ended
September 24, 2010. The fair value of the contracts was not material as of September 24, 2010; no such contracts existed as of September 25, 2009.

The
Company utilizes a swap to manage exposure related to certain of the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation liabilities. The notional amount of the swap is
$19 million and acts as an economic hedge of changes in a portion of the liabilities. Both the change in value of the swap contract and the non-qualified deferred compensation
liabilities are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense. The fair value of the contract was not material as of September 24, 2010; no such contracts existed as of
September 25, 2009.

Commodity Hedges

As part of managing the exposure to certain commodity price fluctuations, the Company utilizes commodity swap contracts, all of which
are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in prices of commodities used in production.

At
September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, the Company's commodity hedges had notional values of $108 million and $29 million, respectively. The Company
expects that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the commodities hedges will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Operations
within the next twelve months.

Hedges of Net Investment

The Company hedges its net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany non-derivative financial instruments
denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $1,672 million and $1,027 million at September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009,
respectively. The Company reclassified foreign exchange losses of $25 million, $72 million, and $168 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. These amounts were
recorded as currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, offsetting foreign exchange

During fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Company incurred gains of $18 million and losses of $178 million a result of marking foreign
currency derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to fair value. Fiscal 2010 gains are largely offset by losses realized as a result of re-measuring the underlying assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to primarily the Euro or U.S. Dollar. Fiscal 2009 losses are primarily related to changes in certain Eastern European currencies during the first quarter
of fiscal 2009 and are largely offset by the gains realized as a result of re-measuring the underlying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to primarily the Euro or
U.S. Dollar.

16. Fair Value Measurements

Guidance on fair value measurement in ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

, specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the
observability of the inputs utilized in valuation of certain assets and liabilities. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs
(lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. Fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:

•

Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

•

Level 2—Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

•

Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant
to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flows methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

The Company did not have significant financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis:

•

Commodity swap contracts—Fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined using quoted prices on
futures exchanges (level 1).

•

Interest rate swaps and swaptions—Fair value of these assets is determined based on observable inputs other
than quoted prices. The positions are primarily valued using market approach models that use readily observable interest rates as their basis (level 2).

•

Investment swap contracts—Fair value of these assets is determined based on observable inputs other than
quoted prices. The positions are primarily valued using market approach models that use readily observable equity returns as their basis (level 2).



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

16. Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

•

Foreign currency contracts—Fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined using the market approach.
Values are based on observable market transactions of spot currency rates and forward rates (level 2).

•

Rabbi trust assets—Rabbi trust assets are principally comprised of equity securities that are marked to fair
value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (level 1) and fixed income securities that are marked to fair value based on quoted market prices or other pricing determinations based
on the results of market approach valuation models using observable market data such as recently reported trades, bid and offer information, and benchmark securities (level 2). During fiscal
2010, the Company concluded that fixed income securities reflect level 2 valuations and corrected amounts presented in fiscal 2009 to conform to the current year presentation.

The
majority of derivatives entered into by the Company are valued using the over-the-counter quoted market prices for similar instruments. The Company does not
believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity.

The
Company adopted fair value recognition, measurement, and disclosure provisions for non-financial assets and liabilities on September 26, 2009. Assets and
liabilities subject to this new guidance primarily include goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessments, and
non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in business combinations. Adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows.

As
of September 24, 2010, the Company did not have any non-financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value.

During
fiscal 2010, the Company used significant other observable inputs (level 2) to calculate a $12 million impairment charge related to the Dulmison connectors and
fittings product line sold during fiscal 2010 for $12 million. See Note 4 for additional information.

17. Retirement Plans

Adoption of Measurement Date Provisions and Funded Status Recognition Provisions of ASC 715

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions of ASC 715,

Compensation—Retirement Benefits

, which require that plan assets and benefits obligations be measured as of fiscal year end. Prior to
adoption of this provision, the Company's measurement date was August 31. The Company elected not to re-measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the first day of fiscal
2009. As a result, the impact of adoption in fiscal 2009 was an after-tax charge of $7 million to accumulated deficit and an after-tax increase of $2 million in
accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company has a number of contributory and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of its U.S. and
non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with local customs and practice. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation
and is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Contribution amounts are actuarially
determined. The benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

The
net periodic benefit cost (credit) for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 was as follows:

In determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class
performance expectations.

The
investment strategy for the U.S. pension plans is governed by the Company's investment committee; investment strategies for non-U.S. pension plans are governed locally.
The Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent
level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. Projected returns are based primarily on pro forma asset allocation, expected long-term
returns, and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management.

During
fiscal 2008, the Company's investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. plans' master trust from 60% equity and 40% fixed income to 30%
equity



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

17. Retirement Plans (Continued)

and
70% fixed income in an effort to better align asset risk with the anticipated payment of benefit obligations. The target asset allocation transition began in fiscal 2008. Asset reallocation will
continue over a multi-year period based on the funded status of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions.

Target
weighted-average asset allocations and weighted-average asset allocations for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans at fiscal year end 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

Tyco Electronics' common shares are not a direct investment of the Company's pension funds; however, the pension funds may indirectly include Tyco

The
Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates as well as to make discretionary voluntary
contributions from time to time. The Company anticipates that, at a minimum, it will make the minimum required contributions to its pension plans in fiscal 2011 of $4 million for
U.S. plans and $64 million for non-U.S. plans.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, the most significant of which is located in the U.S., which
include 401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of
participants' compensation and was $56 million, $55 million, and $66 million for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans

The Company maintains nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their
compensation. A record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds
correspond to a number of funds in Tyco Electronics' 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Total deferred compensation liabilities were
$49 million and $43 million at fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Note 15 for additional information regarding the Company's risk management strategy related to
deferred compensation liabilities.

Rabbi Trusts

The Company has established rabbi trusts, related to certain acquired companies, through which the assets may be used to pay
non-qualified plan benefits. The trusts primarily hold bonds and equities. The rabbi trust assets are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of the Company's
insolvency. The value of the assets held by these trusts, included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $84 million and $76 million at fiscal year end 2010 and 2009,
respectively. Total liabilities related to the assets held by the rabbi trust and reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $7 million and $9 million at fiscal year end 2010 and
2009, respectively. Plan participants are general creditors of the Company with respect to these benefits.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension and 401(k) benefits, the Company also provides certain health care coverage continuation for
qualifying retirees from date of retirement to age 65.

The tax provision for fiscal 2010 reflects a charge of $307 million primarily associated with certain proposed adjustments to prior year
income tax returns and related accrued interest partially offset by an income tax benefit of $101 million recognized in connection with the completion of certain
non-U.S. audits of prior year income tax returns. The charge of $307 million and the income tax benefit of $101 million are reflected in change in accrued income tax
liabilities in fiscal 2010 in the reconciliation above. In addition, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 reflects an income tax benefit of $72 million recognized in connection with a
reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. locations.

The
tax provision for fiscal 2009 was impacted by the $3,547 million pre-tax impairment of goodwill for which a partial tax benefit of $523 million was
recorded, a $144 million pre-tax charge related to pre-separation securities litigation for which a partial tax benefit of $25 million was recorded, a
$28 million charge related to the settlement of a tax matter (see Note 14 for additional information), and a $24 million detriment related to a $68 million
pre-tax expense recognized pursuant to the Company's Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. See Notes 14 and 19 for additional information regarding the Tax
Sharing Agreement. Additionally, as discussed further below,



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

18. Income Taxes (Continued)

the
fiscal 2009 tax provision included adjustments related to prior years tax returns, including a $49 million tax benefit reflected in change in accrued income tax liabilities in the
reconciliation above.

During
fiscal 2009, in connection with the IRS examination of the Company's 2001 through 2004 U.S. federal income tax returns, certain favorable adjustments were identified and
presented to the IRS. These adjustments resulted in a net $49 million tax benefit included in the tax provision, a $42 million increase to deferred tax assets, and a $7 million
reduction of income tax liabilities. The Company concluded these items were not material to current or prior years financial statements and, accordingly, recorded them during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2009.

The
provision for fiscal 2008 includes a benefit of $170 million primarily related to the pre-tax income pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International
and Covidien of $464 million recognized in connection with the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, for
which no tax was provided. The provision was also impacted by increased accruals in fiscal 2008 of interest related to uncertain tax positions partially offset by a $42 million benefit
associated with a favorable settlement with a taxing authority for certain pre-separation tax issues. In addition, the provision for fiscal 2008 reflects the benefits of increased
profitability in operations in lower tax rate jurisdictions, a $33 million benefit related to adjustments to tax account balances, a $25 million increase in the valuation allowance
related to restructuring charges, and a $22 million tax detriment recorded in connection with the goodwill impairment charge for which a tax benefit was not fully realized.

During
fiscal 2008, the Company, in connection with the implementation of certain new control processes, completed the analysis and reconciliation of its tax accounts. As a result of
this analysis, the Company adjusted its tax account balances and recorded a $34 million reduction in income tax liabilities, a $1 million increase in deferred tax liabilities, and a
$33 million benefit in the income tax provision.

At
fiscal year end 2010, the Company had approximately $1,269 million of U.S. federal and $85 million of U.S state net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected)
which will expire in future years through 2030. In addition, at fiscal year end 2010, the Company had approximately $136 million of U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, of which
$33 million have no expiration and $103 million will expire in future years through 2030, and $28 million of U.S. state tax credits carryforwards which will expire in
future years through 2026. The Company also had $73 million of U.S. federal capital loss carryforwards (tax effected) expiring through 2015 at fiscal year end 2010.

At
fiscal year end 2010, the Company had approximately $2,165 million of net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected) in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, of
which $1,807 million have no expiration and $358 million will expire in future years through 2025. Also, at fiscal year end 2010, there were $3 million of
non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards which will expire in future years through 2024 and $4 million of non-U.S. capital loss carryforwards (tax effected), of
which $3 million have no expiration and $1 million will expire in future years through 2017.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $2,236 million and $2,487 million at fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty
of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future
taxable income to realize the tax benefits



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

18. Income Taxes (Continued)

related
to the remaining net deferred tax assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740 which require that a valuation
allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. At fiscal year end 2010, approximately $45 million of
the valuation allowance relates to share-based compensation and will be recorded to equity if certain net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are utilized.

The
calculation of the Company's tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where the Company
conducts its operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, the Company recognizes liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax
jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact
of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the
tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that
differs from the Company's current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the
adequacy of these recorded amounts. If the Company's current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If
the Company's current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized.

The
Company has provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed
in fiscal 2011. No additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax
liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent
in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 24, 2010, certain subsidiaries had
approximately $14 billion of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to permanently reinvest. A liability could arise if the Company's intention to permanently reinvest such earnings
were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently
reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries.

Uncertain Tax Position Provisions of ASC 740

Effective September 29, 2007, the beginning of fiscal 2008, the Company adopted the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC
740. In connection with the adoption, the Company recorded a net increase in contingent tax liabilities of $1,015 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $584 million, and a
corresponding decrease in the opening balance of accumulated earnings of $431 million. Furthermore, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, certain contingent tax liabilities related to
unresolved tax matters are subject to sharing between Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company. See Note 14 for additional information regarding responsibilities for unresolved
pre-separation tax matters. Tyco International and Covidien are contractually obligated for $450 million of the Company's net increase in contingent tax liabilities recorded in
connection with its adoption of the uncertain tax position

utilized in a subsequent period.

Although
it is difficult to predict the timing or results of certain pending examinations, it is the Company's understanding that Tyco International has made progress during fiscal 2010
towards resolving with the IRS certain disputed tax adjustments related to Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000. Accordingly, Tyco International and the
IRS could reach agreement on certain of these matters within the next twelve months. However, the ultimate resolution is uncertain, and it is not possible to estimate the impact of an agreement with
respect to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 24, 2010.

The
Company is not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

partially
offset by a decrease related to the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year income tax returns. See Note 14 for further information regarding the Tax Sharing
Agreement.

In
fiscal 2009, the Company recorded net other expense of $48 million, consisting of $68 million of expense pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International
and Covidien, a $22 million gain on the retirement of debt, and $2 million of unrealized losses on rabbi trust assets. The $68 million of expense is attributable to a net
reduction of an indemnification asset primarily as a result of the settlement of various matters with the IRS. See Note 12 for additional information regarding the gain on retirement of debt.

In
fiscal 2008, the Company recorded other income of $486 million, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien, of which $464 million ($0.96
for basic earnings per share and $0.95 for diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2008) related to certain incremental tax liabilities recorded by the Company in connection with the adoption of the
uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

. See Note 18 for additional information regarding the adoption of the uncertain tax
position provisions of ASC 740.

20. Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to Tyco Electronics Ltd. by the basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to Tyco Electronics Ltd. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for
potentially dilutive unexercised share options and non-vested restricted share awards. The following table sets forth the denominators of the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share
computations:

Weighted-average shares outstanding:

Certain
share options were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the instruments' underlying exercise prices were greater than the average market
prices of Tyco Electronics' common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive. Such shares not included in the computation were 16 million, 20 million, and 21 million as of
September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009, and September 26, 2008, respectively.

As
a result of the Company's loss during fiscal 2009, non-vested restricted share awards and unexercised options to purchase Tyco Electronics' common shares with underlying
exercise prices less than the average market prices were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as inclusion of these share awards and options would have been antidilutive. Share
awards and options not included in the computation were 1 million for fiscal 2009.

the Change of Domicile and in accordance with the laws of Switzerland, the par value of the Company's common shares increased from $0.20 per share to 2.60 Swiss Francs ("CHF") per share (or $2.40
based on an exchange rate in effect on June 22, 2009). The Change of Domicile was approved at a special meeting of shareholders held on June 22, 2009. The following steps occurred in
connection with the Change of Domicile, which did not result in a change to total Shareholders' Equity:

1)

the
par value of common shares was increased from $0.20 to CHF 2.60 through a 1-for-12 reverse share split, followed by the
issuance of 11 fully paid bonus shares so that the same number of shares were outstanding before and after the Change of Domicile but with an increased par value per share, which reduced contributed
surplus by $1.1 billion with a corresponding increase to common shares;

2)

the
cancellation of approximately 32 million shares held in treasury;

3)

the
elimination of share premium with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus, all of which was designated as freely distributable reserves for Swiss
corporate and tax law purposes; and

4)

the
elimination of 125 million authorized preferred shares, none of which were issued and outstanding.

Common Shares

As a result of the adoption of the Company's articles of association in connection with the Change of Domicile but prior to the
distributions to shareholders discussed under "Distributions to Shareholders" below, the Company's ordinary share capital was $1,124 million with 468 million registered common shares and
a par value of CHF 2.60 (or $2.40 based on an exchange rate in effect on June 22, 2009). Subject to certain conditions specified in the articles of association, the shareholders have
authorized the Company's board of directors to increase the Company's share capital (the value, in CHF, of authorized shares multiplied by the par value), by issuing up to 234 million
conditional shares and up to 234 million authorized shares (until June 22, 2011). Although the Company states its par value in Swiss Francs, it continues to use the U.S. Dollar as its
reporting currency for preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Common Shares Held in Treasury

At September 24, 2010, approximately 4 million common shares were held directly in treasury and 21 million common
shares held in treasury were owned by a subsidiary of the Company. At September 25, 2009, all common shares held in treasury were owned by a subsidiary of the Company. Shares held both directly
and by the subsidiary are presented as treasury shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Contributed Surplus

Contributed surplus, subject to certain conditions, is a distributable reserve.

21. Shareholders' Equity (Continued)

Distributions to Shareholders

Under current Swiss law, distributions to shareholders made in the form of a reduction of registered share capital are exempt from
Swiss withholding tax. Beginning on January 1, 2011, subject to the adoption of implementing regulations and amendments to Swiss tax law, distributions to shareholders made out of contributed
surplus will be exempt from Swiss withholding tax. Distributions or dividends on the Company's shares must be approved by the Company's shareholders.

On
June 22, 2009, the Company's shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of the Company's common shares of
CHF 0.17 per share. During the quarter ended September 25, 2009, the distribution was paid in U.S. Dollars at a rate of $0.16 per share. This capital reduction reduced the par value of
the Company's common shares from CHF 2.60 (equivalent to $2.40) to CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24).

In
October 2009, the Company's shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of the Company's common shares of
CHF 0.34 (equivalent to $0.32) per share, payable in two equal installments in each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. The Company paid the first and second installments of the
distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters ended December 25, 2009 and March 26, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of the Company's common
shares from CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24) to CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92).

In
March 2010, the Company's shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of the Company's common shares of
CHF 0.72 (equivalent to $0.64) per share, payable in four equal installments in each quarter beginning in the third quarter of
fiscal 2010 through the second quarter of fiscal 2011. The Company paid the first and second installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters ended
June 25, 2010 and September 24, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of the Company's common shares from CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92) to CHF 1.73
(equivalent to $1.60).

Upon
approval by the shareholders of a cash distribution in the form of a capital reduction, the Company records a liability with a corresponding charge to common shares. The unpaid
portion of the distribution, CHF 0.36 (equivalent to $0.32) per share, was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 24, 2010.
There were no unpaid dividends and distributions to shareholders as of September 25, 2009.

Share Repurchase Program

During fiscal 2010, the Company purchased approximately 18 million of its common shares for $488 million. In fiscal 2009,
the Company purchased approximately 6 million of its common shares for $125 million and also settled purchases of $27 million of its common shares which occurred prior to the end
of fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, the Company purchased approximately 37 million of its common shares for $1,269 million, of which $1,242 million was paid as of September 26,
2008. Since inception of the share repurchase program, which had an authorization of $2.0 billion at September 24, 2010, the Company has purchased approximately 61 million shares
for $1,882 million. See additional information regarding the share repurchase program in Note 26.

23. Share Plans

All equity awards (restricted share awards and share options) granted by the Company subsequent to separation were granted under the Tyco Electronics Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive
Plan, as amended and restated (the "2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan is administered by the management development and compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company, which
consists exclusively of independent directors of the Company and provides for the award of share options, stock appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long-term performance
awards, restricted units, deferred stock units, restricted shares, promissory shares, and other share-based awards (collectively, "Awards"). On March 10, 2010, the Company's shareholders
approved a proposal to increase the number of shares issuable under the 2007 Plan by 15 million shares. As of September 24, 2010, the 2007 Plan provides for a maximum of
40 million common shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan allows for the use of authorized but unissued
shares or treasury shares to be used to satisfy such awards. As of September 24, 2010, the Company had 17 million shares available under the 2007 Plan.

Prior
to the separation on June 29, 2007, all equity awards held by Company employees were granted by Tyco International under Tyco International equity incentive plans. Based on
the grant date, type of award, and employing company, awards converted from Tyco International to Tyco Electronics awards in different manners. As a result of the conversion, all Tyco Electronics
restricted share awards granted to employees of Tyco International and Covidien are fully vested. Approximately 3 million vested options to purchase common shares of the Company are held by
current or former employees of Tyco International and Covidien. All share option award conversions were done in accordance with Sections 409A and 424 of the Code.

23. Share Plans (Continued)

Restricted Share Awards

Restricted share awards are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under
the 2007 Plan. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies retirement or normal retirement requirements, all or a portion of the
award may lapse, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, whereas recipients of
restricted units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents. For grants that vest based on certain specified performance criteria, the fair market value of the shares or units is expensed
over the period of performance, once achievement of criteria is deemed probable. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized
to expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date. Restricted share awards generally
vest in increments over a period of four years as determined by the management development and compensation committee, or upon attainment of various levels of performance that equal or exceed targeted
levels, if applicable. The compensation expense recognized for restricted share awards is net of estimated forfeitures.

share award activity for grants as of fiscal year end 2010 and changes during the year then ended is presented below:

As
of fiscal year end 2010, there was $68 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted share awards. The cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years.

Share Options

Share options are granted to purchase the Company's common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of the
common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2007 Plan. Options generally vest and become exercisable in equal annual
installments over a period of four years and will generally expire 10 years after the date of grant.

As
of fiscal year end 2010, there was $34 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share options granted under the Company's share option
plans. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.

Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation cost during fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 totaled $64 million, $53 million, $62 million,
respectively. All share-based compensation costs in continuing operations are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Share-based compensation expense of $2 million and
$6 million has been included on the Consolidated Statements of Operations within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax for fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company has
recognized a related tax benefit associated with its share-based compensation arrangements of $19 million, $13 million, and $17 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008,
respectively.

The
grant-date fair value of each share option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Use of a valuation model requires management to make
certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the stock of a composite of the Company's peers and
implied
volatility derived from exchange traded options on that same composite of peers. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and
post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the
expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share was based on the Company's expected dividend rate. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated
forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

fiscal 2009 was insignificant. The total cash received by the Company related to the exercise of options totaled $12 million, $1 million, and $54 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and
2008, respectively. The related excess cash tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows was not significant.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

The Company also maintains employee stock purchase plans for the benefit of employees of certain qualified U.S. and
non-U.S. subsidiaries. The terms of these plans provide employees the right to purchase shares of the Company's stock at a stated price and receive certain tax benefits. The significant
plans are discussed below.

Substantially
all full-time employees of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries are eligible to participate in
the Tyco Electronics Ltd. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESP Plan"). Eligible employees authorize payroll deductions to be made for the purchase of shares. The Company matches a portion of
the employee contribution by contributing an additional 15% of the employee's payroll deduction on the first $40,000 of payroll deductions. All common shares purchased under the ESP Plan are purchased
from a subsidiary of the Company. Participation in the ESP Plan began in December 2007. The Company incurred $1 million in matching contribution expense in each of fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008.

Substantially
all full-time employees of the Company's United Kingdom subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the Tyco Electronics Ltd. Savings Related Share Plan
(the "UK SAYE Plan"). Under the UK SAYE Plan, eligible employees are granted options to purchase shares at 85% of the market price at the time of grant. Options under the UK SAYE Plan are generally
exercisable after a period of three years and expire six months after the date of vesting. Participation in the UK SAYE Plan began in February 2008. As of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, 231,903 and
206,614 non-vested options are outstanding under the UK SAYE Plan, respectively. There are no vested options outstanding. Non-cash compensation expense related to the UK SAYE
Plan, which is included in the total share-based compensation cost referred to above, was not significant in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008.

24. Segment and Geographic Data

The Company operates through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Specialty Products, and Subsea Communications. See Note 1 for a description of the
segments in which the Company operates. The Company aggregates its operating segments into reportable segments based upon similar economic characteristics and the Company's internal business
structure.

During
the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the former Undersea Telecommunications segment was renamed Subsea Communications. This segment continues to design, manufacture, install, and
maintain undersea communications solutions.

Segment
performance is evaluated based on net sales and operating income. Generally, the Company considers all expenses to be of an operating nature, and, accordingly, allocates them to
each reportable segment. Costs specific to a segment are charged to the segment. Corporate expenses, such as headquarters administrative costs, are allocated to the segments based on segment operating
income. Pre-separation litigation charges (income) were not allocated to the segments. Intersegment sales are not material and are recorded at selling prices that approximate market
prices. Corporate assets are allocated to the segments based on segment assets.

Net
sales and operating income (loss) by segment are presented in the following table for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008:

position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, in fiscal 2008 and data utilized in the determination of the Company's income tax provision in fiscal 2005
through fiscal 2009. The Company corrected these errors in the affected prior periods included in the unaudited quarterly financial data. The correction of the tax errors reduced income (loss) from
continuing operations attributable to Tyco Electronics Ltd. and net income (loss) attributable to Tyco Electronics Ltd. by $2 million, $2 million, $3 million, and
$2 million, in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, respectively. See to Note 2 for further information regarding the correction of immaterial errors.

On September 29, 2010, the Company's board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program from $2.0 billion to $2.75 billion.
