PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("we," "Tyco Electronics," or the "Company") is a leading global provider of engineered electronic components, network solutions,
wireless systems, and undersea telecommunication systems. We design, manufacture, and market products for customers in industries from automotive, appliance, and aerospace and defense to
telecommunications, computers, and consumer electronics. Our products are produced in approximately 120 manufacturing sites in over 25 countries. With over 8,000 engineers and worldwide manufacturing,
sales, and customer service capabilities, Tyco Electronics' commitment is our customers' advantage.

Tyco
Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). For the period following
its incorporation, Tyco Electronics Ltd. did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal assets. In connection with our separation from Tyco International, the equity
interests in the entities that hold all of the assets and liabilities of Tyco International's electronics businesses were transferred to Tyco Electronics.

Our
business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions, from fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2002, of established electronics companies and divisions, including the acquisition
of AMP Incorporated and Raychem Corporation in fiscal 1999 and the Electromechanical Components Division of Siemens and OEM Division of Thomas & Betts in fiscal 2000. These companies each have
more than 50 years of history in engineering and innovation excellence. We operated as a segment of Tyco International prior to our separation.

Effective
June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics to its common shareholders. Tyco Electronics Ltd. became an independent,
publicly traded company owning the former electronics businesses of Tyco International Ltd.

Our
reporting segments manufacture and distribute our products and solutions to a number of end markets. The table below provides a summary of our reporting segments, the fiscal 2007 net

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:

•

Global leader in passive components.

With net sales of approximately $13.5 billion in fiscal 2007, we are
significantly larger than many of our competitors. In the $40 billion fragmented connector industry, our net sales were approximately $8 billion in fiscal 2007. We have established a
global leadership position in the connector industry with leading market positions in the following markets:

•

Automotive—#1

•

Computers
and peripherals—#1

•

Industrial—#1

•

Telecom/data
communications—#2

Our
scale provides us the opportunity to accelerate our sales growth by making larger investments in existing and new technologies in our core markets and to expand our presence in emerging markets.
Our leadership position also provides the opportunity to lower our purchasing costs by developing lower cost sources of supply and to maintain a flexible manufacturing footprint worldwide that is
close to our customers' locations.

•

Strong customer relationships.

As an industry leader, we have established close working relationships with our
customers. These relationships allow us to anticipate and be responsive to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with our customers in developing new
products and technologies, we believe we are able to identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products. In addition, we operate a broad
Global Account Management program through which we maintain close working relationships with the key customers in the end markets that we serve.

•

Process and product technology leadership.

We employ over 8,000 engineers dedicated to product research,
development, and engineering. Our investment of $600 million per year in product and process engineering and development together with our capital spending of nearly $900 million in
fiscal 2007, enable us to consistently provide innovative, high-quality products with efficient manufacturing methods.

•

Diverse product mix and customer base.

We manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in
various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that this diversified customer
base reduces our exposure to a particular end market and therefore the variability of our financial performance, and provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets.
Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors.

•

Balanced geographic sales mix.

We have an established manufacturing presence in over 25 countries and our sales
are global. Our global coverage positions us near our customers' locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs. We believe our balanced
sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile. In addition, our strategy is to continue to increase the percentage of production from
low-cost countries.

•

Strong and experienced management team.

We believe we have a management team that has the experience necessary
to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology


leadership.
Our Chief Executive Officer, President, and segment leaders average more than 20 years of experience in the electronics industry. They are supported by an experienced and talented
management team that is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry.

Our Strategy

Our goal is to be the world leader in providing custom-engineered electronic components and solutions for an increasingly connected world. We believe that in
achieving this goal we will increase net sales and profitability across our segments in the markets that we serve. Our business strategy is based upon the following priorities:

•

Continue to focus our existing portfolio.

As part of our strategy, we regularly review and will consider the
divestiture of underperforming or non-strategic businesses to improve our operating results and better utilize our capital. Some of these divestitures may have a material impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements, and we currently believe these divestitures, including the Power Systems business and other product exits, could reduce our consolidated net sales by approximately
15%. We have made strategic divestitures in the past and expect that we may make additional divestitures in the future. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Divestitures and Manufacturing Simplification."

•

Leverage our market leadership position to increase our market share.

We are the global leader in many of the
markets that we serve. For example, within our Electronic Components segment, we are the leading global supplier of connectors and connector systems to the automotive, computers
and storage, and industrial markets. We believe that these and other markets are critical to our success and that we must continue to strengthen our leadership position in these markets. We plan to
capitalize on the expected growth in these markets by leveraging our significant scale in the industry, the breadth of our product portfolio, our established relationships and leading specification
positions with our customers, and our extensive worldwide distribution channels.

•

Achieve market leadership in attractive and under-penetrated industries.

We plan to accelerate growth in
end-user markets in which we do not have the number one market share but which we believe have attractive growth and profitability characteristics. These markets include: aerospace and
defense, consumer electronics, mobile phone, and medical markets with respect to our Electronic Components segment; the land mobile radio market with respect to our Wireless Systems segment; and the
energy and communication service provider market with respect to our Network Solutions segment. We believe that we can further leverage our customer service and our new product and technology
capabilities in order to achieve a leading position in these markets.

•

Extend our leadership in key emerging markets.

We seek to improve our market leadership position in emerging
geographic regions, including China, Eastern Europe, and India, which we expect will experience higher growth rates compared to that of more developed regions in the world. In fiscal 2007, we
generated $1.6 billion of net sales from China, $937 million of net sales in Eastern Europe, and $168 million of net sales in India. We have been increasing our sales and
marketing, engineering, and manufacturing resources in these emerging regions in order to more fully capitalize on our skills and technologies. We believe that expansion in these regions will enable
us to grow faster than the overall global market.

•

Supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions.

We will evaluate and selectively pursue strategic
acquisitions that strengthen our market position, enhance our existing product offering, enable us to enter attractive markets, expand our technological capabilities, and provide synergy
opportunities.


•

Improve operating margins.

We intend to continue to increase our productivity and reduce our manufacturing
costs. We plan to achieve this through best in class in manufacturing, enhancing our purchasing strategy by strengthening our procurement organization and simplifying our vendor base, and further
implementing strategic programs such as our Six Sigma initiative. We also plan to continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, both by migrating facilities from high cost to low cost
countries and by consolidating within countries. With respect to our manufacturing rationalization plan, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $130 million in fiscal 2008
and up to $250 million from fiscal 2009 through 2010. These initiatives are designed to help us to maintain our competitiveness in the industry.

•

Accelerate new product development through research and development excellence.

We seek to continue to increase
the percentage of our annual net sales from products launched within the previous year. In fiscal 2007, we derived 15% of our net sales from new products launched within the previous fiscal year. In
order to accomplish this goal, we intend to focus our research, development, and engineering investment on next generation technologies and highly engineered products and platforms, and leverage
innovation across our segments.

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological
innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an
effort to develop an effective
intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.

We
own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and
trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is
obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.


While
we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that our operations
are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

Employees

As of September 28, 2007, we employed approximately 94,000 people worldwide, of whom 29,000 were in the Americas region, 27,000 were in the Europe/Middle
East/Africa region, and 38,000 were in the Asia-Pacific region. Of our total employees, approximately 58,000 were employed in manufacturing and 22,000 were represented by collective
bargaining agreements. Approximately 55% of our employees were based in low cost countries, primarily China. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

Government Regulation and Supervision

The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the United States and other countries. A small portion of our products, including defense-related
products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to
apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials
and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.

Environmental

We are committed to complying with all applicable environmental, health, and safety laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a
global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards, staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues, periodic compliance auditing, training,
and other measures. We have a program for compliance with the European Union ("EU") RoHS and WEEE Directives, the China RoHS law, and similar laws.

We
have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon
our experience, current information and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $12 million to $23 million. As of
September 28, 2007, we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately $16 million.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks described below are not the only
ones facing us. Our business is also subject to risks that affect many other companies, such as competition, technological obsolescence, labor relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical
events, and international operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations, financial condition, and
liquidity.

Risks Relating to Our Business

We face the following risks in connection with the general conditions and trends of our industry and the end markets we serve.

We encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry.

We
operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components. The competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large, diversified
manufacturers to small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has continued to become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years, and our major competitors
have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price, and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for
certain products. We cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.

We are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for continued revenue growth.

The
markets in which we operate are subject to rapid technological change. Our long-term operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop,
introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements. There are numerous
risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and
applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands.

Like other suppliers to the electronics industry, we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices.

Over
the past several years we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, pressure each year to lower our prices. In recent years, we have experienced price erosion
averaging from 2% to 4%. In order to maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot assure you that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

The life cycles of our products can be very short.

The
life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to the development cycles. As a result, the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in
material revenue, and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and
equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would be materially and adversely
affected.


Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash
flows.

In
addition to our announced divestiture of Power Systems, we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines. Any divestitures may
result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management's
attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, and the potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other
significant risks encountered.

We may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate their supply base.

Many
of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become increasingly concentrated in recent years, including the
automotive,
telecommunications, computer, and aerospace and defense industries. As our customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, and they have been able to negotiate more favorable
pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase. Our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends may adversely affect the profit
margins on our products, particularly for commodity components.

We are dependent on the automotive industry.

Approximately
30% of our net sales for fiscal 2007 were to customers in the automotive industry. The automotive market is dominated by several large manufacturers that can exert
significant price pressure on their suppliers.

In
addition, as a supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability could be negatively affected by changes in the operations, products,
business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automobile manufacturers. Demand for our automotive products also is linked to consumer demand for
automobiles, which may be adversely affected by negative trends in consumer demand.

We are dependent on the telecommunications, computer, and consumer electronics industries.

Approximately
19% of our net sales for fiscal 2007 came from sales to the telecommunications industry. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change. These markets
are dominated by several large manufacturers who can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in the
telecommunications industry, and our failure to do so would materially impair our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Approximately
10% of our net sales for fiscal 2007 came from sales to the computer and consumer electronics industries. Demand for our computer and consumer electronics products depends
primarily on underlying business and consumer demand for new computer and consumer electronics products. The amount of this demand and therefore our sales and profitability will be affected by a
variety of factors, including the rate of technological change, degree of consumer acceptance of new products, and general economic conditions. We cannot assure you that existing levels of business
and consumer demand for new computer and consumer electronics products will not decrease.


Cyclical industry and economic conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

We
are heavily dependent on the end-market industry dynamics for our products, and our operating results can be adversely affected by the cyclical demand patterns of these
markets. For example, the telecommunications industry, which accounted for approximately 19% of our net sales in fiscal 2007, has historically experienced periods of robust capital expenditure
followed by periods of retrenchment and consolidation. The aerospace and defense industry, which accounted for 5% of our net sales in fiscal 2007, has similarly undergone significant fluctuations in
demand, depending on worldwide economic and political conditions. These periodic downturns in our customers' industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.

We
are a large buyer of resin, copper, gold, brass, steel, chemicals and additives, and zinc. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of regions around the world or
are only available from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, the price of many of these raw materials, including copper and gold, has increased dramatically in recent years. Over the last three
years, we have only been able partially to offset these increases through higher selling prices. Our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected
if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are continued significant price increases for these raw materials. Any of these
events could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and, to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our
customers, our margins may decline, materially affecting our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results.

We
are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Approximately 67% of our net sales for fiscal 2007 were derived from
sales in non-U.S. markets, and we expect revenue from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue. Therefore, when the U.S. dollar
strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the euro, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. Changes in the relative values of
currencies occur from time to time and, in some instances, may have a significant effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We manage this risk in part by entering into
financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts, our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful.

We may use components and products manufactured by third parties.

We
may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products.
Our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial
or business condition. We also have third-party arrangements for the manufacture of certain products, parts, and components. If these third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and
components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged.


Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative
personnel.

Our
success depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees at our operations around the world. We depend on highly skilled technical personnel to design,
manufacture, and support our wide range of electronic components. Additionally, we rely upon experienced managerial, marketing, and support personnel to manage our business effectively and to
successfully promote our wide range of products. Any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the necessary global management, technical, and human resource skills to achieve our objectives may have
adverse affects on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

If any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws, our business may suffer.

Our
operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the United States and the European Union.
These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial, including distribution, agreements and practices with respect to the electrical components
or other markets is found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We also may be subject to third party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe
these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce any of our
commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.

We are subject to the risks of political, economic, and military instability in countries outside the United States.

Non-U.S.
markets account for a substantial portion of our business. During fiscal 2007, non-U.S. markets constituted over 67% of our net sales. We employ more
than 77% of our workforce outside the United States. Our customers are located throughout the world and we have many manufacturing, administrative, and sales facilities outside the United States.
Because of our extensive non-U.S. operations, we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including:

•

tariffs,
trade barriers, and trade disputes;

•

regulations
related to customs and import/export matters;

•

longer
payment cycles;

•

tax
issues, such as tax law changes, examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country as compared to the United States, and difficulties in
repatriating in a tax-efficient manner cash generated or held abroad;

•

challenges
in collecting accounts receivable;

•

employment
regulations and local labor conditions;

•

difficulties
protecting intellectual property;

•

instability
in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts; and

•

the
impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements.

Many
of our products that are manufactured outside of the United States are manufactured in Asia. In particular, we have sizeable operations in China, including manufacturing operations,
and in fiscal 2007 12% of our net sales were made to customers in China. The legal system in China is still


developing
and is subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders for products in China could be adversely affected by changes to or interpretation of Chinese law.

We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery
laws.

The
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to
non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that
have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our
training and compliance program, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.
Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, and violations.

We
are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and non-U.S. environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things:

•

the
generation, storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions
or discharges of substances into the environment;

•

investigation
and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites; and

•

the
health and safety of our employees.

We
may not have been, or we may not at all times be, in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, or
otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Environmental laws outside of the United States are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or
materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigative, removal, and remedial costs under certain federal and state laws are
retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or
exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerly owned
sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for
the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites.

While
we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future
environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect
our financial condition and results of operations or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present, or future
business activities.


Our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, and recycling.

The
EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of
hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their
useful life, and other related matters. These laws include the EU Restriction on Hazardous Substances, End of Life Vehicle and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the EU REACH
(chemical registration) Directive, the China law on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution by Electronic Information Products, and various other laws. These laws prohibit the use of certain
substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and
other matters. We cannot predict the extent to which these laws will proliferate in other jurisdictions or expand to address other materials or other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale.
These laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions.

We are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows.

In
the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, anti-competitive
behavior, and product liability. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and anti-trust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may
divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to
injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our
bank credit agreements contain financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and limits on
subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens. Our outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability
to consolidate, merge, and sell assets.

Although
we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control, and we
cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures. Upon the occurrence
of certain defaults under our credit facilities and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could
terminate commitments to extend further credit under our bank credit facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have
sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee
of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder.

Our
indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to repurchase
the notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering
event.


Downgrades of our debt ratings could adversely affect us.

Certain
downgrades by Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch may increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain new financing.

Future acquisitions may not be successful.

We
will continue to investigate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offering. We
cannot assure you, however, that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. Nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be
successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows
could be materially and adversely affected.

Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity.

If
we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through additional financing from banks, through public offerings or
private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures.
We cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to undertake an acquisition by issuing equity securities or
equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.

Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.

The
electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry, companies have become more aggressive in asserting
and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement or that we will not
pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the size and importance of the patent or trademark in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Risks Relating to Our Separation from Tyco International

Our historical combined financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company
and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.

Our
historical combined financial information for periods prior to our separation from Tyco International does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations, or
cash flows that we would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the following
factors:

•

Prior
to our separation, our business was operated by Tyco International as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent, publicly-traded
company. In addition, prior to our separation, Tyco International and its affiliates performed significant corporate functions for us, including tax and treasury administration and certain governance
functions, including internal audit and external reporting. Our historical Combined Financial Statements reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Tyco International for these and similar
functions.


•

Our
working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, historically were satisfied as part of the
company-wide cash management practices of Tyco International. As an independent company, we must obtain financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or
equity securities, or other arrangements.

•

Other
significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing, and business operations because we are operating as a company separate from Tyco
International.

We are responsible for a portion of Tyco International's contingent and other corporate liabilities, including those relating to shareholder
litigation.

Under
the Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements, subject to certain exceptions contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Covidien Ltd. ("Covidien"), and
Tyco International have agreed to assume and be responsible for 31%, 42%, and 27%, respectively, of certain of Tyco International's contingent and other corporate liabilities. All costs and expenses
associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities are shared equally among the parties. These contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to
consolidated securities litigation, any actions with respect to the separation plan or the distribution brought by any third party and tax liabilities for periods prior to and including the
distribution date, June 29, 2007. For more information on the contingent tax liabilities, see "We share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax
liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date." Contingent and other corporate liabilities do not include liabilities that are specifically related to one of the three
separated companies, which were allocated 100% to the relevant company.

If
any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment, when due, of any of these assumed obligations, each non-defaulting party would be required to
pay equally with any other non-defaulting party the amounts in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our
agreed-upon share of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities, including associated costs and expenses.

Many
lawsuits are outstanding against Tyco International, some of which relate to actions taken by Tyco International's former senior corporate management. On May 14, 2007, Tyco
International entered into a proposed settlement with respect to most of its outstanding securities class action litigation. We do not believe that it is feasible to predict the final outcome or
resolution of the unresolved proceedings. Although we will share any costs and expenses arising out of this litigation and any settlement thereof with Tyco International and Covidien, a failure to
consummate the proposed settlement on the agreed terms or an adverse outcome from the unresolved proceedings or liabilities or other proceedings for which we have assumed joint and several liability
under the Separation and Distribution Agreement could be material with respect to our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any given reporting period.

Tyco
International has the right to control the defense and settlement of the class action settlement and other outstanding litigation, subject to certain limitations. The timing,
nature, and amount of the class action settlement or any other settlement may not be in our best interests. Furthermore, in the event of any subsequent settlement, we may have limited notice before we
would be required to pay our portion of the settlement amount. Moreover, Tyco International stipulated, pursuant to a court order, that we, Tyco International, and Covidien each will be primarily
liable for a portion of the obligations arising from the Tyco International shareholder litigation. The stipulation also provides that if any party defaults on its obligations, the other parties are
jointly and severally liable for the defaulting party's obligations. In accordance with the stipulation, we, Covidien, and Tyco International agreed to assume and be responsible for 31%, 42%, and 27%,
respectively, of the obligations arising from the Tyco International shareholder litigation.


We share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's and Covidien's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution
date.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, we share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to
and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, we, Tyco International and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax
authorities to our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or
similar adjustments, and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax
liabilities will be shared equally among the parties. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco
International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

All
the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses, including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from Tyco International, have become our tax liabilities.
Although we have agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities.
If Tyco International and Covidien default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for
such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Tyco
International's, and Covidien's tax liabilities.

Our,
Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. We are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax
adjustments and other tax contingencies that we have assessed as probable and estimable have been reflected as a liability in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The calculation of our
tax liabilities involves dealing with the uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities
and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional income taxes will be
due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of
these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of tax liabilities.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International has the right to administer, control, and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.
The timing, nature, and amount of any settlement agreed to by Tyco International may not be in our best interests. Moreover, the other parties to the Tax Sharing Agreement will be able to remove Tyco
International as the controlling party only under limited circumstances, including a change of control or bankruptcy of Tyco International, or by a majority vote of the parties on or after the second
anniversary of the distribution. All other tax audits will be administered, controlled, and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax.


The ownership by our executive officers and some of our directors of common shares, options, or other equity awards of Tyco International or Covidien may create,
or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest.

Because
of their former positions with Tyco International, substantially all of our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, and one of
our non-employee directors, own common shares of Tyco International, options to purchase common shares of Tyco International, or other Tyco International equity awards, as well as common
shares, options to purchase common shares, and other equity awards of Covidien. The individual holdings of common shares, options to purchase common shares, or other equity awards of Tyco
International and Covidien may be significant for some of these persons compared to their total assets. These equity interests may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when these
directors and officers are faced with decisions that could benefit or affect the equity holders of Tyco International or Covidien in ways that do not benefit or affect us in the same manner.

If the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

Tyco
International received private letter rulings from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution of our common shares and Covidien common shares to
the Tyco International shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution, except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of our common shares and the Covidien common shares, will
qualify as tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). The private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in
anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. In addition to obtaining the private letter rulings, Tyco International obtained opinions from the law firm of
McDermott Will & Emery LLP confirming the tax-free status of the distribution and certain internal transactions. The private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts
and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings, from us, Covidien, and Tyco International regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters.
Notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it
determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a
result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution. If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, Tyco International would recognize gain in an amount equal
to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares and Covidien common shares distributed to Tyco International shareholders on the distribution date over Tyco International's tax basis in
such common shares, but such gain, if
recognized, generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, we would incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal
transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation should be treated as taxable transactions.

In
addition, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable and such determination was the result
of actions taken after the distribution by us, Covidien, or Tyco International, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us, Covidien, or Tyco International
as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us, Covidien, or Tyco International, then we, Covidien, and Tyco International would be
responsible for 31%, 42%, and 27%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on us, Covidien, or Tyco International as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. In the event that
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be
responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party's obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other party's taxes.


In some cases, we might have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with Tyco International and
Covidien.

The
agreements related to our separation from Tyco International and Covidien, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement, were negotiated in the
context of our separation from Tyco International while we were still part of Tyco International and, accordingly, may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm's-length negotiations among
unaffiliated third parties. The separation agreements were approved in consideration of the best interests of Tyco International's shareholders and may conflict with the interests of our
securityholders.

If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, our business prospects and the value of our securities could be adversely
affected.

Under
the rules and regulations of the SEC, we are not required to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until we file our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending September 26, 2008, so long as we continue to meet the definition of a non-accelerated filer. In our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 26, 2008, management and our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to report on the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to comply with these obligations or experience delays in reports of our management and outside auditors on our internal control over
financial reporting, we might be unable to file timely with the SEC our annual or periodic reports and
might be subject to regulatory and enforcement actions by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), including delisting from the NYSE, securities litigation, events of default under our credit
agreements, debt rating agency downgrades or rating withdrawals, and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect the value of our securities and could adversely
affect our business prospects.

Subsequent
to the filing of our Combined Financial Statements for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 in the initial filing of our registration statement on Form 10 with the SEC, we
determined that our Combined Financial Statements contained certain errors. The errors primarily resulted from the process of carving out certain income tax accounts from Tyco International's
consolidated financial statements and related information. We substantially relied upon the processes at Tyco International to prepare our carve-out accounts for income taxes. We have
determined that certain of those tax processes utilized by Tyco International in determining certain carve-out amounts for income taxes did not operate at a sufficient level of precision
relative to our materiality for us to ensure that the carve-out accounts were materially correct. Concurrently, we determined that we did not have sufficient control processes in place to
ensure that the information provided by Tyco International was complete and accurate and have concluded that the absence of these control processes was a material weakness in our internal control over
financial reporting relating to income taxes.

As
of September 28, 2007, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded the material weakness in our internal controls over financial
reporting relating to accounting for income taxes has not been fully remediated.

We
are continuing to build our tax accounting resources and capabilities to remediate this material weakness, and are implementing new control processes and procedures as part of our
efforts to become compliant with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

We might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances because of restrictions relating to U.S. federal income tax requirements
for tax-free distributions.

Our
ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted in order to preserve for U.S. federal income tax purposes the tax-free nature of the
distribution by Tyco International. Similar limitations and restrictions apply to Covidien and Tyco International. The distribution may result in corporate level taxable gain to Tyco International
under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of our common shares, Covidien's common shares, or Tyco


International's
common shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. For this purpose, any acquisitions or issuances of Tyco
International's common shares within two years before the distribution, and any acquisitions or issuances of our common shares, Covidien's common shares, or Tyco International's common shares within
two years after the distribution, generally are presumed to be part of such a plan, although we, Covidien, or Tyco International may be able to rebut that presumption. We are not aware of any such
acquisitions or issuances of Tyco International's common shares within the two years before the distribution. If an acquisition or issuance of our common shares, Covidien's common shares, or Tyco
International's common shares triggers the application of Section 355(e) of the Code, Tyco International would recognize taxable gain as described above, but such gain generally would not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, certain subsidiaries of Covidien or Tyco International or subsidiaries of ours would incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities as a result of
the application of Section 355(e) of the Code.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, there are restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of
the separation to fail to qualify as tax-favored transactions, including entering into, approving, or allowing any transaction that results in a change in ownership of more than 35% of our
common shares, a redemption of equity securities, a sale or other disposition of a substantial portion of our assets, an acquisition of a business or assets with equity securities to the extent one or
more persons would acquire 35% or more of our common shares, or engaging in certain internal transactions. These restrictions apply for the two-year period after the distribution, unless
we obtain the consent of the other parties or we obtain a private letter ruling from the IRS or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law firm that such action will not cause the
distribution or the internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation to fail to qualify as tax-favored transactions, and such letter ruling or opinion, as the case may
be, is acceptable to the parties. Covidien and Tyco International are subject to similar restrictions under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Moreover, the Tax Sharing Agreement generally provides that a
party thereto is responsible for any taxes imposed on any other party thereto as a result of the failure of the distribution or certain internal transactions to qualify as a tax-favored
transaction under the Code if such failure is attributable to certain post-distribution actions taken by or in respect of the responsible party or its shareholders, regardless of whether
the actions occur more than two years after the distribution, the other parties consent to such actions or such party obtains a favorable letter ruling or opinion of tax counsel as described above.
For example, we would be responsible for a third party's acquisition of us at a time and in a manner that would cause such failure. These restrictions may prevent us from entering into transactions
which might be advantageous to our securityholders.

Risks Relating to Our Jurisdictions of Incorporation

Legislation and negative publicity regarding Bermuda companies could increase our tax burden and adversely affect our financial condition,
results of operations, and cash flows.

Tax Legislation

We continue to assess the impact of various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals, and modifications to existing tax treaties between the United States and
foreign countries, that could result in a material increase in our U.S. federal and state taxes. The U.S. Congress has in the past considered legislation affecting the tax treatment of U.S. companies
that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions or companies' use of or relocation to offshore jurisdictions, including Bermuda. In October 2004, the U.S. Congress enacted such
legislation, which did not, however, retroactively apply to us. We continue to assess the impact of the potential for U.S. federal legislative proposals relating to deductible payments from U.S.
subsidiaries to foreign parents, as well as the impact of a recently released U.S. Treasury Department study. Concern about such deductible payments could result in tax proposals being introduced or
modified in the U.S. Congress in the future and we


cannot
assure you that these proposals would not have adverse effects on us if enacted. Such adverse effects could include substantially reducing the tax benefits of our corporate structure,
materially increasing our tax burden or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Negative Publicity

There is continuing negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, U.S. companies' use of, or relocation to, offshore jurisdictions, including Bermuda. As a
Bermuda company, this negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or governmental agencies decline to do business with us as a result of
any perceived negative public image of Bermuda companies or the possibility of our customers receiving negative media attention from doing business with a Bermuda company.

Legislation Relating to Governmental Contracts

Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect
us.

The
U.S. federal government and various states and municipalities have proposed or may propose legislation that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies that move their
corporate location abroad. We are unable to predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under
any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.

We
are unable to predict whether the final form of the proposed legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to the U.S. federal or state governments or the
willingness of our non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential impact on us of any proposed legislation in
this area and cannot assure you that the impact will not be materially adverse.

Bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

We
are organized under the laws of Bermuda. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Bermuda based on the civil liability provisions
of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our
directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that
the United States and Bermuda currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the
payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in
Bermuda.

As
a Bermuda company, we are governed by the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to United States corporations and
shareholders, including differences relating to interested director and officer transactions, shareholder lawsuits, and indemnification. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of a Bermuda
company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such
rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Under Bermuda law, a company also may agree to indemnify directors and officers for any personal liability, not involving fraud
or dishonesty, incurred in relation to the company. Thus, holders of our securities may have more


difficulty
protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

Risks Relating to Our Common Shares

The market price of our common shares may fluctuate widely.

The
market price of our common shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including:

•

our
quarterly or annual earnings;

•

changes
in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide;

•

actual
or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

changes
in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;

•

announcements
by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;

•

changes
in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;

•

the
operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; and

•

overall
market fluctuations and general economic conditions.

Investors may be unable to accurately value our common shares.

Investors
often value companies based on the stock prices and results of operations of comparable companies. Currently, no public company exists that is directly comparable to our size,
scale and product offerings. For these reasons, investors may find it difficult to accurately value our common shares, which may cause our common shares to trade below our true value.

Certain provisions of our bye-laws may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that you might
consider favorable.

Our
bye-laws contain provisions that could be considered "anti-takeover" provisions because they make it harder for a third-party to acquire us without the
consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these bye-law provisions:

•

shareholders
may not remove directors without cause, change the size of the board of directors or, except in limited circumstances, fill vacancies on the board of directors;

•

shareholders
may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent;

•

shareholders
must comply with advance notice provisions for nominating directors or presenting other proposals at shareholder meetings;

•

restrictions
will apply to any merger or other business combination (including an amalgamation under Bermuda law) between our company and any holder of 15% or more of our
issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors; and

•

our
board of directors may without shareholder approval issue preferred shares and determine their rights and terms, including voting rights, or adopt a shareholder rights
plan.

These
provisions, which may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of our issued voting shares, could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition
proposal or delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorably by our shareholders.

We
estimate that our manufacturing production by region in fiscal 2007 was approximately: Americas—35%, Europe/Middle East/Africa—35%, and
Asia-Pacific—30%.

We
expect that manufacturing production will continue to increase in the Asia-Pacific region as a percentage of total manufacturing as this region continues to experience
strong growth and our customers' manufacturing continues to migrate to the region.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Tyco Electronics Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including antitrust claims, product liability matters, environmental
matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, and other commercial disputes. In addition, we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the
ordinary course of business, we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third party's patent were to be determined against us,
we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products. If a patent
owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable, we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet and to record a
corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount.

Management
believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these
proceedings, based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, one or
more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a future period.

Tyco International Legal Proceedings

Prior to the announcement by Tyco International of the planned separation of Tyco Electronics and Covidien in January 2006, Tyco International and certain
former directors and officers were named as defendants in several lawsuits relating to securities class actions, shareholder lawsuits, and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA")
related litigation. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities related to this outstanding litigation were allocated among Tyco International,
Covidien, and us. We are responsible for 31% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the settlement of the pending litigation. If Tyco International or Covidien were to default on their
obligation to pay their allocated share of these liabilities, however, we would
be required to pay additional amounts. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco International will manage and control all the legal matters related to
assumed contingent liabilities, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. The liability sharing provisions regarding these class actions are set forth in the
Separation and Distribution Agreement among Tyco International, Tyco Electronics, and Covidien, which is described below under "—Legal Matters under Separation and Distribution Agreement."
A description of the class actions and other matters subject to this liability sharing agreement follows below.

Securities Class Actions

Tyco International and certain of its former directors and officers have been named as defendants in over 40 purported securities class action lawsuits. Tyco
International stipulated, pursuant to a court order, that each party to the Separation and Distribution Agreement will be primarily liable for a portion of the obligations arising from such
litigation. The stipulation also provides that if any party defaults on its obligations, the other parties will be jointly and severally liable for those obligations. Most of the securities class
actions have now been transferred to the United States District Court for


the
District of New Hampshire by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. On January 28, 2003, a consolidated securities class action
complaint was filed in these proceedings. On January 7, 2005, Tyco International answered the plaintiffs' consolidated complaint. On January 14, 2005, lead plaintiffs made a motion for
class certification, which Tyco International opposed on July 22, 2005. On July 5, 2005, Tyco International moved for revision of the court's October 14, 2004 order in light of a
change in law, insofar as the order denied Tyco International's motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint for failure to plead loss causation. On December 2, 2005, the court denied Tyco
International's motion. On April 4, 2006, plaintiffs filed a partial motion for summary judgment that was denied without prejudice to its later renewal. On June 12, 2006, the court
entered an order certifying a class "consisting of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Tyco International securities between December 13, 1999 and June 7, 2002,
and who were damaged thereby, excluding defendants, all of the officers, directors and partners thereof, members of their immediate families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors or
assigns, and any entity in which any of the foregoing have or had a controlling interest." On June 26, 2006, Tyco International filed a petition for leave to appeal the class certification
order to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On September 22, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied Tyco International's petition. On
July 6, 2006, the lead plaintiffs filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire a motion for a permanent injunction against prosecution of the class action styled

Brazen v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al.

that was certified by the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois. On October 26, 2006, the
court denied plaintiffs' motion for injunctive relief without prejudice.

Class Action Settlement

On May 14, 2007, Tyco International entered into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs' counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 purported
securities class action lawsuits. The actions previously had been consolidated and transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to the United States District Court for the District of
New Hampshire and include

Brazen v. Tyco International Ltd., et al., Philip Cirella v. Tyco International Ltd., et al., Hromyak v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al., Myers v. Tyco International Ltd., et al., Goldfarb v. Tyco International Ltd., et al., Rappold v. Tyco International Ltd.,
et al., Mandel v. Tyco International Ltd., et al., Schuldt v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.,

and 24 other consolidated securities cases.

The
memorandum of understanding does not resolve the following securities cases, which remain outstanding:

New Jersey v. Tyco International Ltd., et
al., Hess v. Tyco International Ltd., et al., Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd., Ballard v. Tyco International Ltd., et al., Sciallo v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al., Jasin v. Tyco International Ltd., et al., and Hall v. Kozlowski, et al

. The proposed settlement does not release claims
arising under ERISA which are not common to all class members, including any claims asserted in

Overby, et al. v. Tyco International Ltd

.

Under
the terms of the memorandum of understanding, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against Tyco International, the other settling defendants and ten other individuals in
consideration for the payment of $2,975 million from Tyco International to the certified class and assignment to the class of any net recovery of any claims possessed by Tyco International and
the other settling defendants against Tyco International's former auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers. Defendant PricewaterhouseCoopers was not a settling defendant and is not a party to the memorandum.
However, PricewaterhouseCoopers subsequently agreed to participate in the settlement as a settling defendant, and in consideration of a release of all claims against it by the parties to the
memorandum of understanding, agreed to make a payment of $225 million. Tyco International and the other settling defendants have denied and continue to deny any wrongdoing and legal liability
arising from any of the facts or conduct alleged in the actions.

Pursuant
to the terms of the memorandum of understanding, L. Dennis Kozlowski, Mark H. Swartz, and Frank E. Walsh, Jr. also are excluded from the settling defendants, and the class will
assign to Tyco International all of their claims against defendants Kozlowski, Swartz, and Walsh. In exchange,


Tyco
International will agree to pay to the certified class 50% of any net recovery against these defendants.

The
parties to the memorandum of understanding applied to the court for approval of the settlement agreement. On July 13, 2007, the United States District Court for the District
of New Hampshire
granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On November 2, 2007, the final fairness hearing for the class settlement was held. The court indicated it would approve the settlement and stated
a formal ruling would be issued shortly. If the settlement agreement does not receive final court approval, the memorandum of understanding will be null and void. By December 28, 2007, class
participants must file their proofs of claim demonstrating their right to recovery under the class settlement.

The
deadline for deciding not to participate in the class settlement was September 28, 2007. As of such date, Tyco International had received opt-out notices from
individuals and entities totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by class members. These individuals and entities may pursue their claims separately against Tyco International and any judgments
resulting from such claims would not reduce the settlement amount. One entity, Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC, filed a complaint against Tyco International on September 24, 2007 in an action
captioned

Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC v. Tyco International Ltd.

in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
alleging violations of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and
Section 18 of the Exchange Act in connection with the plaintiffs' purchases and sales of Tyco International securities between June 4, 2001 and April 30, 2002. The plaintiffs seek
unspecified compensatory damages and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. Tyco International has requested that this action be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New
Hampshire. Tyco International has advised us that it intends to vigorously defend this litigation. It is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome or to estimate the amount of loss or
range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of the

Franklin

matter or other unasserted claims from individuals that
have opted out.

Under
the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into on June 29, 2007, each of Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally
liable for the full amount of the class action settlement and any judgments resulting from opt-out claims. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies
share in the liability with Tyco International assuming 27%, Covidien 42%, and Tyco Electronics 31% of the settlement amount.

In
connection with the class action settlement, in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we were allocated a charge from Tyco International of $922 million, for which no tax benefit
was available. In addition, in fiscal 2007, we were allocated $35 million of income relating to Tyco International's expected recovery of certain costs from insurers, of which
$31 million has been collected. The portions allocated to Tyco Electronics are consistent with the sharing percentage included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement which was entered
into upon separation. Tyco International placed funds in escrow for the benefit of the class. The escrow account earns interest that is payable to the class. In addition, interest is accrued on the
class action settlement liability. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, at fiscal year end 2007, we have recognized $928 million for our portion of the escrow, a
$2,992 million liability, and a $2,064 million receivable from Tyco International and Covidien for their portion of the liability. Tyco International and Covidien also have funded their
portion of the settlement liability.

If
the proposed settlement were not consummated on the agreed terms or if the unresolved proceedings were to be determined adversely to Tyco International, our share of any additional
potential losses, which are not presently estimable, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


Securities Class Action Proceedings

After filing an initial complaint on June 26, 2002 in an action entitled

Brazen v. Tyco International Ltd., et
al

, the plaintiff filed an amended class action complaint on March 10, 2005 in the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois purporting to represent a class of purchasers
who exchanged shares of Mallinckrodt, Inc. common stock for common shares of Tyco International pursuant to the joint proxy statement and prospectus, and the registration statement in which it
was included, in connection with the October 17, 2000 merger of Tyco International and Mallinckrodt, Inc. Tyco International appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit the decision of the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire to remand

Brazen v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

to
the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois, and

Hromyak v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

,

Goldfarb v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al., Mandel v. Tyco International Ltd., et al., Myers v. Tyco International Ltd., et al., Rappold v. Tyco International Ltd., et
al.

, and

Schuldt v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

to the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County, Florida. Plaintiffs moved
to dismiss Tyco International's appeal. On December 29, 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit granted plaintiffs' motion and dismissed Tyco International's appeal. Tyco
International moved in the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County, Florida to stay and to strike the class allegations in

Goldfarb, Mandel, Myers, Rappold

,
and

Schuldt

. The Circuit Court granted Tyco International's motion to dismiss

Hromyak

, and the Florida
District Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal. These cases were included in the proposed settlement of the securities class action, which is contingent upon these cases being dismissed.

On
January 31, 2003, a civil action was filed by three plaintiffs in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,

Cirella v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al.

Plaintiffs named as defendants Tyco International, Dennis Kozlowski, Mark Swartz, and Mark Belnick. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation has transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. This case was included in the proposed settlement of the securities class action, which is
contingent upon this case being dismissed.

On
November 27, 2002, the State of New Jersey, on behalf of several state pension funds, filed a complaint,

New Jersey v. Tyco International Ltd.,
et al.

, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Tyco International, Tyco International's former auditors and certain of Tyco International's
former officers and directors. The complaint was amended on February 11, 2005. As against all defendants, the amended complaint asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, for common law fraud, aiding and abetting common law fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, and negligent misrepresentation. Claims
are asserted against the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, Section 15 of the Securities Act, Section 24(d) of the New Jersey Uniform Securities Law,
Section 421-B:25(III) of the New Hampshire Uniform Securities Law, and for breaches of fiduciary duties. Claims also are asserted against certain of the individual defendants
under Section 20A of the Exchange Act and for violation of the New Jersey RICO statute; against Tyco International under Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Section 24(c) of
the New Jersey Uniform Securities Law, Section 421-B:25(II) of the New Hampshire Uniform Securities Law, and for violation of, aiding and abetting violation of, and vicarious
liability under the New Jersey RICO statute; against Tyco International and certain of the individual defendants under Section 14(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder, and for conspiracy to violate the New Jersey RICO statute; against Tyco International, its former auditors, and certain of the individual defendants under Section 11 of
the Securities Act and for violation of, and conspiracy to violate the New Jersey RICO statute; and against Tyco International's former auditors and certain of the individual defendants for aiding and
abetting violation of the New Jersey RICO statute. Finally, claims are asserted against the individual defendants and Tyco International's former auditors for aiding and abetting the individual
defendants' breaches of fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs assert that the defendants violated the securities laws and otherwise engaged in fraudulent acts by making materially false and misleading
statements and omissions concerning, among other things, the following: unauthorized and


improper
compensation of certain of Tyco International's former executives; their improper use of Tyco International's funds for personal benefit and their improper self-dealing in real
estate. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. On June 10, 2005, Tyco International moved to dismiss in part the amended complaint. On June 11, 2007, the
court granted in part and denied in part Tyco International's motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Many of the above plaintiffs' claims remain pending. On July 24, 2007, the plaintiffs
moved for leave to amend their complaint again. Tyco International responded in opposition to the motion on August 10, 2007, and the court has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs' motion.

An
action entitled

Hess v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

, was filed on June 3, 2004 in the Superior Court of the State of
California for the County of Los Angeles against certain of Tyco International's former directors and officers, Tyco International's former auditors and Tyco International. On October 25, 2006,
the court lifted its previous order staying the case during the pendency of a related arbitration to which Tyco International was not a party. On December 26, 2006, Tyco International filed a
demurrer seeking dismissal of the action on the ground that the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to state causes of action. Before argument could be heard on the demurrer, the plaintiffs
notified the court that they would file an amended complaint. The amended complaint was filed on July 9, 2007. The amended complaint asserts claims of fraud, negligent representation, aiding
and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with, and subsequent to, an underlying settlement of litigation brought by shareholders in Progressive Angioplasty
Systems, Inc. where the plaintiffs received Tyco International's stock as consideration. The amended complaint alleges collective losses of not less than $20 million and seeks
compensatory and punitive damages. On September 13, 2007, Tyco
International filed its answer to the amended complaint. The parties also have begun to engage in discovery, serving document requests and interrogatories.

On
October 30, 2003,

Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd.

was transferred to the United States District Court for the District
of New Hampshire by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. The complaint asserts claims against Tyco International based on Section 11 of the Securities Act, Section 15 of the
Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. In orders dated September 2, 2005 and January 6, 2005, the court denied Tyco
International's motion to dismiss. On June 12, 2007, the court certified a purported class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased TyCom stock, either pursuant to a July 26,
2000 registration statement and prospectus for TyCom's initial public offering, or on the open market between July 26, 2000 and December 17, 2001. On June 26, 2007, Tyco
International filed a Rule 23(f) petition seeking leave to appeal the class certification order. On September 13, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied
Tyco International's petition.

artificially deflated stock prices. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On
March 31, 2007, Tyco International filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and the court granted the motion to dismiss on June 13, 2007.

On
January 20, 2004, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,

Ballard v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al

. Plaintiffs are trustees of various trusts that


were
allegedly major shareholders of AMP, Inc., a company acquired by Tyco International in April 1999. Plaintiffs named as defendants Tyco International, five of its former officers and
directors, and PricewaterhourseCoopers LLP. As against all defendants, the complaint asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5
promulgated thereunder, and Section 11 of the Securities Act. As against the Tyco International defendants, the complaint asserts causes of action under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act

the complaint asserts causes of action under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 15 of the Securities Act. The complaint alleges that defendants engaged in a scheme to
artificially inflate Tyco International's earnings and to mislead investors as to Tyco International's positive earnings, growth and acquisition synergies prior to and in connection with its
acquisition of AMP, Inc. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Tyco International moved to
dismiss the complaint, and that motion was denied. On August 5, 2005, defendant Michael A. Ashcroft's motion to dismiss with respect to the plaintiffs' claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
the Exchange Act, Section 15 of the Securities Act, and common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims was granted.

A
complaint,

Sciallo v. Tyco International Ltd., et al

., was filed on September 30, 2003 in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs purport to be former executives of U.S. Surgical who traded their U.S. Surgical stock options for Tyco International stock options when Tyco
International acquired U.S. Surgical on October 1, 1998. Plaintiffs named as defendants Tyco International and certain former Tyco International directors and executives. The complaint asserts
causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, for common law fraud and negligence, and violation of New York General
Business Law Section 349, which prohibits deceptive acts and practices in the conduct of any business. The complaint alleges that defendants made materially false and misleading statements and
omissions concerning, among other things, Tyco International's financial condition and accounting practices. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States
District Court for the District of New Hampshire.

A
complaint was filed on September 2, 2004 in the Court of Common Pleas for Dauphin County, Pennsylvania,

Jasin v. Tyco International Ltd., et
al.

This

pro se

plaintiff named as additional defendants Tyco International (US) Inc., Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco
International's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Swartz, Tyco International's former Chief Financial Officer and Director, and Juergen Gromer, currently President of Tyco Electronics.
Plaintiff's complaint asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, as well as Section 11 of the Securities
Act. Claims against Messrs. Kozlowski, Swartz, and Gromer also are asserted under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and
Section 20A of the Exchange Act, as well as Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act. Plaintiff also asserts common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unfair trade practice,
breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of Section 1-402 of the Pennsylvania Securities Act of 1972. Tyco International has removed
the complaint to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court
for the District of New Hampshire.

The
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation was notified that

Hall v. Kozlowski, et al.

, an action relating to plaintiff's employment,
401(k) and pension plans and ownership of Tyco International stock, may be an action that should be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Thereafter, the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On March 16, 2005, Tyco International answered
plaintiff's amended complaint.

Plaintiff
moved to remand

Davis v. Kozlowski, et al.

, an action originally filed on December 9, 2003, from the United States
District Court for the District of New Hampshire back to the Circuit Court of


Cook
County, Illinois. On March 17, 2005, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire granted plaintiff's motion to remand and denied defendants' motion to dismiss. On
March 31, 2005, Tyco International moved for reconsideration of the court's remand order. On July 17, 2006, the court entered an order granting Tyco International's motion to dismiss on
the grounds that all of plaintiff's claims were preempted by federal law. The motion to dismiss was granted without prejudice to plaintiff's right to file another action in state court asserting
claims that are not preempted by federal law. On January 8, 2007, plaintiff filed an action in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and
other relief. On January 12, 2007, Tyco International removed the re-filed action to federal court in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern
Division. On February 1, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued a conditional transfer order transferring the case to the United States District Court for the District of
New Hampshire. Plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court on February 12, 2007 and moved the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to vacate the conditional transfer order
on March 9, 2007. Tyco International filed an opposition to the motion to vacate on March 29, 2007. On March 15, 2007, Tyco International filed an opposition to plaintiffs' remand
motion and filed a cross-motion to dismiss the action. Briefing on the cross-motion was completed on April 26, 2007. On May 31, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
denied the motion to vacate the conditional transfer order. On June 15, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the case back to the United States District Court for
the District of New Hampshire. On October 16, 2007, Tyco International filed its renewed cross-motion to dismiss the action.

Shareholder Derivative Litigation

An action was filed on June 7, 2002 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,

Levin v. Kozlowski, et
al.

, alleging that the individually named defendants breached their fiduciary duties, committed waste and mismanagement, and engaged in self-dealing in connection
with certain Tyco International accounting practices, individual board members' use of Tyco International funds, and the financial disclosures of certain mergers and acquisitions. Plaintiffs further
alleged that certain of the individual defendants converted corporate assets for their own use. Plaintiffs seek money damages. Plaintiffs agreed to stay that action pending the resolution of the
federal derivative action, which was dismissed by the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire on October 14, 2004; and the appeal from that ruling was voluntarily
dismissed on May 19, 2005. On June 14, 2005, plaintiffs resumed the

Levin

action. On September 22, 2005, Tyco International filed a
motion to dismiss the derivative complaint. On November 14, 2006, the Supreme Court of the State of New York dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On December 11, 2006, plaintiffs
filed a notice of appeal of the court's November 14, 2006 order dismissing the complaint. On October 25, 2007, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First
Department, heard oral arguments in this action, and on November 15, 2007, the court denied the plaintiff's appeal.


ERISA Litigation

Tyco International and certain of its current and former employees, officers, and directors have been named as defendants in eight class actions brought under
ERISA. Two of the actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire and the six remaining actions were transferred to that court by the Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation. All eight actions have been consolidated in the District Court in New Hampshire. The consolidated complaint purports to bring claims on behalf of the Tyco International
Retirement Savings and Investment Plans and the participants therein and alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA by negligently misrepresenting and negligently failing
to disclose material information concerning, among other things, the following: related-party transactions and executive compensation; Tyco International's mergers and acquisitions and the accounting
therefor, as well as allegedly undisclosed acquisitions; and misstatements of Tyco International's financial results. The complaint also asserts that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by
allowing the Plans to invest in Tyco International's shares when it was not a prudent investment. The complaints seek recovery of alleged plan losses arising from alleged breaches of fiduciary duties.
On January 12, 2005, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire denied, without prejudice, Tyco International's motion to dismiss certain additional individual
defendants from the action. On January 20, 2005, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. On January 27, 2005, Tyco International answered the plaintiffs' consolidated
complaint. Also, on January 28, 2005, Tyco International and certain individual defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's January 12, 2005 order, insofar as it related
to the Tyco International Retirement Committee. On May 25, 2005, the court denied the motion for reconsideration. On July 11, 2005, Tyco International and certain individual defendants
opposed plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On August 15, 2006, the court entered an order certifying a class "consisting of all Participants in the Plans for whose individual accounts
the Plans purchased and/or held shares of Tyco Stock Fund at any time from August 12, 1998 to July 25, 2002." On August 29, 2006, Tyco International filed a petition for leave to
appeal the class certification order to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On November 13, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied Tyco
International's petition. On November 28, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking an order directing them to serve notice of the ERISA class action on potential class members. Tyco
International did not object to service of notice on potential class members, and on January 11, 2007, plaintiffs filed a motion, assented to by Tyco International that proposed an agreed upon
form of notice. On January 18, 2007, the court granted that motion. On December 5, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking leave to file an amended complaint. Subsequently, on
January 10, 2007, plaintiffs filed a motion to withdraw their motion to amend the complaint without prejudice.

Tyco International Litigation Against Former Senior Management

Tyco International, Ltd. v. L. Dennis Kozlowski, United States District Court, Southern District of New York,
No. 02-CV-7317, filed September 12, 2002, amended April 1, 2003

.    Tyco International filed a civil complaint against
Tyco International's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dennis Kozlowski, for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. Tyco International amended that complaint on
April 1, 2003. The amended complaint alleges that the defendant misappropriated millions of dollars from Tyco International's Key Employee Loan Program and relocation program; awarded millions
of dollars in unauthorized bonuses to himself and certain other Tyco International employees; engaged in improper self-dealing real estate transactions involving Tyco International's
assets; and conspired with certain other former Tyco International employees in committing these acts. The amended complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust
enrichment, breach of contract, conversion, constructive trust, and other wrongful conduct. The amended complaint seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by Tyco International as a result of the
former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's conduct, and of all remuneration, including restricted and unrestricted


shares
and options, obtained by Mr. Kozlowski during the course of this conduct. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for
the District of New Hampshire. On October 6, 2003, Mr. Kozlowski filed a motion to dismiss or stay the case and compel arbitration, which was denied on March 16, 2004, with one
exception relating to the arbitration of a claim asserting the fraudulent inducement of Mr. Kozlowski's retention agreement. On April 9, 2004, Mr. Kozlowski filed an answer,
affirmative defenses and counterclaims, seeking amounts allegedly due pursuant to his purported retention agreement, life insurance policies, and other arrangements. Tyco International filed its reply
to the counterclaims on April 29, 2004. Discovery in this and the other affirmative cases is proceeding.

Mr. Kozlowski
was tried on criminal charges in New York County. The first criminal trial resulted in a mistrial declared on April 2, 2004. The retrial of
Mr. Kozlowski began on January 18, 2005 and concluded on June 17, 2005, when the jury returned verdicts. Of the thirty-one counts submitted to it, which were similar
to certain of the claims alleged in Tyco International's affirmative action described above, twenty-two were against Mr. Kozlowski. The jury found Mr. Kozlowski guilty on all
charges of grand larceny, conspiracy and securities fraud, and all but one count of falsification of business records. On September 19, 2005, Mr. Kozlowski was sentenced to a term of
imprisonment of eight and one-third years to twenty-five years, and ordered to pay an individual fine of $70 million and restitution, jointly and severally with
Mr. Swartz, to Tyco International of $134 million within one year. On September 19, 2005, Mr. Kozlowski filed a notice of appeal from his conviction and on
October 3, 2006 filed a brief in support of his appeal. On January 2, 2007, by order of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, the New York County District Attorney's office
released to Tyco International, on behalf of Mr. Kozlowski, $98 million in restitution. The payment by Mr. Kozlowski was made pending the outcome of his appeal, which was denied
on November 15, 2007.

Tyco International, Ltd. v. Mark H. Swartz, United States District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 03-CV-2247
(TPG), filed April 1, 2003

.    Tyco International filed an arbitration claim against Mark Swartz, its former Chief Financial Officer and director, on
October 7, 2002. As a consequence of Mr. Swartz's refusal to submit to the jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association, Tyco International filed a civil complaint against him on
April 1, 2003, for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. The action alleges that the defendant misappropriated millions of dollars from Tyco International's Key Employee Loan
Program and relocation program; approved and implemented awards of millions of dollars of unauthorized bonuses to himself and certain other Tyco International employees; awarded millions of dollars in
unauthorized payments to himself; engaged in improper self-dealing real estate transactions involving Tyco International's assets; and conspired with certain other former Tyco
International employees in committing these acts. The complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust enrichment, conversion and constructive trust, and other wrongful
conduct. The action seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by Tyco International as a result of the former Chief Financial Officer and director's conduct, and all remuneration, including
restricted and unrestricted shares and options, obtained by Mr. Swartz during the course of this conduct. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United
States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Mr. Swartz moved to dismiss Tyco International's complaint and to compel arbitration of the parties' respective claims. The court denied
Mr. Swartz's motion and he has appealed the court's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. His appeal was heard on December 8, 2004. The First Circuit
affirmed the District Court's decision on September 7, 2005. Discovery in this and the other affirmative cases is proceeding.

Mr. Swartz
was tried on criminal charges in New York County. The first criminal trial resulted in a mistrial declared on April 2, 2004. The retrial of Mr. Swartz
began on January 18, 2005 and concluded on June 17, 2005, when the jury returned verdicts. Of the thirty-one counts submitted to it, which were similar to certain of the
claims alleged in Tyco International's affirmative action described above, twenty-three were against Mr. Swartz. The jury found Mr. Swartz guilty on all charges of grand larceny,


conspiracy
and securities fraud, and all but one count of falsification of business records. On September 19, 2005, Mr. Swartz was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eight and
one-third years to twenty-five years, and ordered to pay an individual fine of $35 million and restitution, jointly and severally with Mr. Kozlowski, to Tyco
International of $134 million within one year and Mr. Swartz was ordered individually to pay restitution to Tyco International of an additional $1 million. On September 19,
2005, Mr. Swartz filed a notice of appeal from his conviction and on October 3, 2006 filed a brief in support of his appeal. On October 27, 2006, Mr. Swartz paid
restitution to Tyco International in the amount of $38 million. The payment by Mr. Swartz was made pending the outcome of his appeal, which was denied on November 15, 2007.

Tyco International, Ltd. v. L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz, United States District Court Southern District of New York,
No. 02-CV-9705, filed December 6, 2002

.    Tyco International filed a civil complaint against its former Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer and director pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act for disgorgement of short-swing profits from prohibited transactions in Tyco
International's common shares
believed to exceed $40 million. The action seeks disgorgement of profits, interest, attorneys' fees, and costs. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the
United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On October 6, 2003, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz moved to dismiss the claims against them based upon the statute of
limitations. On March 16, 2004, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss in part with leave for Tyco International to file an amended complaint. Tyco International filed an amended
complaint on May 14, 2004. The defendants moved to dismiss certain claims in the amended complaint on June 28, 2004. The defendants' motion to dismiss was denied on April 21,
2005. The defendants' motion to extend time to answer the complaint until thirty days after the conclusion of deliberations in the criminal trial was granted on May 17, 2005. Both defendants
filed their answers on July 18, 2005. Discovery in this and the other affirmative cases is proceeding.

Tyco International Ltd. v. Frank E. Walsh, Jr., United States District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 02-CV-4633,
filed June 17, 2002

.    Tyco International filed a civil complaint against Frank E. Walsh, Jr., a former director, for breach of fiduciary duty and related
wrongful conduct involving receipt by Walsh of a $20 million payment in connection with Tyco International's 2001 acquisition of the CIT Group, Inc. The action alleges causes of action
for restitution, breach of fiduciary duty and inducing breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, and constructive trust, and seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by Tyco
International as a result of the defendant director's conduct. On December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco International, which was deposited by Tyco
International in January 2003, as a result of a plea bargain agreement with the New York County District Attorney. Tyco International's claims against Mr. Walsh are still pending. The
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Discovery in this and the other affirmative cases is
proceeding.

Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities

Tyco International and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the SEC, the U.S. Department of Labor, the General Service Administration and
others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into Tyco International's governance, management, operations, accounting, and related controls. We and
Tyco International are cooperating with these investigations and are complying with these requests.

The
Department of Labor served document subpoenas on Tyco International and Fidelity Management Trust Company for documents concerning the administration of the Tyco International
Retirement Savings and Investment Plans. The current focus of the Department of Labor's inquiry concerns the losses allegedly experienced by the plans due to investments in Tyco International's stock.


The
Department of Labor has authority to bring suit on behalf of the plans and their participants against those acting as fiduciaries to the plans for recovery of losses and additional penalties,
although it has not informed Tyco International of any intention to do so. Tyco International is continuing to cooperate with the Department of Labor's investigation.

Tyco
International has advised us that it cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can it predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible
that Tyco International will be required to pay material fines or suffer other penalties. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from
an adverse resolution of these matters. As a result, our share of such potential losses also is not estimable and may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations,
or cash flows.

Compliance Matters

Tyco International has received and responded to various allegations that certain improper payments were made by Tyco International subsidiaries, including Tyco
Electronics subsidiaries, in recent years. During 2005 and 2006, Tyco International reported to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it
had taken in response to the allegations. Tyco International also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of its policies,
controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies, and that it would present its
factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. Tyco International and Tyco Electronics have had communications with the DOJ and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review being conducted
by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper payments identified by Tyco International and us in the course of our ongoing compliance
activities. To date, the baseline review has revealed that some business practices may not comply with Tyco International and FCPA requirements. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of these
matters and other allegations reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and, therefore, cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an
adverse resolution of any or all of these matters. However, it is possible that we may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties, or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Any judgment, settlement, or other cost incurred by Tyco International in connection with these matters would be subject to the
liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which provides that any liabilities not primarily related to any of the businesses of Tyco International, Covidien, or Tyco
Electronics will be shared equally among the companies.

Legal Matters under Separation and Distribution Agreement

As a party to the Separation and Distribution Agreement among us, Tyco International, and Covidien which governs the relationships among us, Tyco International,
and Covidien and provides for the allocation among us, Tyco International, and Covidien of Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to the respective
separations from Tyco International, we have assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to our own business or assumed or retained liabilities, and
will indemnify the other parties for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters.

Each
party to a claim will agree to cooperate in defending any claims against two or more parties for events that took place prior to, on or after June 29, 2007, the date of the
separation. Tyco International initially will act as managing party and manage and assume control of all legal matters related to any assumed Tyco International contingent liability or Tyco
International contingent asset,


including
settlement of such legal matters. In the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of Tyco International, Covidien will become the managing party. In addition, in the event of a change in
control of the managing party, a change in the chief executive officer of the managing party, or a change in the majority of the board of directors of the managing party, the managing party may be
changed by the vote of two of the three parties to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Moreover, on an annual basis the parties to the Separation and Distribution Agreement will determine
whether or not to change the managing party and the vote of two of the three parties will be sufficient to effect such change. Each of us, Covidien, and Tyco International will cooperate fully with
the applicable managing party in connection with the management of such assets and liabilities. All costs and expenses related thereto shall be shared equally by these three parties. If any party
defaults in payment of its portion of any assumed Tyco International contingent liability or the cost of managing any Tyco International contingent asset, each non-defaulting party will be
responsible for an equal portion of the amount in default together with any other non-defaulting party, although any such payments will not release the obligation of the defaulting party.

Dividend Policy

On September 26, 2007, the board of directors of Tyco Electronics declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per common share, payable on
November 1, 2007, to shareholders of record as of October 2, 2007. Future dividends on our common shares, if any, will be at the discretion of Tyco Electronics' board of directors and
will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of Bermuda law, contractual restrictions, and other factors
that the board of directors may deem relevant. We may from time to time enter into financing agreements that contain financial covenants and restrictions, some of which may limit the ability of Tyco
Electronics to pay dividends.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement among Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics, we may be required from time to time to issue common
shares upon the conversion of convertible notes of Tyco International that were outstanding at the time of the separation. During the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2007, we issued 32,786
unregistered common shares upon the conversion of Tyco International convertible notes.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and
beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors
discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Separation From Tyco International Ltd.

Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics" or the "Company", which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our"), a company
organized under the laws of Bermuda, became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). On June 29, 2007, Tyco
International distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders (the "Separation").

The
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and its subsidiaries as an independent, publicly-traded entity as
of June 29, 2007 and a combined reporting entity comprising the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating the electronics businesses of Tyco International, including Tyco
Electronics Ltd., prior to June 29, 2007.

Our
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ("GAAP"). The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007 may not be indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily
reflect what our


consolidated
and combined results of operations, financial position, and cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented, including
changes in our operations and capitalization as a result of our separation from Tyco International. Certain general corporate overhead, net class action settlement costs, and other expenses as well as
debt and related net interest expense for periods prior to the Separation have been allocated to us by Tyco International. Management believes such allocations are reasonable; however, they may not be
indicative of our actual results had we been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the periods presented. See Note 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements
for further information regarding allocated expenses.

As
discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, prior to the Separation, we used the corporate services of Tyco International for a variety of functions including treasury, tax, legal,
internal audit, human resources, and risk management. We currently perform these functions. The costs of these functions may be different than prior to the Separation. We also may incur additional
costs associated with being an independent, publicly-traded company. These additional anticipated costs are not reflected in our historical Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to
June 29, 2007.

Overview

We are a leading global provider of engineered electronic components, network solutions, wireless systems, and undersea telecommunication systems. We operate
through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Wireless Systems, and Undersea Telecommunications. We design, manufacture, and market approximately 500,000 different
products for customers in industries ranging from automotive, appliance, and aerospace and defense to telecommunications, computer, and consumer electronics. We believe the end markets that we sell
into are balanced with the total end market demand for electronic components.

We
service our customers primarily through our direct sales force that serves customers in over 150 countries. The sales force is supported by over 8,000 engineers, as well as globally
deployed manufacturing sites. Through our sales force and engineering resources, we are able to collaborate with our customers anywhere in the world to provide highly engineered products and solutions
to meet their needs.

Our
strategic objective is to increase our revenue and profitability across all of our segments in the markets we serve. This strategy is dependent upon the following strategic
priorities:

•

continue
to focus our existing portfolio;

•

leverage
our market leadership position to increase our market share;

•

achieve
market leadership in attractive and under-penetrated industries;

•

extend
our leadership in key emerging markets;

•

supplement
organic growth with strategic acquisitions;

•

improve
operating margins; and

•

accelerate
new product development through research and development excellence.

Key
business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
include:

•

Market conditions.

We have experienced sales growth that was driven by the continued increased use of
electronics across the end markets that we serve. This sales growth was achieved despite industry pricing pressures. Over the periods shown, we have experienced price erosion in the range of 2% to 4%.
We expect price erosion to continue in the future. The


increase
in our net sales for each fiscal year in the periods shown reflects volume increases that more than offset the impact of pricing pressures.

•

Raw material price increases.

We purchase approximately 200 million pounds of copper and approximately
250,000 troy ounces of gold annually. During the periods shown, the prices of these key raw materials, as well as the prices of certain other raw materials, have increased substantially. The following
table illustrates the increase in average prices related to the most significant raw materials, copper and gold, during the periods presented:

$


As
a general matter, we have been able to pass only a portion of the increased cost of these raw materials through to our customers. As a result, raw materials price increases adversely affected our
gross margins.

•

Foreign exchange.

Approximately 50% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our
results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our
reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2007 by major currencies invoiced was as follows:

Discontinued Operations

The divestiture of our Power Systems business was authorized during fiscal 2007. As a result, we assessed Power Systems' assets for impairment under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144

, "Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,"

using a
probability-weighted set of expected cash flows from the eventual disposition. We recorded a $435 million after-tax, $585 million pre-tax, impairment charge in
the third quarter of fiscal 2007 in loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. Subsequent to year end, we entered into a
definitive agreement to sell the Power Systems business for $100 million in cash, subject to a final working capital
adjustment. We expect to recognize a gain of approximately $40 million on this divestiture, which is expected to close in the first or second quarter of fiscal 2008. For additional information,
see Note 26 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

During
2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest our Printed Circuit Group business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed the sale of the Printed Circuit Group
business for $227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre-tax gain on the sale.


The
Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group businesses have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Prior to reclassification as held for sale, these businesses were components of the Other segment, which has been renamed the Undersea Telecommunications segment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated
and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Divestitures and Manufacturing Simplification

As part of our strategy, we regularly review and consider the divestiture of underperforming or non-strategic businesses to improve our operating
results and better utilize our capital. Some of these divestitures may have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently believe that these divestitures, including the
divestiture of the Power Systems business as discussed above and other product exits, could reduce our consolidated net sales by approximately 15%. We have made strategic divestitures in the past,
such as our Printed Circuit Group business discussed above, and expect that we may make additional divestitures in the future.

We
plan to continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, by migrating facilities from high-cost to low-cost countries, consolidating within countries,
and transferring product lines to low-cost countries. These initiatives are designed to help us to maintain our competitiveness in the industry. In connection with our manufacturing
rationalization plan, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $130 million in fiscal 2008 and up to $250 million from fiscal 2009 through 2010.

In
November 2004, we agreed to sell the Tyco Global Network, our undersea fiber optic telecommunications network. This business had been part of our Other segment, which has been
renamed the Undersea Telecommunications segment. We closed this sale on June 30, 2005. As part of the sale, we received cash proceeds of $130 million, and the purchaser assumed certain
liabilities. The
divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of $301 million. See Note 5 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding
divestitures.

Class Action Settlement

On May 14, 2007, Tyco International entered into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs' counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 purported
securities class action lawsuits. The memorandum of understanding does not resolve all securities cases, and several remain outstanding. In addition, the proposed settlement does not release claims
arising under ERISA.

Under
the terms of the memorandum of understanding, the plaintiffs have agreed to release all claims against Tyco International, the other settling defendants, and ten other individuals
in consideration for the payment of $2,975 million from Tyco International to the certified class. The parties to the memorandum of understanding applied to the court for approval of the
settlement agreement. On July 13, 2007, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On November 2, 2007, the final fairness hearing for the class settlement was held, and
the court indicated it would approve the settlement and stated a formal ruling would be issued shortly. If the settlement agreement does not receive final court approval, the memorandum of
understanding will be null and void. By December 28, 2007, class participants must file their proofs of claim demonstrating their right to recovery under the class settlement.

Under
the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement that was entered into in connection with the Separation, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics are jointly and
severally liable for the full amount of the class action settlement. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability and related escrow account with
Tyco International assuming 27%, Covidien 42%, and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total settlement amount.


In
the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we were allocated a charge from Tyco International of $922 million for which no tax benefit was available. In addition, in fiscal 2007, we
were allocated $35 million of income relating to Tyco International's expected recovery of certain costs from insurers, of which $31 million has been collected. The net charge of
$887 million has been recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations as allocated class action settlement costs, net. The portions allocated to us are consistent with the
sharing percentage included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Tyco International placed funds in escrow for the benefit of the class. The escrow account earns interest that is payable to
the class. In addition, interest is accrued on the class action settlement liability. At fiscal year end 2007, we recorded $928 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for our
portion of the escrow. We also recorded a $2,992 million liability and a $2,064 million receivable from Tyco International and Covidien for their portion of the liability at fiscal year
end 2007.

If
the proposed settlement were not consummated on the agreed terms or if the unresolved proceedings were to be determined adversely to Tyco International, our share of any additional
potential losses, which are not presently estimable, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic net sales growth, which is included in the discussion below, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between reported net sales growth
(the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and divestitures. Organic
net sales growth is a useful measure which we use to measure the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact
of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.

We
believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it
provides investors with a view of our operations from management's perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying
results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations
of our reporting segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and
analysis of organic net sales growth in Results of Operations below utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other
companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented below may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial
measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales.
This limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables presented in Results of Operations below provide reconciliations of organic
net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP.

Net Sales.

Net sales increased $1,160 million, or 9.4%, to $13,460 million in fiscal
2007 from $12,300 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, net sales increased $867 million, or 7.6%, to $12,300 million from $11,433 million in fiscal 2005. Foreign
currency exchange rates, primarily the euro, favorably impacted net sales by $429 million, or 3.5%, in fiscal 2007, negatively impacted net sales by $172 million, or 1.5%, in fiscal
2006, and favorably impacted net sales by $278 million, or 2.6%, in fiscal 2005. On an organic basis, net sales increased 5.8% in fiscal 2007 primarily reflecting strong growth in our Undersea
Telecommunications segment and sales in international markets. In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, organic net sales growth was 9.2% and 5.1%, respectively, reflecting increases in volume partially offset
by price erosion. Price erosion adversely affected net sales by $226 million in fiscal 2007, $313 million in fiscal 2006, and $426 million in fiscal 2005. See further discussion
below under Results of Operations by Segment.

Cost of Sales and Gross Income.

In fiscal 2007, gross income increased by
$147 million over fiscal 2006; however, gross income as a percentage of net sales decreased by 120 basis points. Our margin percentage declined due to higher organic growth in lower margin
markets such as Undersea Telecommunications. We also were negatively impacted by lower plant productivity in North America as a result of sales declines in that market by our Electronic Components
segment in fiscal 2007.


Gross
income increased by $202 million in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005, but decreased as a percentage of net sales by 30 basis points. This decline as a percentage of net sales
was attributable to increases in raw material costs, primarily metals, which unfavorably affected fiscal 2006 gross income by $293 million when compared to fiscal 2005.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a
percentage of net sales were 12.4% in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Prior to Separation, selling, general, and administrative expenses included allocated overhead expenses from Tyco International,
which decreased by $25 million to $152 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to $177 million in fiscal 2006. We incurred costs of $41 million in fiscal 2007 related to
building separate company functions that did not exist in the prior fiscal year. A portion of these costs were duplicative in fiscal 2007 as we were also allocated costs related to these functions
from Tyco International until the Separation date. Selling, general, and administrative expenses also included a $24 million gain on the sale of real estate in fiscal 2007 that related to our
Wireless Systems segment.

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.4% and 12.3% in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative
expenses include the effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, "

Share Based Payment,"

which resulted in incremental stock option charges of
$40 million in fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005.

Allocated Class Action Settlement Costs, Net.

As discussed above, in connection with the class action
settlement, we were allocated a net charge from Tyco International of $887 million in fiscal 2007. See Note 16 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further
information regarding the class action settlement and allocated net costs.

Separation Costs.

In connection with the Separation, we incurred costs of $45 million in
fiscal 2007, primarily related to employee costs, including $11 million of non-cash compensation expense related to the conversion of share option awards at Separation and
$13 million related to the acceleration of restricted share award vesting as a result of Separation. See Note 23 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further
information on the conversion of Tyco International share option awards into Tyco Electronics share option awards and the acceleration of restricted share award vesting.

Restructuring and Other Charges (Credits), Net.

Net restructuring and other charges were
$99 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $13 million in fiscal 2006. Total charges, including amounts reflected in cost of sales, increased $85 million to $104 million in
fiscal 2007 from $19 million in fiscal 2006. Increases resulted from our strategic priority to simplify our manufacturing footprint.

During
fiscal 2007, we initiated restructuring actions to exit manufacturing operations and migrate product lines to low cost countries in the Electronic Components and Network Solutions
segments and to rationalize certain product lines in the Wireless Systems segment. Restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2007 primarily related to employee severance and benefits.

Net
restructuring and other credits of $10 million in fiscal 2005 primarily resulted from the sale of previously written down assets for amounts greater than originally estimated
and the completion of exit activities related to previously acquired operations for amounts less than originally established as acquisition liabilities.

See
Note 4 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding restructuring and other charges (credits), net.

Goodwill Impairment.

During fiscal 2006, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $316 million in
our Wireless Systems segment related to the Integrated Wireless Products reporting unit. This impairment was incurred when the reporting unit experienced slower growth and profitability than
management's previous experience and future expectations due to declines in certain end markets. See


Note 9
to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the fiscal 2006 goodwill impairment. There were no goodwill impairments during fiscal 2007 or
2005.

Gain on Divestiture.

In fiscal 2005, income from continuing operations benefited from the pre-tax
$301 million gain on the divestiture of the Tyco Global Network.

Income from Operations.

Income from operations was $753 million, or 5.6% of net sales, in
fiscal 2007 as compared to $1,448 million, or 11.8%, of net sales, in fiscal 2006. The decline resulted primarily from allocated net class action settlement costs of $887 million in
fiscal 2007 and a higher level of restructuring and other charges of $85 million related to our strategic initiative to simplify our manufacturing operations.

Income
from operations was $1,448 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $2,007 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease was driven by a goodwill impairment of $316 million
in fiscal 2006 as well as a gain on divestiture in fiscal 2005 of $301 million. The remaining change was driven by an increase in net sales negatively offset by increased raw material costs.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006

Electronic Components' net sales increased $725 million, or 7.7%, to $10,111 million in fiscal 2007 from $9,386 million in fiscal 2006.
Approximately $333 million, or 3.5%, of the increase was due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Organic net sales growth of 4.0% in
fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was attributable to increases in volume partially offset by price erosion.

In
fiscal 2007, Electronic Components' organic net sales growth by industry end market was strongest in the consumer electronics, industrial machinery, and aerospace and defense end
markets. Our organic growth of 11.7% in the consumer electronics market in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 resulted from continued strong consumer demand as well as our continued focus on this
market. In the industrial machinery market, our organic net sales growth of 11.5% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 resulted from strong demand globally as companies continued to invest in factory
automation. In the aerospace and defense market, our organic net sales growth of 10.5% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by strength in North America and Europe in the commercial
aerospace market. Our organic net sales growth of 5.4% in the automotive market in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was attributable to growth in the Asia-Pacific region of 13.0% and the EMEA
region of 5.4% partially offset by a decline in the North America region that was driven by reduced production by automotive manufacturers. Finally, in the computer market, our organic net sales
declined 3.9% in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to a strategic decision to exit certain low-margin products which negatively impacted net sales by $83 million.

Electronic
Components' operating income decreased $65 million, or 4.6%, to $1,339 million fiscal 2007 from $1,404 million in fiscal 2006. Benefits from higher sales
and favorable foreign currency increases were reduced by lower productivity resulting from sales declines in North America primarily in automotive, housing related, and communication equipment
markets. Also, restructuring costs in


fiscal
2007 increased $45 million as compared to fiscal 2006, and segment results included $33 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our separation from Tyco International that
did not exist in fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005

In fiscal 2006, Electronic Components' net sales increased $629 million, or 7.2%, to $9,386 million from $8,757 million in fiscal 2005. The
weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $151 million, or 1.7%. Organic net sales growth of 8.8% in fiscal 2006 resulted from increases in volume partially
offset by price erosion.

Electronic
Components' fiscal 2006 organic net sales growth by industry end market was strongest in the communication equipment, computer, industrial machinery, and consumer electronics
markets. Our organic net sales growth of 15.8% in the communication equipment market in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was driven by strong demand across the entire market including infrastructure
equipment and mobile phones. In the computer market, our organic net sales growth of 11.5% was driven by computer shipment growth that was strong throughout all of fiscal 2006. In the industrial
machinery market, our organic net sales growth of 22.0% resulted from strong demand globally as companies continued to invest in factory automation. In the consumer electronics market, our organic net
sales growth of 19.1% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was attributable to continued strong consumer demand as well as our continued increased focus on this market. Our organic net sales growth of 5.0%
in the automotive market resulted from strong growth in Asia-Pacific of 8.5% offset by flat sales in EMEA and the Americas. In the aerospace and defense market, our organic net sales
growth slowed to 3.1% in fiscal 2006 due to a slowdown in defense electronics spending in the programs in which we participate, offset by increased sales related to commercial aircraft builds.

Electronic
Components' operating income increased $6 million to $1,404 million in fiscal 2006 from $1,398 million in fiscal 2005. Benefits from increased sales
volume and cost improvement initiatives were offset by price erosion and increased raw material prices in fiscal 2006. Increased raw material costs negatively affected margins by $261 million
in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Also, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R negatively affected fiscal 2006 results by $33 million. Finally, the weakening of certain foreign
currencies negatively impacted fiscal 2006 results by $19 million as compared to fiscal 2005.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006

Network Solutions' net sales increased $157 million, or 9.0%, to $1,897 million in fiscal 2007 from $1,740 million in fiscal 2006. The
strengthening of certain foreign currencies, primarily the euro, favorably affected net sales by $96 million, or 5.5%, in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. Organic net sales growth was
$61 million, or 3.5%, in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006.

In
fiscal 2007, Network Solutions' organic net sales growth was strong in the building networks and energy end markets; however, our organic net sales declined in the communication
service provider market. In the building networks market, our organic net sales growth of 16.2% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 resulted from higher pricing on copper cabling products as well as
increases in non-residential construction spending and network upgrades in existing buildings. Our organic net sales growth of 5.7% in the energy market in fiscal 2007 as compared to
fiscal 2006 resulted from solid growth in EMEA due to continued strong demand for high voltage products used to replace/upgrade aging grids in developed countries. On an organic basis, net sales
decreased 7.4% in the communication service provider market in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, reflecting a pause in spending on fiber network deployments by certain operators compared to
strong sales in the same period last year due to hurricane-related spending in the Americas and the accelerated build-out of fiber networks by certain operators in Europe.

Network
Solutions' operating income decreased $37 million, or 13.8%, to $231 million in fiscal 2007 from $268 million in fiscal 2006. Price increases offset
increased raw material costs. The operating income
decrease resulted from a $26 million increase in restructuring cost and a lower margin sales mix due to the sales decline in the communication service provider market in fiscal 2007 as compared
to fiscal 2006. Also, in fiscal 2007, we incurred $5 million of costs related to our separation from Tyco International that did not exist in fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005

Network Solutions' net sales increased $214 million, or 14.0%, to $1,740 million in fiscal 2006 from $1,526 million in fiscal 2005. Organic
net sales growth of $238 million, or 15.6%, in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005, resulted primarily from increases in volume. Organic net sales growth was partially offset by


$24 million,
or 1.6%, of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The impact of price erosion on fiscal 2006 net sales was minimal as a result of our pricing actions to recover
material cost increases.

In
fiscal 2006, Network Solutions' organic net sales growth was strong across the energy, communication service provider, and building networks industry end markets. In the energy
market, our organic net sales growth of 10.1% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the continued increased spending on grid infrastructure improvements, as well as the
build-out of the grid infrastructure in emerging markets. Our organic growth of 22.3% in the communication service provider market in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was driven by the
continued build-out by certain operators in Europe and the United States of fiber networks and, to a lesser extent, sales that were driven by the rebuilding required in the United States
resulting from hurricane activity. In the building networks market, our organic growth of 19.9% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 resulted from increased non-residential construction
spending, increased spending to upgrade networks in existing buildings, and increased pricing to offset increased raw material costs.

Network
Solutions' operating income increased $43 million, or 19.1%, to $268 million in fiscal 2006 from $225 million in fiscal 2005. The improvement was driven by
the net sales growth of 14.0% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005. The benefits of pricing actions and cost improvement initiatives were partially offset by increased raw material costs, primarily metals,
of $28 million in fiscal 2006 and the $4 million negative impact related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006

In fiscal 2007, Wireless Systems' net sales increased $13 million, or 1.5%, to $887 million over $874 million in fiscal 2006. Organic net
sales growth of $12 million, or 1.4%, in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 resulted from increases in volume partially offset by price erosion. The impact of foreign currency exchange
rates was minimal.

Wireless
Systems' organic net sales growth in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was driven by growth in the automotive and public safety markets offset by declines in the
communication infrastructure market.

In
fiscal 2007, Wireless Systems' operating income increased $316 million, or 132.2%, to $77 million from a loss of $239 million in fiscal 2006. As discussed above,
during fiscal 2006, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $316 million in our Wireless Systems segment for the Integrated Wireless Products reporting unit which manufactures and sells our radio
frequency components. In fiscal 2007, operating income included a $24 million gain on the sale of real estate. Increased engineering and selling investment in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal
2006 negatively impacted operating income. In addition, operating income was negatively impacted by increased restructuring costs of $5 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and
$2 million of costs related to our separation from Tyco International in fiscal 2007 that did not exist in fiscal 2006.


Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005

Wireless Systems' net sales increased $3 million to $874 million in fiscal 2006 from $871 million in fiscal 2005. Organic net sales were flat
in fiscal 2006, as increases in volume were offset by price erosion. The impact of foreign currency translation was minimal. The flat organic net sales were driven by both our radio frequency
components business and our land mobile radio business. The radio frequency components sales performance was affected by sales declines in the aerospace and defense and automotive markets as a result
of programs coming to an end offset by increased sales to the communication infrastructure market. In land mobile radio, the sales level was influenced by a slowdown in United States federal programs
in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.

Wireless
Systems' operating income decreased $331 million to an operating loss of $239 million in fiscal 2006 from operating income of $92 million in fiscal 2005.
During fiscal 2006, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $316 million in our Wireless Systems segment for the Integrated Wireless Products reporting unit. Wireless Systems' fiscal 2006
operating income was also negatively impacted by $2 million related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006

Net sales in the Undersea Telecommunications segment increased $265 million, or 88.3%, to $565 million in fiscal 2007 from $300 million in
fiscal 2006. On an organic basis, net sales increased by 88.9% in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 from our execution of the construction of a transoceanic system that connects the U.S. and
China as well as a project in the oil and gas market.

Undersea
Telecommunications had operating income of $38 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $15 million in fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of increases in sales.
Restructuring costs in fiscal 2007 increased $9 million as compared to fiscal 2006, and segment results included $1 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our separation from
Tyco International that did not exist in fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005

Net sales in the Undersea Telecommunications segment increased $21 million, or 7.5%, to $300 million in fiscal 2006 from $279 million in
fiscal 2005. Organic net sales growth of 17.4% was driven by the continued increase in the number of regional system builds and upgrades of existing systems. Foreign currencies had a minimal impact on
net sales. Fiscal 2006 net sales were negatively affected by the fiscal 2005 divestiture of the Tyco Global Network, which reported fiscal 2005 net sales of approximately $29 million.

The
Undersea Telecommunications segment had operating income of $15 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $292 million in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005, operating income
benefited from the $301 million gain on the sale of the Tyco Global Network. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R negatively affected fiscal 2006 operating income by $1 million.


Non-Operating Items

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net was $178 million in fiscal 2007, as compared to $208 million in fiscal 2006 and $249 million in fiscal 2005. The
decrease of $30 million, or 14.4%, in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 was driven by lower average debt levels. Decreases in net interest expense allocated by Tyco International were partially
offset by interest incurred on our unsecured senior bridge loan and unsecured senior revolving credit facilities. The decrease of $41 million, or 16.5%, in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 was
driven by a reduction in net interest expense allocated by Tyco International reflecting lower average debt levels offset by higher borrowing rates.

A
portion of Tyco International's net interest expense was allocated to us through June 1, 2007. During fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, we were allocated net interest expense of
$130 million, $201 million, and $239 million, respectively, which includes the effects of Tyco International's interest rate swaps. Management believes the interest expense
allocation basis was reasonable. However, these amounts may not be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for
these periods.

Other Expense, Net

Other expense, net of $219 million in fiscal 2007 includes an allocation from Tyco International of $232 million for loss on retirement of debt.
Additionally, in fiscal 2007, we recorded other income of $13 million associated with Tyco International's and Covidien's share of certain contingent tax liabilities for unresolved tax matters
of legacy Tyco International.

Other
expense, net of $365 million in fiscal 2005 consisted primarily of an expense allocation from Tyco International related to our portion of Tyco International's loss on
retirement of debt.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 includes the effects of the pre-tax charges recorded in connection with the allocated class action settlement
and the allocated loss on the retirement of debt for which no tax benefits were recorded. These impacts on the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 were $312 million and $81 million,
respectively. In addition, the fiscal 2007 effective tax rate reflects tax detriments related to increased borrowings in order to fund the class action settlement escrow and our separation from Tyco
International.

Our
effective income tax rate was 3.7% and 27.0% for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 includes a net release of $268 million of deferred
tax asset valuation allowances in connection with improved profitability in certain jurisdictions, principally the U.S. Our U.S. results of operations in fiscal 2006 combined with other available
evidence, including projections of future taxable income, indicated that it is more likely than not we will realize additional deferred tax assets in the future and accordingly the related valuation
allowance was reduced. In addition to the valuation allowance release, effective tax rate was impacted by a $39 million state tax benefit recognized in fiscal
2006, primarily related to the Tyco Global Network divestiture, as well as $87 million of tax benefits associated with the receipt of a favorable non-U.S. tax ruling permitting the
deduction of historical debt retirement costs. These decreases to the fiscal 2006 effective tax rate were partially offset by a $71 million detriment related to the impact of the goodwill
impairment in the Wireless Systems segment for which a tax benefit was not fully realized. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2005 reflects the release of $129 million of deferred tax asset
valuation allowances and $105 million of benefits recognized related to the Tyco Global Network divestiture, principally in the U.S.


The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $703 million and $611 million at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of
the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the
tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 109, "

Accounting for Income Taxes

," which requires a valuation allowance to be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not"
that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We
recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities and related interest for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the
extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss
carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon eventual settlement with the tax authorities. We adjust these liabilities in light
of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current
estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts.
Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.

Except
for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or
for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially
permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if our intentions to permanently reinvest
such earnings were to change and amounts were distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to
permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries.

(Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes

Loss from discontinued operations was $410 million in fiscal 2007. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, a plan was approved to divest our Power Systems
business and, in connection with the approval, we recorded a $435 million after-tax, $585 million pre-tax, impairment charge. As discussed above, subsequent to
year end, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Power Systems business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we consummated the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business for
$227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre-tax gain on the sale.

Income
from discontinued operations was $13 million in fiscal 2006 and $122 million in fiscal 2005, reflecting the operating results of the Power Systems business as well
as the Printed Circuit Board business that was approved for sale in fiscal 2006. As discussed above, this transaction was completed subsequent to fiscal year end 2006.

See
Note 5 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding discontinued operations.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

During fiscal 2006, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. ("FIN") 47, "

Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations—an interpretation of FASB


No. 143

." Accordingly, we have recognized asset retirement obligations of $16 million and property, plant, and equipment, net of $4 million in our Combined
Financial Statements at fiscal year end 2006. In addition, we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change which resulted in an $8 million after-tax, $12 million
pre-tax, loss. See Note 2 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for more information on FIN 47.

During
fiscal 2005, we changed the measurement date for our pension and postretirement benefit plans from September 30th to August 31st, effective October 1, 2004.
We believe that the one-month change of measurement date was a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in our Consolidated
and
Combined Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, we recorded an $11 million after-tax, $13 million pre-tax,
gain cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal 2005. See Note 15 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for more information on retirement plans.

Change in Fiscal Year and Reporting Calendar Alignment

Effective October 1, 2004, we changed our fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30th to a "52-53 week" year
ending on the last Friday of September, so that each quarterly period would be 13 weeks in length. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period will be 14 weeks,
with the first such occurrence taking place in fiscal 2011. The impact of this change was not material to the Combined Financial Statements. Net income for the transition period related to this change
was $21 million after-tax, $29 million pre-tax, and was reported within equity.

Net
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2007 was $1,538 million compared to $1,665 million in fiscal 2006. Cash provided by operating activities
was negatively impacted by a $163 million advance payment to the IRS related to shared tax liabilities. The net change in assets and liabilities was a cash decrease of $50 million. The
components of this change are set forth in the


Consolidated
and Combined Statements of Cash Flows and include increases in inventory of $124 million offset by increases in accrued and other current liabilities of $105 million.
Although overall inventory levels increased in fiscal 2007, we continued to make progress in reducing days of inventory on hand. Inventory days were 72 at September 28, 2007 compared to 75 at
September 29, 2006. Increases in accrued and other current liabilities at fiscal year end 2007 resulted from our dividend payable and increased restructuring activity in fiscal 2007.

We
continue to fund capital expenditures to support new programs and to invest in machinery and our manufacturing facilities to further enhance productivity and manufacturing
capabilities. Capital spending increased $337 million in fiscal 2007 to $892 million as compared to $555 million in fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we exercised our option to buy
five cable-laying sea vessels that were previously leased to us and used by the Undersea Telecommunications segment at a cost of $280 million, which was reflected as a capital expenditure.
Capital spending in fiscal 2007 also increased to support our increased sales activities. We expect long-term capital investment levels of approximately 4% to 5% of net sales each year.

In
fiscal 2007, we received $227 million in net cash proceeds related to the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business. Also, during fiscal 2007, we funded our portion of the
class action settlement escrow for $928 million. Related net class action settlement costs of $887 were recognized in fiscal 2007.

The
amount of pension and postretirement benefit contributions reflected in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $71 million, $69 million, and $81 million, respectively.
These amounts include voluntary pension contributions of $24 million in fiscal 2005. We anticipate pension contributions to be $70 million to $80 million per year on an ongoing
basis before consideration of voluntary contributions.

The
amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2007 was $454 million, including the $163 million related to the advance payment to the IRS for legacy tax
liabilities.

Capitalization

Total debt at September 28, 2007 was $3,378 million. At fiscal year end 2006, total debt was $3,662 million of which $3,510 million
was due to Tyco International. The amount due to Tyco International represents the portion of Tyco International's consolidated debt that was proportionately allocated to us based on our historical
funding requirements. We believe the debt allocation basis was reasonable based on our historical financing needs. However, these amounts may not be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have
incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company nor do these amounts represent actual indebtedness owed to Tyco International.

During
September 2007, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $800 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due
2012, $750 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $500 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037, all of which are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by us. TEGSA offered the senior notes in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act. In addition, the initial purchasers, through their
respective selling agents, sold less than one-half of one percent of the senior notes outside the U.S. pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with the issuance of the
senior notes, we and TEGSA entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers under which we and TEGSA agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the senior notes, to file with
the SEC an exchange offer registration statement within 210 days after the date of the original issue of the notes. Net proceeds from the sales of the senior notes were used to repay a portion
of borrowings under the unsecured senior bridge loan facility.

In
April 2007, TEGSA entered into a $2,800 million unsecured senior bridge loan facility. We are the guarantor of the bridge facility which had an original maturity date of
April 23, 2008. On


August 31,
2007, we and TEGSA amended the unsecured bridge loan facility to permit, at TEGSA's option, an extension of the maturity from April 23, 2008 to April 22, 2009.
Borrowings under the bridge facility bear interest, at TEGSA's option, at a base rate or the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin dependent on TEGSA's credit ratings and the amount
drawn under the facility. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points depending on its credit ratings. The bridge facility contains provisions that may
require mandatory prepayments or reduction of unused commitments if we or TEGSA issue debt or equity. In May 2007, tranche B was added to the bridge facility, increasing the amount of the
facility by $775 million. All balances under tranche B of the facility were paid off and all commitments under tranche B were cancelled in August 2007. Borrowings under the bridge
facility were used to fund a portion of Tyco International's debt tender offers, to repay a portion of Tyco International's existing bank credit facilities, and to fund our portion of Tyco
International's class action settlement escrow. See Note 16 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding the class action settlement.

Additionally,
in April 2007, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. We are the guarantor of the revolving credit facility. The
commitments under the revolving credit facility are $1,500 million. Interest and fees under the revolving credit facility are substantially the same as under the bridge loan facility. The
revolving credit facility will be used for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes.

As
of September 28, 2007, TEGSA had $700 million outstanding under the five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility, which bore interest at the rate of
5.38%. Also, as of September 28, 2007, TEGSA had $550 million of indebtedness outstanding under the unsecured bridge loan facility, which bore interest at the rate of 5.47%.

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we conducted a tender offer to purchase for cash our subsidiary's 7.2% notes due 2008 amounting to $86 million. Approximately
$67 million, or 78%, of the notes were tendered and extinguished.

Our
debt agreements contain financial and other customary covenants. None of these covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of September 28, 2007, we
were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.

The
September 2007 senior notes referred to above are subject to an exchange and registration rights agreement under which if certain registration requirements are not met by the
required time or registration is withdrawn or is subject to an effective stop order, there may be a registration default, requiring payment by us of liquidated damages in the form of special interest
at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days of such registration default, and at a rate of 0.50% thereafter, until such registration default is cured. As of September 28, 2007, we
have determined that the likelihood of a registration default is remote and have not accrued any special interest.

In
November 2007, TEGSA commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, as part of our ongoing effort to enhance financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the
commercial paper program are backed by the five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

In
September 2007, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per common share. The dividend was paid on November 9, 2007. Future dividends
to holders of our common shares, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial
condition, statutory requirements of Bermuda law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant.


In
September 2007, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of $750 million to purchase a portion of our outstanding common shares. No common shares
were repurchased under this program in fiscal 2007.

Our
ability to fund our capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations, the overall capacity and terms of our financing arrangements as discussed
above, and access to the capital and money markets as well as other sources of funding. Given the volatility in the financial markets, we continue to monitor the markets closely and take steps to
maintain financial flexibility and an appropriate capital structure.

On
September 19, 2005, we were awarded a contract to build and operate the statewide private radio system for the State of New York. Under the contractual terms, this is a
20-year contract that requires us to build the network and lease it to the State. As we build the network over the next five years, we will need to invest approximately $500 to
$550 million. As of September 28, 2007, we have invested $28 million, primarily consisting of inventory. We expect that in fiscal 2008 we will invest approximately $50 to
$75 million which will be funded by cash generated from operations.

Total
contractual cash obligations in the table above exclude pension and postretirement benefit obligations, income taxes, and other long-term liabilities.

We
have pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension
plans and postretirement benefit plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest
rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $73 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2008 and $70 million to
$80 million per year on an ongoing basis, before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in
Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Income
taxes and other long-term liabilities are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these
items.

At September 28, 2007, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $277 million.

At
September 28, 2007, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net by the Wireless Systems
segment. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida
is finished and the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded in our


Consolidated
and Combined Financial Statements as the outcome of this contingency currently is not estimable.

Income Tax Matters

Our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have
raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. We and Tyco International are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax
contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable and which relate specifically to the Tyco Electronics business have been recorded in our Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements. In addition, we may be required to pay additional taxes for contingencies not related to the electronics businesses as a result of the tax liability sharing arrangements
with Tyco International and Covidien entered into upon Separation.

In
fiscal 2004, in connection with the IRS audit of the fiscal 1997 through 2000 years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S.
federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During fiscal 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. Also during fiscal 2006,
Tyco International developed proposed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through fiscal 2002. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, we have determined that
acceptance of these adjustments is probable and, accordingly, have recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
These adjustments resulted in a $205 million net decrease in deferred income tax assets and a $205 million decrease in income taxes in fiscal 2006. Such adjustments did not have a
material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, Tyco International completed proposed amendments to a portion of its U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2001 through 2005 fiscal periods,
which primarily reflected the roll forward of the previous amendments for the 1997 to 2002 fiscal periods. These adjustments resulted in a $9 million increase to the tax provision on our
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in fiscal 2007. Tyco International continues to complete proposed adjustments to the remainder of its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods
subsequent to fiscal 2002. When our tax return positions are updated, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot
be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations,
or cash flows.

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 though 2000 and
issued anticipated Revenue Agents' Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The Revenue Agents' Reports propose tax audit adjustments to
certain of Tyco International's previously filed tax return positions, all of which Tyco International expected and previously assessed at each balance sheet date. Accordingly, we have made no
additional provision during fiscal 2007 with respect to our share of the proposed audit adjustments in the Revenue Agents' Reports.

Tyco
International has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact to Tyco International of $458 million, and during the third
quarter of fiscal 2007, Tyco International paid $458 million. Our portion of this payment reduced income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet by $163 million. Currently, it is our
understanding that Tyco International will appeal other proposed tax audit adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion and intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax return positions.
We continue to believe that the amounts recorded in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements relating to these tax adjustments are sufficient.


However,
the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution
of these matters could result in Tyco International filing amended U.S. federal income tax returns for years subsequent to the current fiscal 1997 to 2000 audit period and could have a material impact
on our effective tax rate in future reporting periods.

Additionally,
the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of
stock in 1998 and 1999. Based on statutory guidelines, we estimate the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. Any penalty imposed would be subject to sharing
with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Currently, it is our understanding that Tyco International will vigorously oppose the assertion of any such penalties.

In
connection with the Separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidien's, Tyco Electronics', and Tyco International's respective rights,
responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution
of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or
certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code.

Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco
International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain
contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of all liabilities settled by Tyco
Electronics with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of all
liabilities settled by the companies with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs
or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation.

Upon
Separation, $930 million of Tyco International's contingent tax liabilities related to unresolved tax matters were transferred to us in accordance with the Tax Sharing
Agreement. In addition, we recorded a receivable from Tyco International and Covidien of $675 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 29, 2007 relating to indemnifications made
by Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, an analysis of the tax reserves held by the Company, Tyco International, and Covidien
indicated that we are the primary obligor for an additional $161 million of tax and related interest for which reserves had been recorded on the books of Tyco International and Covidien.
Accordingly, the amounts recorded by us upon Separation for contingent tax liabilities and the corresponding assets for indemnifications made by Tyco International and Covidien were increased to
reflect these additional amounts. The initial liability at Separation and the adjustment made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were reflected as adjustments to contributed surplus on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Our
contractual obligation under the Tax Sharing Agreement is 31% of legacy Tyco International contingent tax liabilities, or $675 million. This net obligation is comprised of
shared contingent tax liabilities of $1,223 million, adjusted for the contractual obligations among the parties to the Tax Sharing Agreement. These contractual obligations consist of a
$844 million receivable from Tyco International and Covidien related to our shared contingent tax liabilities, a $198 million liability applicable to Tyco International and Covidien
contingent tax liabilities, and a $98 million liability under FIN 45, "

Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees
of Indebtedness of Others,

" related to the estimated fair value of future indemnifications


made
under the Tax Sharing Agreement. See further discussion in Note 13 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or
pay under this agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years. See Note 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements for additional information regarding our responsibility for contingent tax liabilities.

Legal Matters

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, antitrust claims, product
liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, and other commercial disputes. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be
resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not expect
that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a
future period. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 16 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.

Prior
to the announcement of the planned separation in January 2006, Tyco International and certain former directors and officers were named as defendants in several lawsuits
relating to securities class action, shareholder lawsuits, and ERISA related litigation. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities related to this
outstanding litigation have been allocated among Tyco International, Covidien, and us. We are responsible for 31% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the settlement of the pending litigation.
If Tyco International or Covidien were to default on their obligation to pay their allocated share of these liabilities, however, we would be required to pay additional amounts. Subject to the terms
and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco International will manage and control all the legal matters related to assumed contingent liabilities, including the defense or
settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. The liability sharing provisions regarding these class actions are set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement among Tyco International,
Tyco Electronics, and Covidien.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The
terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2007 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential
exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks
involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities
and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have
no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

We
have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 16 Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion
of these liabilities.


At
September 29, 2006, we had an off-balance sheet leasing arrangement for five cable laying sea vessels. Upon expiration of this lease in October 2006, we
exercised our option to buy these vessels for $280 million and, accordingly, the residual guarantee of $54 million was settled.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco
International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain
contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of all liabilities settled by us with respect
to unresolved legacy tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of all liabilities settled by the
companies with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any
such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These arrangements have been valued upon our separation from Tyco International with the
assistance of a third-party valuation firm in accordance with FIN 45, "

Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others

," and, accordingly, liabilities amounting to $98 million were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007. See
Notes 13 and 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information.

We
record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. See Note 13 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding estimated
product warranty.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting
policies are summarized in Note 2 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The following noted accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made
by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, "

Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements,

" and SAB No. 104, "

Revenue Recognition

," as issued by the SEC and other applicable guidance.

Our
revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sales of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass. This
time is generally when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items
where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is
recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is established at the time of sale based on historical experience
and is recorded as a reduction of sales.


Contract sales for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are
based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to completion. Cost to completion is measured based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost. Revisions in cost estimates as
contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. Contract
sales for construction related projects are generated primarily within our Wireless Systems and Undersea Telecommunications segments.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based upon product demand and historical
experience. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily
intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 3 to 50 years that are amortized on a straight-line
basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess
intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other
intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever we believe a
triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic
projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors, and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis
of goodwill impairment. Since management's judgment is involved in performing goodwill
valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in SFAS No. 142, "

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

."
First, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment
test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business
combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in
a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Estimates
about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting
unit. The income approach has been supported by additional transaction and guideline analysis. These approaches incorporate many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, and income
tax rates in assessing fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.


Income Taxes

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of
certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of
revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and international
pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the
forecasts of future
taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in
the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax
assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation
allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, the adjustment of such allowance may affect goodwill rather than the income tax provision.

Changes
in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global
operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities as well as related interest for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of
whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as
such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. We adjust these
liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different
from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our
estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded
amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Substantially all of these potential tax
liabilities are recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet as payment is not expected within one year.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit

Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the
discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality,
and turnover and are evaluated periodically


and
updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments
and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of
pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by $106.3 million, while a 25 basis point increase in the
discount rate would decrease our present value of pension obligations by $101.6 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and
expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected
long-term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by $9.8 million, while a 50 basis point increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would
decrease our pension expense by $9.8 million.

Share-Based Compensation

We adopted SFAS No. 123R, "

Share-Based Payment

," on October 1, 2005 using the modified prospective
transition method. Under SFAS No. 123R, we determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes model requires certain
assumptions that involve judgment. Such assumptions are the expected stock price volatility, expected annual dividend yield, expected life of options, and risk-free interest rate. (See
Note 23 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information related to share-based compensation.) An increase in the volatility of the Company's stock will increase
the amount of compensation expense on new awards. An increase in the holding period of options will also cause an increase in compensation expense. Dividend yields and risk-free interest
rates are less difficult to estimate, but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in expense and an increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation
expense.

Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined
benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and
prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets
and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. We currently use a measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial
statements. The measurement date provisions will become effective for us in fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing the impact of the measurement date change provision on our results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows. We adopted the funded status recognition provisions at September 28, 2007. The incremental effects of adopting the standard on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
are increases of $386 million in long-term pension and postretirement benefit liabilities, $16 million in accrued and other current liabilities, and $55 million in
other assets. The impact of adoption also resulted in additional net deferred tax assets of $122 million. The impact of adoption to accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
equity, was a reduction of $225 million. There was no impact on pension or other postretirement benefit expense, cash flows, or benefits plans in fiscal 2007. On-going compliance
with the standard will not impact pension or other postretirement benefit expense, cash flows, or benefit plans. See Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further
discussion of the implementation of the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158.


In
September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108, "

Considering the Effect of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements

." SAB No. 108 provides guidance on evaluating the materiality of prior periods' misstatements, quantifying the effects of correcting misstatements
in the current period and criteria for restatement of prior periods. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted this guidance effective for
fiscal 2007. This adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, "

Business Combinations

." SFAS No. 141R replaces
SFAS No. 141 and addresses the recognition and accounting for identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in business combinations. SFAS No. 141R is
effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 141R will have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

." SFAS
No. 160 addresses the accounting and reporting framework for minority interests by a parent company. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are
currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 160 will have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
June 2007, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF Issue No. 06-11, "

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
Share-Based Payment Awards

." EITF 06-11 requires that a realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalent units paid on unvested restricted
shares and restricted share units be reflected as an increase in contributed surplus and reflected as an addition to our excess tax benefit pool, as defined under SFAS No. 123R.
EITF 06-11 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing the impact that EITF 06-11 will have on our results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

." SFAS
No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract-by-contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and
insurance contracts at fair value, rather than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us in the
first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "

Fair Value Measurements.

" SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are currently
assessing the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 157 will have on our results of operations or financial position.

In
June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

." This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax
positions
taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN 48 and related interpretations are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cumulative effect of adoption will be recorded as
an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for fiscal 2008. We are currently assessing the expected impact of adopting FIN 48. Based upon our evaluation to date, we estimate that the
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings will be $100 to $200 million. This adjustment includes an estimated net increase in contingent liabilities upon adoption of FIN 48 of $300
to $400 million, excluding interest, reduced by the portion of these contingent liabilities for which Tyco International and Covidien are contractually obligated under the terms of our Tax
Sharing Agreement. See Note 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding responsibilities for unresolved legacy tax matters.


Forward-Looking Information

Certain statements in this report are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include, among others, the information concerning
our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, the
effects of competition, and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology such as the words "believe," "expect," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue," "may," "should," or the negative of these terms or
similar expressions.

Forward-looking
statements involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. You should not
put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We do not have any intention or obligation to update forward-looking statements after we file this report except as required by law.

Among
the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements are the risks described in "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors."
There may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with interest rate and
currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative
financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks.

We
do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major
financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long-term debt rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty.

Foreign Currency Exposures

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we use foreign exchange forwards and swaps. The objective is to manage our foreign
currency exposures on intercompany transactions, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar
from the September 28, 2007 market rates would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $59 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would decrease the
unrealized value of our forward contracts by $72 million. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from the September 29, 2006 market rates would increase the unrealized value of our
forward contracts by $6 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $8 million. However, such gains or losses on
these contracts would be generally offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions.

Interest Rate Exposures

We issue debt, from time to time, in capital markets to fund our operations. Such borrowings can result in interest rate and/or currency exposure. To manage these
exposures and to minimize overall interest cost, we have used and may use in the future interest rate swaps to convert a portion of the


fixed-rate
debt into variable rate debt (fair value hedges) and/or convert a portion of the variable rate debt into fixed-rate debt (cash flow hedges). At September 28,
2007, we had no outstanding interest rate swaps. Based on our floating rate debt balance of $1,250 million at September 28, 2007, an increase in the levels of the U.S. dollar interest
rates by 0.5%, with all other variables held constant, would result in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately $6 million.

Note 14 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information on financial instruments.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

This Annual Report does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of the
Company's registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies. Under the rules and regulations of the SEC, we are not required to
comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until we file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending September 26,
2008, so long as we continue to meet the definition of a non-accelerated filer. In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 26, 2008,
management and our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to provide an assessment as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.


Our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 28, 2007. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

In
our information statement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K on June 8, 2007, we disclosed a material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting relating to accounting for income taxes. As a result of this material weakness, which was not remediated as of September 28, 2007, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 28, 2007.

We
are continuing to build our tax accounting resources and capabilities to remediate this material weakness, and are implementing new control processes and procedures as part of our
efforts to become compliant with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Although we have taken several steps to strengthen controls, we continue to develop
improvements to our control processes, including:

•

enhancing
policies and procedures relating to tax account reconciliation and analysis;

•

augmenting
tax accounting resources and ensuring adequate training;

•

reinforcing
requirements for tax jurisdiction specific information with internal information providers; and

•

further
integrating tax processes with the Company's information systems.

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements


Schedule II—Valuation and Qualifying Accounts



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Tyco Electronics Ltd. Board of Directors:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated and combined balance sheets of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 28, 2007 and
September 29, 2006 and the related consolidated and combined statements of operations, equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 28, 2007.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated and combined financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and combined financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and combined financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an
audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated and combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated and combined financial position of the Company as of
September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 28, 2007, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
and combined financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, prior to its separation from Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"), the Company was
comprised of the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating the electronics businesses of Tyco International. The combined financial statements also included allocations of corporate
overhead, net class action settlement costs, other expenses, debt and related interest expense from Tyco International. These allocations may not be reflective of the actual level of costs or debt
which would have been incurred had the Company operated as a separate entity apart from Tyco International.

As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, in fiscal 2007, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).

As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, in connection with its separation from Tyco International, the Company
entered into certain guarantee commitments with Tyco International and Covidien Ltd. and has recorded the fair value of these guarantees.

As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, in fiscal 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

.


As
discussed in Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, in fiscal 2005, the Company changed the measurement date of its pension and post retirement
plans from September 30 to August 31.

TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Separation and Basis of Presentation

The Separation

Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics" or the "Company"), a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, became the
parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of its shares of Tyco
Electronics, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders (the "Separation").

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and its subsidiaries as an
independent, publicly-traded company as of and subsequent to June 29, 2007 and a combined reporting entity comprising the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating the electronics
businesses of Tyco International, including Tyco Electronics Ltd., for periods prior to June 29, 2007.

The
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ("GAAP"). The preparation of the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in these Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements include restructuring and other charges and credits, acquisition liabilities, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future cash flows associated with asset
impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, estimated contract revenue and related costs, legal liabilities, tax reserves and
deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension and postretirement employee benefit expenses. Actual results could differ materially
from these estimates.

The
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007 may not be indicative of the Company's future performance and do not
necessarily reflect what its consolidated and combined results of operations, financial position, and cash flows would have been had it operated as an independent, publicly-traded company during the
periods presented, including changes in the Company's capitalization as a result of the Separation from Tyco International. To the extent that an asset, liability, revenue, or expense is directly
associated with the Company, it is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Certain general corporate overhead, net class action settlement costs, and other
expenses as well as debt and related net interest expense for periods prior to the Separation have been allocated by Tyco International to the Company. Management believes such allocations were
reasonable; however, they may not be indicative of the actual results of the Company had the Company been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the periods presented. See
Note 17 for further information regarding allocated expenses.

Description of the Business

The Company consists of four reportable segments:

•

Electronic Components.

Principles of Consolidation

The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or controls more than fifty percent of the voting shares or otherwise has the ability to control through
similar rights. In addition, the Company consolidates variable interest entities in which the Company bears a majority of the risk to the entities' expected losses or stands to gain from a majority of
the entities' expected returns. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.

Change in Fiscal Year and Reporting Calendar Alignment

Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements to fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2005 are to Tyco Electronics'
fiscal years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005. Effective October 1, 2004, Tyco Electronics changed its fiscal year end from a calendar
fiscal year ending September 30th to a "52-53 week" year ending on the last Friday of September, such that each quarterly period is 13 weeks in length. For fiscal years in which
there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period will include 14 weeks, with the first such occurrence taking place in fiscal 2011. The impact of this change was not material to the Combined
Financial Statements. Net income for the transition period related to this change was $21 million after-tax, $29 million pre-tax, and was reported within equity.


2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

The Company's revenues are generated principally from the sale of its products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and risks and
rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This is generally when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection
is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, the Company has deferred the recognition of revenue.

The
Company provides certain distributors with an inventory allowance for returns or scrap equal to a percentage of qualified purchases. A reserve for estimated scrap and returns
allowances is established at the time of the sale based on a fixed percentage of sales to distributors authorized and agreed to by the Company and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Other
allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is recorded as a
reduction of sales. The Company believes it can reasonably and reliably estimate the amounts of future allowances.

Contract
sales for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are
based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost.
Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they
first become determinable. Contract sales for construction related projects are generated primarily within the Company's Wireless Systems and Undersea Telecommunications segments.

The
Company typically warrants that its products will conform to the Company's specifications and that its products will be free from material defects in materials and manufacturing. The
Company limits its liability to the replacement of defective parts or the cash value of replacement parts. The Company accepts returned goods only when the customer makes a claim and management has
authorized the return. Returns result primarily from defective products or shipping discrepancies. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return
experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Additionally,
certain of the Company's long-term contracts in its Wireless Systems and Undersea Telecommunications segments have warranty obligations. Estimated warranty
costs for each contract are determined based on the contract terms and technology specific considerations. These costs are included in total estimated contract costs and are accrued over the
construction period of the respective contracts under percentage-of-completion accounting.

On
September 26, 2005, the Company's Wireless Systems segment entered into a twenty year lease contract with the State of New York to construct, operate, and maintain a statewide
wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders worth $2 billion. Lease terms and payment streams begin when each of the regional networks that make up the
statewide network are determined to meet the operational requirements of the contract and are accepted by the State of New York, with the lease terms running through September 2025.


The
Company is accounting for each regional network as a stand-alone sales-type lease and will recognize seller's profit on acceptance of each region. As of fiscal 2007,
2006, and 2005, no acceptance events have occurred with any region and therefore the Company has not recognized any revenue on the construction of the network. Costs totaling $28 million and
$8 million in fiscal 2007 and
2006, respectively, associated with the development and construction of the statewide wireless network, including interest expense incurred to finance the construction, have been capitalized primarily
as inventories on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. No costs were incurred in fiscal 2005.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in cost of sales. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct
costs incurred, and building and overhead expenses. The amounts expensed in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $520 million, $467 million, and $424 million, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the Company's outstanding receivables determined on the
basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, and other currently available evidence.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market value.

Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net and Long-Lived Assets

Property, plant, and equipment, net is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense when incurred.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Buildings and related improvements

5 to 40 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of remaining term of the lease or economic useful life

Machinery and equipment

1 to 20 years

The
Company periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment, and amortizable intangible assets, relying on a
number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the
assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business. An impairment in the carrying value of an asset group is
recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value.


The
amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of
estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily
intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 3 to 50 years that are amortized on a straight-line
basis. See Note 10 for additional information regarding intangible assets. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic
basis when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. The Company assesses intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with its policy for assessing other
long-lived assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair
value on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever the Company believes a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In making this assessment, management
relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties
related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.

As
of fiscal year end 2007, the Company has 16 reporting units, of which 13 contain goodwill that is assessed for impairment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more
operating segments or reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, the Company performs a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, the Company compares the fair value of a
reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the
amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying
amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined
in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that
unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and
liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Estimates
about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting
unit. The income approach has been supported by other valuation approaches, such as similar transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate many assumptions including future growth
rates, discount factors, and income tax rates in assessing fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.


Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109,
"

Accounting for Income Taxes

." In these Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, the benefits of a consolidated return have been reflected where
such returns have or could be filed based on the entities and jurisdictions included in the financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been reflected in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and
tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss carryforwards using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is
provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Financial Instruments

In order to address certain financial exposures, the Company recently adopted a risk management program that includes the use of derivative and
non-derivative financial instruments. The Company has established policies regarding the types and notional value of derivative financial instruments that can be entered into. The Company
currently enters into foreign exchange forwards and swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and has designated certain intercompany non-derivative financial
instruments denominated in foreign currencies as a hedging of its net investments in certain foreign operations denominated in the same foreign currencies.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in the derivative's fair value are recognized currently in
earnings in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations because the
Company has not designated the derivatives as either a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge. The remeasurement of the intercompany non-derivative financial instruments designated as a
hedge of the company's net investment in foreign operations is recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets
offsetting the change in cumulative translation adjustment attributable to the Company's net investments in certain foreign operations.

The
Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments by using methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. For
the majority of financial instruments, including derivatives, standard market conventions are used to determine fair value. For financial instruments that cannot be valued by means of standard market
conventions, valuations are obtained from third-party financial institutions known to be active and significant participants in the relevant market.

During
fiscal 2007, in anticipation of issuing new fixed rate debt, the Company entered into, and concurrent with the Company's fixed rate debt issuance, terminated, forward starting
interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest expense that would result from changes in interest rates between the date of the swap and the Company's anticipated date of issuing the fixed
rate debt. These forward starting interest rate swaps were designated as effective hedges of the probable interest payments under SFAS No. 133, "

Accounting for
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

." See Note 14 for further information.


Share-Based Compensation

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, "

Share-Based Payment

," on October 1, 2005 using the modified
prospective transition method. Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company determines the fair value of share awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. That fair value is
expensed ratably over the expected service period, with an allowance made for estimated forfeitures based on historical employee activity. See Note 23 for additional information related to the
Company's share-based compensation.

Share Premium and Contributed Surplus

In accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, when the Company issues shares for cash at a premium to their par value, the resulting premium is credited to a
share premium account, a non-distributable reserve. Contributed surplus, subject to certain conditions, is a distributable reserve.

Currency Translation

For the Company's non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries with a functional currency other than U.S. dollars, assets and liabilities are
translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains
and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within equity.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, which are included in net income, were immaterial in all periods presented.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

During fiscal 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. ("FIN") 47,
"

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.

" Accordingly, the Company
recognized asset retirement obligations of $16 million and property, plant, and equipment, net of $4 million in its Combined Balance Sheet at fiscal year end 2006. In addition, the
Company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change which resulted in an $8 million after-tax, $12 million pre-tax, loss.

During
fiscal 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans from September 30th to August 31st, effective
October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement date was a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the
actuarial information in the Company's Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, the Company recorded an $11 million
after-tax, $13 million
pre-tax, gain cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal 2005. See Note 15 for additional information on the Company's retirement plans.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined
benefit pension


and
other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service
costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit
obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company currently uses a measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial
statements. The measurement date provisions will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the measurement date change provisions on its results
of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The Company adopted the funded status recognition provisions at September 28, 2007. The incremental effects of adopting the standard on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet are increases of $386 million in long-term pension and postretirement benefit liabilities, $16 million in accrued and other current liabilities,
and $55 million in other assets. The impact of adoption also resulted in additional net deferred tax assets of $122 million. The impact of adoption to accumulated other comprehensive
income, a component of equity, was a reduction of $225 million. There was no impact on pension or other postretirement benefit expense, cash flows, or benefits plans in fiscal 2007.
On-going compliance with the standard will not impact pension or other postretirement benefit expense, cash flows, or benefit plans. See Note 15 for further discussion of the
implementation of the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158.

In
September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108, "

Considering the Effect of Prior
Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.

" SAB No. 108 provides guidance on evaluating the materiality of prior periods'
misstatements, quantifying the effects of correcting misstatements in the current period and criteria for restatement of prior periods. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after
November 15, 2006. The Company adopted this guidance effective for fiscal 2007. This adoption did not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, "

Business Combinations

." SFAS No. 141R replaces
SFAS No. 141 and addresses the recognition and accounting for identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in business combinations. SFAS No. 141R is
effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 141R will have on its results of operations, financial position, or
cash flows.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

." SFAS
No. 160 addresses the accounting and reporting framework for minority interests by a parent company. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The
Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 160 will have on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
June 2007, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF Issue No. 06-11, "

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
Share-Based Payment Awards

." EITF 06-11 requires that a realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalent units paid on unvested restricted
shares and restricted share units be reflected as an increase in contributed surplus and reflected as an addition to the Company's excess tax benefit pool, as defined under
SFAS No. 123R. EITF 06-11 is effective for


the
Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact that EITF 06-11 will have on its results of operations, financial position, or cash
flows.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.

" SFAS
No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract-by-contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and
insurance contracts at fair value, rather than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the Company
in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "

Fair Value Measurements.

" SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The
Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 157 will have on its results of operations or financial position.

In
June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

." This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN 48 and related interpretations are effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cumulative effect of adoption
will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for fiscal 2008. The Company is currently assessing the expected impact of adopting FIN 48. Based upon its evaluation to
date, the Company estimates that the adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings will be $100 to $200 million. This adjustment includes an estimated net increase in contingent
liabilities upon adoption of FIN 48 of $300 to $400 million, excluding interest, reduced by the portion of these contingent liabilities for which Tyco International and Covidien are
contractually obligated under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 17 for additional information regarding responsibilities for unresolved legacy tax matters.

3. Separation Costs

In connection with the Separation, the Company incurred costs of $45 million in fiscal 2007, primarily related to employee costs, including
non-cash compensation expense of $11 million related to the modification of share option awards at Separation and $13 million related to the acceleration of restricted share
award vesting as a result of Separation. See Note 23 for further information on the conversion of Tyco International share option awards into Tyco Electronics share option awards and the
acceleration of restricted share award vesting.

During
fiscal 2006, the Printed Circuit Group business was accounted for as held for sale and related restructuring liabilities were reclassified accordingly. During
fiscal 2007, the Printed Circuit Group business was sold and $8 million of restructuring liabilities were retained by the Company. See Note 5 for additional information.

(2)

The
Tyco Global Network was accounted for as held for sale during fiscal 2004 and related restructuring liabilities were reclassified accordingly. In fiscal 2005, the
Tyco Global Network was sold and $39 million of restructuring liabilities were retained by the Company. In addition, the Company transferred $4 million of severance liabilities from
liability held for sale as a result of the sale of the Tyco Global Network. See Note 5 for additional information.


Fiscal 2007 Actions

The Company initiated restructuring programs during fiscal 2007 relating to the exit of manufacturing operations and the migration of product lines to low cost
countries in the Electronic Components and Network Solutions segments and the rationalization of certain product lines in the Wireless Systems segment. In connection with these actions, during fiscal
2007, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $72 million primarily related to employee severance and benefits. The Company expects to complete all restructuring activities commenced in
fiscal 2007 by the end of fiscal 2009 and to incur additional charges of approximately $30 million relating to these initiated actions by completion.

Fiscal 2006 Actions

During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $14 million primarily related to employee severance and benefits. These charges included
the elimination of 166 positions. As of fiscal year end 2007, the remaining restructuring reserve related to the fiscal 2006 actions is $2 million.

Fiscal 2005 Actions

During fiscal 2005, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $8 million related to employee severance and benefits. These charges included the
elimination of 802 positions. In addition, the
Company transferred $4 million of severance liabilities from liability held for sale as a result of the sale of the Tyco Global Network. As of fiscal year end 2007, all actions under these
plans are complete.

Pre-Fiscal 2005 Actions

During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $798 million primarily related to a significant downturn in the telecommunications
industry and certain other end markets. These actions have been completed. As of fiscal year end 2007, the remaining restructuring reserves related to the fiscal 2002 actions are $65 million,
relating to exited lease facilities. During fiscal 2007, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $5 million for interest accretion on these reserves. The Company expects that its
remaining reserves will continue to be paid out over the expected terms of the obligations which range from one to fifteen years.

Non-Cash Charges and Credits

During fiscal 2007, the Company recorded non-cash charges of $21 million primarily related to fixed assets in connection with exited
manufacturing operations and $5 million in cost of goods sold for write-downs in carrying value of inventory related to exited product lines.

During
fiscal 2006, the Company recorded non-cash charges of $10 million, including $6 million in cost of goods sold for write-downs in carrying value of
inventory related to exited product lines. Also, during fiscal 2005, the Company completed exit activities related to previously acquired operations for which goodwill had been fully impaired in prior
years. As these activities were completed for amounts less than originally established as acquisition liabilities, the Company recorded the reversal of the acquisition liabilities as a restructuring
and other credit of $4 million.

During
fiscal 2005, the Company sold assets which were previously written down to their net realizable value in fiscal 2002 for amounts greater than originally estimated and recorded
related gains


as
restructuring and other credits of $9 million. Also, during fiscal 2005, the Company completed exit activities related to previously acquired operations for which goodwill had been fully
impaired in prior years. As these activities were completed for amounts less than originally established as acquisition liabilities, the Company recorded the reversal of the acquisition liabilities as
a restructuring and other credit of $7 million.

5. Discontinued Operations and Divestitures

Discontinued Operations

The divestiture of the Company's Power Systems business was authorized during fiscal 2007. As a result, the Company assessed Power Systems' assets for impairment
under SFAS No. 144, "

Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

," using a probability-weighted set of expected
cash flows from the eventual disposition. The Company determined that the book value of the Power Systems business exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded a $435 million
after-tax, $585 million pre-tax, impairment charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 in loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated and
Combined Statement of Operations. Subsequent to year end, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Power Systems business. See Note 26 for additional information.

During
fiscal 2006, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to divest the Printed Circuit Group business. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company consummated the
sale of the


Printed
Circuit Group business for $227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre-tax gain on the sale.

The
Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods
presented. Prior to reclassification as held for sale, both the Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group business were components of the Other segment, which has been renamed the Undersea
Telecommunications segment.

The
following table reflects net sales, pre-tax loss from discontinued operations, pre-tax gain on sale of discontinued operations including impairments and costs

Gain on Divestiture

During fiscal 2005, the Company agreed to sell the Tyco Global Network, its undersea fiber optic telecommunication network that was part of the Undersea
Telecommunications segment. The sale was consummated on June 30, 2005. As part of the sale transaction, the Company received gross cash


proceeds
of $130 million and the purchaser assumed certain liabilities. In connection with this sale, the Company recorded a $301 million pre-tax gain which is reflected in
gain on divestiture in the Combined Statement of Operations for fiscal 2005. The Company has presented the operations of the Tyco Global Network in continuing operations as the criteria for
discontinued operations were not met.

6. Acquisitions

Acquisitions

During fiscal 2006, the Company acquired one business for an aggregate cost of $18 million and acquired the remaining interest in a joint venture for
$5 million. The Company acquired one business for an aggregate cost of $8 million and acquired the remaining interest in a joint venture for $4 million in fiscal 2005. These
acquisitions were funded utilizing cash generated from operations. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Holdback and Earn-Out Liabilities

The Company paid cash related to holdback and earn-out liabilities of approximately $1 million, $82 million, and $2 million
during fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, relating to certain prior period acquisitions. The total cash paid in fiscal 2006 was reported in discontinued operations as it related to the Printed
Circuit Group business. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other
pre-acquisition contingencies. Additionally, certain acquisitions have provisions that would require the Company to make additional contingent purchase price payments to the sellers if the
acquired company achieves certain milestones subsequent to its acquisition by the Company. These payments are tied to certain performance measures, such as sales, gross margin, or earnings growth and
generally are treated as additional purchase price.

At
fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, holdback and earn-out liabilities of $60 million and $54 million, respectively, were included in other liabilities on the
Company's Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets.

The
current portion of long-term debt at September 28, 2007 was comprised of $5 million of the amount shown as other. At
September 29, 2006, the current portion of long-term debt was comprised of $285 million due to Tyco International Ltd. and affiliates and $6 million of
the amount shown as other.

During September 2007, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $800 million
principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, $750 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $500 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due
2037, all of which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TEGSA offered the senior notes in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities
Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). In addition, the initial purchasers, through their respective selling agents, sold less than one-half of one percent of the senior notes outside the U.S. pursuant
to Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with the issuance of the senior notes, TEGSA and the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers
under which TEGSA and the Company agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the senior notes, to file with the SEC an exchange offer registration statement within 210 days after the date of the
original issue of the notes. Net proceeds from the sales of the senior notes were used to repay a portion of borrowings under the unsecured senior bridge loan facility.

In
April 2007, TEGSA entered into a $2,800 million unsecured senior bridge loan facility. The Company is the guarantor of the bridge facility which had an original maturity
date of April 23, 2008. On August 31, 2007, the Company and TEGSA amended the unsecured bridge loan facility to permit, at TEGSA's option, an extension of the maturity from
April 23, 2008 to April 22, 2009. Borrowings under the bridge facility bear interest, at TEGSA's option, at a base rate or the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin
dependent on TEGSA's credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points depending on its credit ratings. The
bridge facility contains provisions that may require mandatory prepayments or reduction of unused commitments if the Company or TEGSA issues debt or equity. In May 2007, tranche B was added to
the bridge facility, increasing the amount of the facility by $775 million. All balances under tranche B of the facility were paid off and all commitments under tranche B were cancelled in
August 2007. Borrowings under the bridge facility were used to fund a portion of Tyco International's debt tender offers, to repay a portion of Tyco International's existing


bank
credit facilities, and to fund the Company's portion of Tyco International's class action settlement escrow. See Note 16 for further information regarding the class action settlement.

Additionally,
in April 2007, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. The Company is the guarantor of the revolving credit facility.
The commitments under the revolving credit facility are $1,500 million. Interest and fees under the revolving credit facility are substantially the same as under the bridge loan facility. The
revolving credit facility will be used for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes.

As
of September 28, 2007, TEGSA had $700 million outstanding under the five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility, which bore interest at the rate of
5.38%. Also, as of September 28, 2007, TEGSA had $550 million of indebtedness outstanding under the unsecured bridge loan facility, which bore interest at the rate of 5.47%.

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company conducted a tender offer to purchase for cash its subsidiary's 7.2% notes due 2008 amounting to $86 million. Approximately
$67 million, or 78%, of the notes were tendered and extinguished.

The
Company's debt agreements contain financial and other customary covenants. None of these covenants are presently considered restrictive to the Company's operations. As of
September 28, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.

The
September 2007 senior notes referred to above are subject to an exchange and registration rights agreement under which if certain registration requirements are not met by the
required time or registration is withdrawn or is subject to an effective stop order, there may be a registration default, requiring payment by the Company of liquidated damages in the form of special
interest at a rate of
0.25% per annum for the first 90 days of such registration default, and at a rate of 0.50% thereafter, until such registration default is cured. As of September 28, 2007, the Company has
determined that the likelihood of a registration default is remote and has not accrued any special interest.

Tyco
International's consolidated debt, exclusive of amounts incurred directly by the Company, was proportionately allocated to the Company at September 29, 2006 based on the
historical funding requirements of the Company using historical data. The allocated debt amounts, presented as "Due to Tyco International Ltd. and affiliates," were classified on the Combined
Balance Sheet at September 29, 2006 based on the maturities of Tyco International's underlying debt.

Net
interest expense was allocated in the same proportions as debt through June 1, 2007 and includes the impact of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges.
For fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, Tyco International has allocated to Tyco Electronics interest expense of $150 million, $234 million, and $271 million, respectively, and interest
income of $20 million, $33 million, and $32 million, respectively.

In
addition, Tyco International has allocated to the Company loss on retirement of debt in the amount of $232 million and $365 million for fiscal 2007 and 2005,
respectively. Such amounts are included in other expense, net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. The method utilized to allocate loss on retirement of debt is consistent with
the allocation of debt and net interest expense as described above.

Management
believes the allocation basis for debt, net interest expense, and loss on retirement of debt was reasonable based on the historical financing needs of the Company. However,
these amounts


may
not be indicative of the actual amounts that the Company would have incurred had it been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the periods presented.

The
fair value of the Company's debt was approximately $3,413 million at fiscal year end 2007. At fiscal year end 2006, the fair value of the Company's external debt, which
excludes amounts allocated by Tyco International, was approximately $155 million. For further detail of methods and assumptions used in determining fair value, see Note 2.

The
aggregate amounts of total debt, maturing during the next five years and thereafter are as follows:

The
unsecured senior bridge loan facility of $550 million is classified as long-term as a result of the Company's August 31, 2007 amendment to the facility.
On the maturity schedule above, the $550 million is presented as maturing in fiscal 2008.

Certain
of the Company's operating subsidiaries have overdraft or similar types of facilities, which totaled $51 million, of which $47 million was undrawn and available at
fiscal year end 2007. These facilities, most of which are renewable, expire at various dates through the year 2010 and are established primarily within the Company's international operations.

13. Guarantees

Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, the Company entered into certain guarantee commitments and
indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%,
respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify the Company for 69% of all
liabilities settled by the Company with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, the Company has made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien
with respect to 31% of all liabilities settled by the companies with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to
default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, the Company would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation.

The
Company's indemnification created under the Tax Sharing Agreement qualifies as a guarantee of a third party entity's debt under FIN 45, "

Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

." FIN 45 addresses the measurement and disclosure of a
guarantor's obligation to pay a debt incurred by a third party. To value the initial obligation under FIN 45, the Company considered a range of probability-weighted future cash flows that represent
the likelihood of payment of each class of liability by each of the three post-Separation


companies.
The future cash flows incorporate interest and penalties that the companies believe will be incurred on each class of liabilities and are discounted to the present value to reflect the
value associated with each as of September 28, 2007. The FIN 45 calculation includes a premium that reflects the cost for an insurance carrier to stand in and assume the payment obligation.
Because the future cash flows include a consideration of all tax positions, both asserted and unasserted, the FIN 45 fair value is reduced by the Company's accrual of 31% of all asserted tax
liabilities on the books of Tyco International and Covidien.

Based
on the probability-weighted future cash flows related to the unresolved tax matters, the Company, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, faces a maximum potential liability of
$3 billion, based on undiscounted estimates and interest and penalties used to determine the fair value of the FIN 45 guarantee and an assumption of 100% default on the parts of Tyco
International and Covidien, a likelihood that management believes to be remote. In the event that the Company is required, due to bankruptcy or other business interruption on the part of Tyco
International or Covidien, to pay more than the contractually determined 31%, the Company retains the right to seek payment from the effected entity.

At
Separation, the probability-weighted cash flows and risk premium resulted in a fair value of the FIN 45 liability of $338 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, a
review of tax reserves held by the Company, Tyco International, and Covidien resulted in approximately $134 million of tax reserves on the books of Tyco International and Covidien being
transferred to the Company. As a result of recording those liabilities, the Company re-assessed its FIN 45 liability and decreased it by $42 million to $296 million. The
total liability of $296 million under FIN 45 consists of two components. The first component is a SFAS No. 5, "

Accounting for
Contingencies

," liability that represents the asserted liabilities that either Tyco International or Covidien have determined to be probable and estimable totaling
$198 million. The remaining $98 million represents the fair value of the 31% indemnification made to Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. The initial
liability at Separation and the transfer made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were reflected as adjustments to contributed surplus on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Upon
Separation, the Company assumed $930 million of contingent tax liabilities from Tyco International which was recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, these liabilities, coupled with pre-existing tax liabilities, resulted in the Company recording a receivable of $675 million from Tyco International and
Covidien to reflect the
69% indemnification granted by each, which was recorded in receivable from Tyco International Ltd. and Covidien Ltd. on the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon Separation. During the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2007, in conjunction with the review of tax reserves discussed in the above paragraph, the Company assumed an additional $161 million in tax reserves, of which $27 million
represents accrued interest, resulting in total income tax liabilities assumed as a result of Separation of $1,091 million, which is recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As a result of assuming these liabilities, the Company has recorded a receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in the amount of $844 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate
to unknown conditions.


However,
the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The
Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty see Note 2.

14. Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, debt, and derivative
financial instruments. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, external debt, and derivative financial instruments approximated book value at
fiscal year end 2007 and 2006. See Note 12 for the fair value estimates of external debt.

To
the extent that Tyco International entered into hedges on behalf of the Company prior to Separation, the statement of operations effects of those hedges have been allocated to the
Company as part of the Tyco International general corporate overhead expense allocation or interest expense allocation as appropriate. See Note 17.

The
cash flows related to derivative financial instruments are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flow.

Foreign Exchange Risks

As permitted under the Company's risk management program and policies, the Company uses derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage
certain exposures to foreign currency risks.

As
part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company utilizes foreign exchange forwards and swaps. The objective of these contracts is to minimize
impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany transactions, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and forecasted cash transactions. These
contracts are marked to market with changes in the derivatives fair value recognized currently in earnings in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statements
of Operations. At fiscal year end 2007, the Company had net liabilities of $8 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these transactions.


The
Company centrally manages the cash of most of its subsidiaries. To convert foreign currency cash flows in a cost effective manner, the Company enters into currency swaps and foreign
exchange forwards. The terms of these instruments are generally less than one year. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are largely offsetting and
are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company issues debt, from time to time, in capital markets to fund its operations. Such borrowings can result in interest rate and/or currency exposure. To
manage these exposures and to minimize overall interest cost, the Company has used and may use in the future interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into variable
rate debt (fair value hedges) and/or convert a portion of its variable rate debt into fixed rate debt (cash flow hedges). At the end of September 28, 2007, the Company had no outstanding
interest rate swaps.

During
fiscal 2007, in anticipation of issuing new fixed rate debt, the Company entered into, and concurrent with the Company's fixed rate debt issuance, terminated, forward starting
interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest expense that would result from changes in interest rates between the date of the swap and the Company's anticipated date of issuing fixed rate
debt. These forward starting interest rate swaps were designated as effective hedges of the probable interest payments under SFAS No. 133. Upon the issuance of the Company's new debt, these
swaps were terminated for a cash payment of $54 million. The effective portion of these swaps of $53 million was recorded in other comprehensive income and will be recognized in earnings
as interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt instruments. The ineffective portion of $1 million was recorded as interest expense in the Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements.

Hedge of Net Investment

The Company hedges its net investments in certain foreign operations using intercompany non-derivative financial instruments denominated in the same
currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $3.7 billion at September 28, 2007. As a result of the hedges of net investment, $118 million of foreign exchange loss
was reclassified to cumulative translation adjustment, a component of other comprehensive income, for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007. The Company did not hedge net investments in
foreign operations during fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005.

The
Company's derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks; however, concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated as the Company deals with a variety
of major banks worldwide with long-term Standard & Poor's and Moody's credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, only conventional derivative financial instruments are utilized,
thereby affording optimum clarity as to the determination of the market risk. None of the Company's derivative financial instruments outstanding at year end would result in a significant loss to the
Company if a counterparty failed to perform according to the terms of its agreement. At this time, the Company does not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to
its derivative financial instruments.


15. Retirement Plans

Measurement Date

In fiscal 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans from September 30th to August 31st,
effective October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement date was a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report
the actuarial information in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. Accordingly, all amounts presented as of and for the fiscal years ended 2006
and 2005 reflect an August 31st measurement date, while prior years reflect a September 30th measurement date. The Company has accounted for the change in measurement date as a change in
accounting principle. The cumulative effect of the accounting principle change as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 was an $11 million after-tax, $13 million
pre-tax, gain. The change in measurement date did not have a material effect on net periodic benefit costs.

Adoption of SFAS No. 158

As disclosed in Note 2, the Company adopted the funded status recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective September 28, 2007. The
following table summarizes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007:

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Prior to Separation, the Company participated through its former parent, Tyco International, in a number of contributory and noncontributory defined benefit
retirement plans. Subsequent to Separation, the Company assumed sponsorship of those plans, covering certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with local custom
and practice. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on periodic actuarial valuations which use the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the Consolidated and Combined
Statements of Operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Contribution amounts are determined based on the advice of professionally
qualified actuaries in the countries concerned. The benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

Prior
to Separation, the Company participated through its former parent in one co-mingled plan that included plan participants of other Tyco International subsidiaries. The
Company recorded its portion of the co-mingled plan's expense and the related obligation, which has been actuarially determined based on the Company's specific benefit formulas by
participants and allocated plan assets. The contribution amounts were determined in total for the co-mingled plan and allocated to the Company based on headcount. Management believes such
allocations were reasonable. In fiscal 2007, this plan was legally separated, resulting in a reallocation of assets based on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") prescribed
calculation which will result in adjustments to the components of the net amount recognized and future expense.


The
net periodic benefit (credit) cost for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 was as follows:

In
determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance
expectations as provided by their external advisors.

The
investment strategy for the U.S. pension plans has been governed by the Company's Investment Committee; investment strategies for non-U.S. pension plans are governed locally.
The Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent
level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants.


Target
weighted-average asset allocations and weighted average asset allocations for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006 were as follows:

Tyco
Electronics' common shares are not a direct investment of the Company's pension funds; however, the pension funds may indirectly include Tyco Electronics shares. The aggregate
amount of the Tyco Electronics common shares would not be considered material relative to the total pension fund assets.

The
Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates as well as to make discretionary voluntary
contributions from time-to-time. The Company anticipates that, at a minimum, it will make the minimum required contributions to its pension plans in fiscal 2008 of
$4 million for U.S. plans and $66 million for non-U.S. plans.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, which include 401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing
and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants' compensation and was $72 million, $69 million, and
$68 million for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans

The Company maintains nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A record keeping account
is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds correspond to a number of funds in
Tyco Electronics' 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Total deferred compensation liabilities were $37 million and $27 million at
fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, respectively. Deferred compensation expense was immaterial in all years presented.


Rabbi Trusts

The Company has established rabbi trusts, related to certain acquired companies, through which the assets may be used to pay non-qualified plan
benefits. The trusts primarily hold bonds. The rabbi trust assets are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of the Company's insolvency. The value of the assets held by these
trusts, included in Other assets on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets, was $89 million and $87 million at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total liabilities
related to the assets held by the rabbi trust and reflected on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet were $25 million and $28 million at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Plan participants are general creditors of the Company with respect to these benefits.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension and 401(k) benefits, the Company also provides certain health care coverage continuation for qualifying retirees from date of
retirement to age 65.

The
Company also has purchase obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services. At fiscal year end 2007, the Company had commitments to spend $93 million
in fiscal 2008.

At
fiscal year end 2007, the Company also had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net by the Wireless
Systems segment. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of
Florida is finished and the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded in the Company's Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements as the outcome of this contingency currently is not estimable.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

As
a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into upon Separation, any existing or potential liabilities related to Tyco International's outstanding litigation were
assigned to the Company if Tyco Electronics was specifically identified in the lawsuit. However, any existing or potential liabilities that could not be associated with Tyco Electronics were allocated
appropriately and post-separation sharing agreements were established. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for a description of Tyco International's various significant
outstanding litigation proceedings. Tyco Electronics will be responsible for certain potential liabilities that may arise upon the settlement of the pending litigation based on the
post-separation sharing agreement. If Tyco International or Covidien


were
to default on their obligation to pay their allocated share of these liabilities, however, the Company would be required to pay additional amounts.

Class Actions

As a result of actions taken by certain of Tyco International's former senior corporate management, Tyco International, some members of Tyco International's
former senior corporate management, former members of Tyco International's board of directors, Tyco International's former General Counsels and former Chief Financial Officer, and Tyco International's
current Chief Executive Officer are named defendants in a number of purported class actions alleging violations of the disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws. Tyco International, certain
of its current and former employees, some members of its former senior corporate management, and some former members of its board of directors also are named as defendants in several ERISA class
actions. Tyco International is generally obligated to indemnify its directors and officers and its former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the
extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, Tyco International's insurance carriers may decline coverage, or Tyco International's coverage may be insufficient to cover its expenses and liability, in
some or all of these matters.

On
May 14, 2007, Tyco International entered into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs' counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 purported securities class action
lawsuits. The memorandum of understanding does not resolve all securities cases, and several remain outstanding. In addition, the proposed settlement does not release claims arising under ERISA.

Under
the terms of the memorandum of understanding, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against Tyco International, the other settling defendants, and ten other individuals in
consideration for the payment of $2,975 million from Tyco International to the certified class and assignment to the class of any net recovery of any claims possessed by Tyco International and
the other settling defendants against Tyco International's former auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers. Defendant PricewaterhouseCoopers was not a settling defendant and is not a party to the memorandum.
However, PricewaterhouseCoopers subsequently agreed to participate in the settlement as a settling defendant, and in consideration of a release of all claims against it by the parties to the
memorandum of understanding, agreed to make a payment of $225 million. Tyco International and the other settling defendants have denied and continue to deny any wrongdoing and legal liability
arising from any of the facts or conduct alleged in the actions. The parties to the memorandum of understanding applied to the court for approval of the settlement agreement. On July 13, 2007,
the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On November 2, 2007, the final fairness hearing for the class settlement was held, and the court indicated it would approve the
settlement and stated a formal ruling would be issued shortly. If the settlement agreement does not receive final court approval, the memorandum of understanding will be null and void. By
December 28, 2007, class participants must file their proofs of claim demonstrating their right to recovery under the class settlement.

Under
the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement that was entered into in connection with the Separation, Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company are jointly and
severally liable for the full amount of the class action settlement. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability and related escrow account with
Tyco International assuming 27%, Covidien 42%, and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total settlement amount.

In
the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company was allocated a charge from Tyco International of $922 million, for which no tax benefit was available. In addition, in fiscal
2007, the Company was


allocated
$35 million of income relating to Tyco International's expected recovery of certain costs from insurers, of which $31 million has been collected. The net charge of
$887 million has been recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations as allocated class action settlement costs, net. The portions allocated to the Company are consistent
with the sharing percentage included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Tyco International placed funds in escrow for the benefit of the class. The escrow account earns interest that is
payable to the class. In addition, interest is accrued on the class action settlement liability. At fiscal year end 2007, the Company recorded $928 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for
its portion of the escrow. In addition, the Company recorded a $2,992 million liability and a $2,064 million receivable from Tyco International and Covidien for their portion of the
liability at fiscal year end 2007.

If
the proposed settlement were not consummated on the agreed terms or if the unresolved proceedings were to be determined adversely to Tyco International, the Company's share of any
additional potential losses, which are not presently estimable, may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Investigations

Tyco International and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the SEC's Division of Enforcement, the U.S. Department of Labor, the General
Service Administration, and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into Tyco International's governance, management, operations, accounting,
and related controls. The Department of Labor is investigating Tyco International and the administrators of certain of its benefit plans. Tyco International has advised the Company that it cannot
predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can it predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that Tyco International will be required to pay material fines
or suffer other penalties. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. As a result, Tyco
Electronics share of such potential losses also is not estimable and may have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Compliance Matters

Tyco International has received and responded to various allegations that certain improper payments were made by Tyco International subsidiaries, including Tyco
Electronics subsidiaries, in recent years. During 2005 and 2006, Tyco International reported to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it
had taken in response to the allegations. Tyco International also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of its policies,
controls, and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies, and that it would
present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. Tyco International and Tyco Electronics have had communications with the DOJ and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review
being conducted by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper payments identified by Tyco International and the Company in the course
of the Company's ongoing compliance activities. To date, the baseline review has revealed that some business practices may not comply with Tyco International and FCPA requirements. At this time, the
Company cannot predict the outcome of other allegations reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of


potential
loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of any or all of these matters. However, it is possible that the Company may be required to pay judgments, suffer
penalties, or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Any judgment, settlement, or other cost incurred by
Tyco International in connection with these matters would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which provides that any liabilities not primarily
related to any of the businesses of Tyco International, Covidien, or Tyco Electronics will be shared equally among the companies.

Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation

The Company is a party to a number of patent infringement and antitrust actions that may require the Company to pay damage awards. The Company has assessed the
status of these matters and has recorded liabilities related to certain of these matters where appropriate.

Environmental Matters

The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of
site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. As of
fiscal year end 2007, the Company concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $12 million to $23 million. As of fiscal year end 2007,
the Company concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $16 million, of which $3 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and
$13 million is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters of $16 million, the
Company believes that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Income Taxes

The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities,
including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company and Tyco International are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax
adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable and which relate specifically to the Tyco
Electronics business have been recorded in the Company's Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. In addition, the Company may be required to pay additional taxes for contingencies not related
to the electronics businesses as a result of the tax liability sharing arrangements with Tyco International and Covidien entered into upon Separation.

In
fiscal 2004, in connection with the IRS audit of the fiscal 1997 through 2000 years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S.
federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During fiscal 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. Also during fiscal 2006,
Tyco International developed proposed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through fiscal 2002. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has
determined that


acceptance
of these adjustments is probable and, accordingly, has recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
These adjustments resulted in a $205 million net decrease in deferred income tax assets and a $205 million decrease in income taxes in fiscal 2006. Such adjustments did not have a
material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, Tyco International completed proposed amendments to a portion of its U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2001 through 2005 fiscal periods,
which primarily reflected the roll forward of the previous amendments for the 1997 to 2002 fiscal periods. These adjustments resulted in a $9 million increase to the tax provision on the
Company's Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in fiscal 2007. Tyco International continues to complete proposed adjustments to the remainder of its U.S. federal income tax returns for
periods subsequent to fiscal 2002. When the Company's tax return positions are updated, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. While the final
adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, the Company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on its financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 though 2000 and
issued anticipated Revenue Agents' Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The Revenue Agents' Reports propose tax audit adjustments to
certain of Tyco International's previously filed tax return positions, all of which Tyco International expected and previously assessed at each balance sheet date. Accordingly, the Company has made no
additional provision during fiscal 2007 with respect to its share of the proposed audit adjustments in the Revenue Agents' Reports.

Tyco
International has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact to Tyco International of $458 million, and during the third
quarter of fiscal 2007, Tyco International paid $458 million. The Company's portion of this payment reduced income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet by $163 million. Currently, it
is the Company's understanding that Tyco International will appeal other proposed tax audit adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion and intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax
return positions. The Company continues to believe that the amounts recorded in its Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements relating to these tax adjustments are sufficient. However, the
ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of
these matters could result in Tyco International filing amended U.S.
federal income tax returns for years subsequent to the current fiscal 1997 to 2000 audit period and could have a material impact on the Company's effective tax rate in future reporting periods.

Additionally,
the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of
stock in 1998 and 1999. Based on statutory guidelines, the Company estimates the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. Any penalty imposed would be subject
to sharing with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Currently, it is the Company's understanding that Tyco International will vigorously oppose the assertion of any such
penalties.

In
connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidien's, Tyco Electronics' and Tyco International's respective rights,


responsibilities,
and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution
of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Internal
Revenue Code (the "Code") or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code.

Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, the Company has entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with
Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain
contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify the Company for 69% of all liabilities settled by the
Company with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, the Company has made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of all
liabilities settled by the companies with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs
or expenses related to any such liability, the Company would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation.

Upon
Separation, $930 million of Tyco International's contingent tax liabilities related to unresolved tax matters were transferred to the Company in accordance with the Tax
Sharing Agreement. In addition, the Company recorded a receivable from Tyco International and Covidien of $675 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 29, 2007 relating to
indemnifications made by Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, an analysis of the tax reserves held by the Company, Tyco
International, and Covidien indicated that the Company is the primary obligor for an additional $161 million of tax and related interest for which reserves had been recorded on the books of
Tyco International and Covidien. Accordingly, the amounts recorded by the Company upon Separation for contingent tax liabilities and the corresponding assets for
indemnifications made by Tyco International and Covidien were increased to reflect these additional amounts. The initial liability at Separation and the adjustment made in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2007 were reflected as adjustments to contributed surplus on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The
Company's contractual obligation under the Tax Sharing Agreement is 31% of legacy Tyco International contingent tax liabilities, or $675 million. This net obligation is
comprised of shared contingent tax liabilities of $1,223 million, adjusted for the contractual obligations among the parties to the Tax Sharing Agreement. These contractual obligations consist
of a $844 million receivable from Tyco International and Covidien related to the Company's shared contingent tax liabilities, a $198 million liability applicable to Tyco International
and Covidien contingent tax liabilities, and a $98 million liability under FIN 45 related to the estimated fair value of future indemnifications made under the Tax Sharing Agreement. See
further discussion in Note 13. The actual amounts that the Company may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under this agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax
matters, which may not be resolved for several years. See Note 17 for additional information regarding the Company's responsibility for contingent tax liabilities.


Other Matters

The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions, and dispositions. The Company
does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

17. Related Party Transactions

Trade Activity

Prior to Separation, the Company sold certain of its manufactured products consisting primarily of connectors and cable assemblies to Tyco International and its
affiliates, at prices which approximated
fair value. Sales to Tyco International and its affiliates, which are included in net sales on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations, were $60 million during the first nine
months of fiscal 2007 and $76 million in both fiscal 2006 and 2005.

Cash

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company transferred $27 million of funds to Tyco International to adjust for differences between the
Company's cash balance at June 29, 2007 and its final cash balance as determined in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement. This transfer has been recorded as an adjustment
to contributed surplus on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Debt and Related Items

The Company was allocated a portion of Tyco International's consolidated debt, net interest expense, and loss on retirement of debt. See Note 12 for
further information regarding these allocations.

Allocated Expenses

In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company was allocated a net charge from Tyco International of $887 million related to the class action settlement.
See Note 16 for further information regarding the class action settlement.

Prior
to Separation, the Company was allocated general corporate overhead expenses from Tyco International for corporate-related functions based on a pro-rata percentage of
Tyco International's consolidated net revenue. General corporate overhead expenses primarily related to centralized corporate functions, including treasury, tax, legal, internal audit, human
resources, and risk management functions. During fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company was allocated $152 million, $177 million, and $198 million, respectively, of general
corporate overhead expenses incurred by Tyco International, which are included within selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations.


As discussed in Note 1, the Company believes the assumptions and methodologies underlying the allocation of general corporate overhead expenses and net
class action settlement costs from Tyco International were reasonable. However, such expenses may not be indicative of the actual level of expenses that would have been or will be incurred by the
Company if it were to operate as an independent, publicly-traded company. As such, the financial information herein may not necessarily reflect the consolidated and combined financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows of the Company in the future or what it would have been had the Company been an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented.

Transactions with Tyco Electronics' and Tyco International's Directors

During fiscal 2007, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where Tyco Electronics' directors were employed
and served as officers. Purchases from such companies aggregated less than one percent of net sales in fiscal 2007. In addition, during periods prior to the Separation in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005,
the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where Tyco International's directors were employed and served as officers. During each of these periods,
Tyco Electronics' purchases from such companies aggregated less than one percent of net sales.

Separation and Distribution Agreement

Upon Separation, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements with Tyco International and Covidien to effect the
Separation and provide a framework for the Company's relationships with Tyco International and Covidien after the distribution of the Company's and Covidien's shares to Tyco International's
shareholders (the "Distribution"). These agreements govern the relationships among Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company subsequent to the Separation and provide for the allocation to the
Company and Covidien of certain of Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to the Separation.

Under
the Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements, subject to certain exceptions contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company, Covidien, and Tyco International
assumed 31%, 42%, and 27%, respectively, of certain of Tyco International's contingent and other corporate liabilities. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and
other corporate liabilities will be shared equally among the parties. These contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to consolidated securities litigation and any actions with
respect to the Separation or the Distribution brought by any third party. If any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment, when due, of any of these assumed obligations,
each non-defaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other non-defaulting party the amounts in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, Tyco
Electronics may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed-upon share of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities, including associated
costs and expenses.

Tax Sharing Agreement

Upon Separation, the Company entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, under which the Company shares responsibility for certain of its, Tyco International's, and
Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. The Company, Covidien, and Tyco International share 31%, 42%, and 27%,
respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to its, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns.


The
effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify the Company for 69% of all liabilities settled by the Company with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification,
the Company has made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of all liabilities settled by the companies relating to unresolved legacy tax matters. All costs
and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities shall be shared equally among the parties. The Company will be responsible for all of its own taxes that are not shared
pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien will be responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's
sharing formula.

All
of the tax liabilities of Tyco International that were associated with Tyco International subsidiaries that are included in Tyco Electronics following the Separation became Tyco
Electronics' tax liabilities upon Separation. Although Tyco Electronics has agreed to share certain tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco
Electronics remains primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco International and Covidien default on their obligations to Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco Electronics
would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law
for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed upon share of its, Tyco
International's, and Covidien's tax liabilities.

Excludes

In fiscal year 2007, no tax benefits were recorded related to the pre-tax charges for the class action settlement and loss on
retirement of debt. The net increase of $26 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in fiscal 2007 reflects the tax impacts of increased borrowings as a result of the class action
settlement and the Company's separation from Tyco International.

The
net decrease of $268 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in fiscal 2006 is primarily driven by improved profitability in certain jurisdictions, principally the
U.S. The Company's U.S. results of operations in fiscal 2006 combined with other available evidence, including projections of future taxable income, indicate that it is more likely than not the
Company will realize additional deferred tax assets in the future and accordingly the related valuation allowances were reduced.


Reflected
in the state tax provision line for fiscal 2006 is a $39 million state tax benefit primarily related to the Tyco Global Network divestiture.

The
allocated loss on retirement of debt in fiscal 2006 is a cumulative one-time benefit of $87 million associated with the receipt of a favorable non-U.S.
tax ruling permitting the deduction of historical debt retirement costs. This benefit is partially offset by an increased valuation allowance of $62 million relating to the deferred tax asset
associated with net operating losses created by the debt retirement deductions. This $62 million is reflected on the valuation allowance line in the table above.

Deferred
income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. The components of the net
deferred income tax asset at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

At fiscal year end 2007, the Company had approximately $1,253 million of U.S. federal and $192 million of U.S state net operating
loss carryforwards (tax effected) which will expire in future years through 2027. In addition, at fiscal year end 2007, the Company had approximately $143 million of U.S. federal tax credit
carryforwards, of which $22 million have no expiration and $121 million will expire in future years through 2027, and $40 million of U.S. state tax credits carryforwards which
will expire in future years through 2027. The Company also had $5 million of U.S. federal contribution carryforwards (tax effected) expiring through 2011 and $21 million of U.S. federal
capital loss carryforwards (tax effected) expiring through 2010 at fiscal year end 2007.

At
fiscal year end 2007, the Company had approximately $466 million of net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected) in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, of which
$164 million have no expiration and $302 million will expire in future years through 2017. Also, at fiscal year end 2007, there were


$6 million
of non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards which will expire in future years through 2013 and $9 million of non-U.S. capital loss carryforwards (tax
effected) with no expiration.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $703 million and $611 million at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of
the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to
realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109,
"

Accounting for Income Taxes

," which requires that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a
portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. At fiscal year end 2007, approximately $4 million of the valuation allowance will ultimately reduce goodwill and approximately
$16 million of the valuation allocation will be recorded to equity if certain net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are utilized.

The
Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various regulatory tax authorities. See "Income Taxes" in Note 16 for further information.

The
calculation of the Company's tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across its global
operations. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities as well as related interest for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on its
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss
carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities.
The Company adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that
is materially different from the Company's current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of
these recorded amounts. If the Company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts
ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are
no longer necessary. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.

Except
for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or
for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the
investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if
the intention to permanently reinvest earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the
additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries.


19. Other Expense, Net

Other expense, net of $219 million in fiscal 2007 includes an allocation from Tyco International of $232 million for loss on retirement of debt. See
Note 12 for additional information. Additionally, in fiscal 2007, the Company recorded other income of $13 million associated with Tyco International's and Covidien's share of certain
contingent tax liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. For further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement, see Notes 16 and 17.

Other
expense, net in fiscal 2005 includes an allocation of $365 million from Tyco International for loss on retirement of debt. See Note 12 for additional information.

The
allocation methodology for the loss on retirement of debt is consistent with the treatment of debt and net interest expense as described in Note 12. Management believes that
this allocation was reasonable given the impact such retirements had on the overall capital structure of Tyco International. However, these amounts may not be indicative of the actual losses on the
retirement of debt that the Company would have incurred had the Company been operating as a separate, stand-alone company for the periods presented.

20. (Loss) Earnings Per Share

The computation of basic (loss) earnings per share is based on the Company's net (loss) income divided by the basic weighted-average number of common shares. On
June 29, 2007, the Separation from Tyco International was completed in a tax-free distribution to the Company's shareholders of one common share of Tyco Electronics Ltd. for
every four common shares of Tyco International held on June 18, 2007. As a result, on June 29, 2007, the Company had 497 million common
shares outstanding. The same number of shares is being used for both diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share for all periods prior to the date of Separation as no Tyco Electronics
equity awards were outstanding prior to the Separation.

The
following table sets forth the denominators of the basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share computations:

Fiscal




(in millions)

Diluted




For the year ended September 28, 2007, options to purchase Tyco Electronics' common shares with the underlying exercise prices less than
the average market prices were outstanding, but were excluded from the calculations of diluted loss per share, as inclusion of these securities would have been antidilutive. Such shares not included
in the computation of diluted loss per share totaled 3 million as of September 28, 2007.


In addition, certain share option awards were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for the year ended September 28, 2007 because the
instruments' underlying exercise prices were greater than the average market prices of Tyco Electronics' common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive. Such shares not included in the computation
of diluted loss per share totaled 20 million as of September 28, 2007.

The
Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into pursuant to Separation requires that the Company issue common shares, as needed, to satisfy convertible debentures issued prior to
Separation by Tyco International and retained by Tyco International subsequent to Separation. Up to approximately 250,000 shares could be issued to satisfy convertible debentures. For the year ended
September 28, 2007, the number of shares issuable to holders of unconverted Tyco International debt would be antidilutive. Such shares not included in the computation of diluted loss per share
were insignificant as of September 28, 2007.

21. Equity

Parent Company Investment

For all periods prior to June 29, 2007, Tyco International's investment in the electronics businesses is shown as parent company investment in the Combined
Financial Statements. Parent company investment represents the historical investment of capital into the Company, the Company's accumulated net earnings after taxes, and the net effect of transactions
with and allocations from Tyco International. See Note 17 for additional information regarding the allocation to the Company of various expenses incurred by Tyco International.

On
June 29, 2007, Tyco International completed a distribution of one common share of Tyco Electronics Ltd. for every four common shares of Tyco International. Following the
Separation, the Company had 497 million common shares outstanding. After the Separation adjustments were recorded on June 29, 2007, the remaining parent company investment balance, which
includes all earnings prior to the Separation, was transferred to contributed surplus. Net income subsequent to the Separation is included in accumulated earnings.

Preferred Shares

The Company has authorized 125,000,000 preferred shares, par value of $0.20 per share, none of which were issued and outstanding at September 28, 2007.
Rights as to dividends, return of capital, redemption, conversion, voting, and otherwise with respect to the preferred shares may be determined


by
the Company's board of directors on or before the time of issuance. In the event of the liquidation of the Company, the holders of any preferred shares then outstanding would be entitled to payment
to them of the amount for which the preferred shares were subscribed and any unpaid dividends prior to any payment to the common shareholders.

Dividends

In September 2007, the Company's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per common share to be paid on November 1,
2007. The declared but unpaid dividend is recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fiscal year end 2007.

Share Repurchase Program

In September 2007, the Company's board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of $750 million to purchase a portion of the Company's
outstanding common shares. No common shares were repurchased under this program in fiscal 2007.

translation adjustments and included in net income as a result of the sale of non-U.S. entities. The $30 million gain in fiscal 2005 related to the Tyco Global Network and is
included in gain on divestiture in the Combined Statement of Operations.


23. Share Plans

Prior to Separation on June 29, 2007, all equity awards (restricted share awards and share options) held by Company employees were granted under the Tyco
International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan or other Tyco International equity incentive plans. All equity awards granted by the Company subsequent to Separation were granted under the
Tyco Electronics Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan is administered by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Tyco
Electronics, which consists exclusively of independent directors of Tyco Electronics and provides for the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses,
long-term performance awards, restricted units, deferred stock units, restricted stock, promissory stock, and other stock-based awards (collectively, "Awards"). The 2007 Plan provides for
a maximum of 25 million common shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan allows for the use of authorized but unissued
shares or treasury shares to be used to satisfy such awards.

Prior
to the Separation, all employee equity awards were granted by Tyco International. At the time of Separation, significantly all of Tyco International's outstanding restricted share
awards issued to Company employees prior to September 29, 2006 were converted into restricted share awards of the Company at a ratio of one share of the Company for every four Tyco
International common shares. The conversion of those pre-September 29, 2006 awards also resulted in the issuance of one restricted share award in Tyco International and Covidien.
The conversion of pre-September 29, 2006 awards to executives and employees of Tyco International and Covidien resulted in the issuance of a Tyco Electronics Ltd. restricted
share award for every four Tyco International awards that existed. The remaining restricted share and share option awards issued to Company employees converted into restricted share and share option
awards of the Company based on a ratio of the Company's final pre-Separation when-issued share price and Tyco International's pre-Separation closing share price.
All share option awards granted prior to September 29, 2006 to Company employees who were identified as "Tyco Corporate Employees' prior to Separation converted to share option awards in each
of the three post-Separation companies based on ratios of the respective company's final pre-Separation when-issued share price and Tyco International's
pre-Separation closing share price. All share option award conversions were done in accordance with Sections 409A and 424 of the Code. Upon Separation, all performance conditions on
outstanding performance share awards to Company employees were lifted and those awards converted to restricted share awards in the Company's stock only.

Restricted Share Awards

Restricted share awards are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2007 Plan. All
restrictions on the award will lapse upon retirement or normal retirement eligibility, death, or disability of the employee. Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and
receive dividends, whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents. For grants which vest based on certain specified performance criteria, the fair market
value of the shares or units is expensed over the period of performance, once achievement of criteria is deemed probable. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair market value of the
award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the
grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest in one-third increments over a period of four years beginning in the second year, as determined by the Management Development and
Compensation Committee, or upon attainment of various levels of performance that


equal
or exceed targeted levels, if applicable. The compensation expense recognized for restricted share awards is net of estimated forfeitures.

A
summary of the status of restricted share awards and performance share grants by Tyco International prior to Separation and Tyco Electronics subsequent to Separation as of fiscal year
end 2007 and changes during the year then ended is presented below:

Included in the Awards granted pursuant to Separation above are 1,337,767 restricted share awards granted to employees and executives of Tyco
International and Covidien. Fifty percent of those awards vested on July 2, 2007 and the remaining fifty percent will vest on January 2, 2008. Any expense related to this accelerated
vesting is borne by the company employing the individual to whom the grant was awarded, either Tyco International or Covidien.

Fifty
percent of the expense associated with issuance of Tyco International and Covidien restricted share awards made to employees of the Company as a result of the Separation was
recorded by the Company on July 2, 2007 and the remaining fifty percent is being expensed ratably through January 2, 2008. This acceleration of expense for Company employees is borne by
the Company and is included in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations within separation costs.

The
weighted-average grant-date fair value of Tyco International restricted share awards granted to Tyco Electronics employees during pre-Separation fiscal 2007,
2006 and 2005 was $30.34, $28.96, and $35.52 respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of Tyco Electronics restricted share awards granted during fiscal 2007 was $39.69. The
total fair value of restricted share awards vested for grants made by Tyco International to Tyco Electronics employees was $19 million during pre-Separation fiscal 2007,
$5 million during fiscal 2006, and less than $1 million during fiscal 2005. The total fair


value
of restricted share awards vested for grants made by Tyco Electronics was $25 million during fiscal 2007.

The total fair value of Tyco International performance shares granted to Tyco Electronics employees vested during pre-Separation
fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 was insignificant. Tyco Electronics issued no performance shares during fiscal 2007.

As
of fiscal year end 2007, there was $89 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to both non-vested Tyco Electronics restricted share awards and
performance shares. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 fiscal years.

Deferred Stock Units

Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs") are notional units that are tied to the value of Tyco Electronics common shares with distribution deferred until termination of
employment. Distribution, when made, will be in the form of actual shares. Similar to restricted share grants that vest through the passage of time, the fair value of DSUs is determined based on the
market value of the Company's shares on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the vesting period. Recipients of DSUs do not have the right to vote such shares and do not have the right to
receive cash dividends. However, they have the right to receive dividend equivalents, which are delivered at the same time as the underlying DSUs. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of
grant. During fiscal year 2007, the Company granted 44,450 DSUs that vested immediately. The grant date fair value of those grants was expensed immediately and was determined to be insignificant.

Share Options

Share options (or Options) are granted to purchase Tyco Electronics common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of the common
shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2007 Plan. Options generally vest and become exercisable in equal annual installments over
a period of four years and will generally expire 10 years after the date of grant.

As
a result of the Separation, 7,217,640 share option awards were issued to employees and executives of Tyco International and Covidien. Share option activity for grants by Tyco
International

The conversion of Tyco International share option awards into Tyco Electronics share option awards at Separation was considered a modification of
an award in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, "

Share Based Payment

." As a result, the Company compared the fair value of the award immediately prior
to the Separation to the fair value immediately after the Separation to measure incremental compensation cost. The conversion resulted in an increase in the fair value of the awards of
$13 million. Of that amount, the Company recorded non-cash compensation expense of $11 million in separation costs in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations
for fiscal year 2007. The remaining $2 million of modification expense will be recorded through 2011.

As
of fiscal year end 2007, there was $58 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested Tyco Electronics share options granted under Tyco
Electronics share option plans. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective October 1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. As a result, the
Company's results from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 include incremental share-based compensation expense of $40 million. Total share-based compensation cost during fiscal 2007, 2006,
and 2005 of $100 million, $69 million, and $20 million, respectively, has been included in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations within selling, general, and
administrative expenses and separation costs. The Company has recognized a


related
tax benefit associated with its share-based compensation arrangements of $27 million, $19 million, and $6 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Prior
to October 1, 2005, the Company accounted for share-based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, as
permitted by SFAS No. 123, and accordingly did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the stock at
the date of grant. If Tyco International and the Company applied the fair value based method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, for share options granted by Tyco International to Tyco Electronics
employees, the effect on net income would have been as follows:

The grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then
amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain
assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected stock price volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the stock of a composite of peers of Tyco Electronics and
implied volatility derived from exchange traded options on that same composite of peers. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and
post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected
life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share was based on Tyco Electronics' expected dividend rate. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures.
Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.


The

The weighted-average grant-date fair values of Tyco International options granted to Tyco Electronics employees during
pre-Separation fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $9.52, $8.96, and $10.97, respectively. The total intrinsic value of Tyco International options exercised by Tyco Electronics employees
during pre-Separation fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $48 million, $22 million, and $32 million, respectively.

The
weighted-average grant-date fair value of Tyco Electronics options granted during post-Separation fiscal 2007 was $12.34. The total intrinsic value of Tyco
Electronics options exercised during post-Separation fiscal 2007 was $7 million. The total cash received by the Company related to the exercise of options totaled
$14 million. The related excess cash tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for fiscal 2007 in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows was not significant.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

The Company has adopted the Tyco Electronics Ltd. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESP Plan"). Substantially all full-time employees of the
Company's U.S. subsidiaries and employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in this employee share purchase plan. Eligible employees authorize
payroll deductions to be made for the purchase of shares. The Company matches a portion of the employee contribution by contributing an additional 15% of the employee's payroll deduction on the first
$40,000 of payroll deductions. All shares purchased under the ESP Plan are purchased on the open market by a designated broker. The Company expects to allow participation in the ESP Plan during the
first quarter of fiscal 2008.


Tyco
Electronics also maintains two other employee stock purchase plans for the benefit of employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries. The terms of these plans
provided employees the right to purchase shares of the Company's stock at a stated price and receive certain tax benefits.

The
Company has adopted the Tyco Electronics Ltd. Savings Related Share Plan (the "UK SAYE Plan"). Under the UK SAYE Plan, eligible employees in the United Kingdom are granted
options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at 85% of the market price at the time of grant. Options under the UK SAYE Plan are generally exercisable after a period of three years
and expire six months after the date of vesting. The Company expects to allow participation in the UK SAYE Plan during the second quarter of fiscal 2008.

The
Company also has adopted the Tyco Electronics Ireland Limited Irish Revenue Approved Profit Sharing Plan (the "Irish Bonus Plan"). Under the Irish Bonus Plan, eligible employees are
offered the opportunity to acquire shares using a portion of their bonus. Such employees also have the opportunity to forego a portion of their basic salary to purchase additional shares. The Company
expects to allow participation in the Irish Bonus Plan during the second quarter of fiscal 2008.

24. Consolidated and Combined Segment and Geographic Data

The Company aggregates its operating segments into four reportable segments based upon the Company's internal business structure. See Note 1 for a
description of the segments in which the Company operates. Segment performance is evaluated based on net sales and operating income. Generally, the Company considers all expenses to be of an operating
nature, and, accordingly, allocates them to each reportable segment. Costs specific to a segment are charged to the segment. Corporate expenses, such as headquarters administrative costs, are
allocated to the segments based on segment income from operations. Allocated class action settlement costs, net and separation costs incurred in fiscal 2007 were not allocated to the segments.
Intersegment sales are not material and are recorded at selling prices that approximate market prices.

Net
sales and income from operations by business segment are presented in the following table for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005:

At
Separation, on June 29, 2007, the Company had 497 million common shares outstanding. The same number of shares is being used for both diluted earnings
per share and basic earnings per share for all periods prior to the date of Separation as no Tyco Electronics equity awards were outstanding prior to the Separation.

26. Subsequent Events

In October 2007, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Power Systems business for $100 million in cash, subject to a final
working capital adjustment. The Company expects to recognize a gain of approximately $40 million on this divestiture. The sale transaction is expected to close in the first or second quarter of
fiscal 2008.


27. Tyco Electronics Group S.A.

In December 2006, prior to the Separation, TEGSA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyco Electronics Ltd., was formed. TEGSA, a Luxembourg company, is a
holding company that owns directly, or indirectly, all of the operating subsidiaries of Tyco Electronics Ltd. TEGSA is the borrower under the Company's revolving credit facility, as well as
obligor under the Company's senior notes issued in September 2007 and bridge loan facility, all of which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, Tyco Electronics Ltd. The
following tables present condensed consolidating financial information for Tyco Electronics Ltd., TEGSA and all other subsidiaries that are not providing a guarantee of debt but which represent
assets of TEGSA, using the equity method.
