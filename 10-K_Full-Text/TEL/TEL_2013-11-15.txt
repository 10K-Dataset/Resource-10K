Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:

•

Portfolio of market-leading connectivity businesses.

We
are a leader in many of the markets we serve, and the opportunity for growth in those markets is significant. We believe our four segments serve a combined market of approximately $100 billion
that is expected to grow at an estimated annual growth rate of approximately 5% over the next five years.

•

Global leader in passive components.

With net sales of
$13.3 billion in fiscal 2013, we are significantly larger than many of our competitors. In the fragmented connector industry, which we estimated to be approximately $50 billion in fiscal
2013, our net sales were approximately $8.5 billion. We have established a global leadership position in the connector industry with leading market positions in the following markets:
automotive—#1, industrial—#1, telecom/data communications—#2, and consumer electronics—#2.

Our
scale provides us the opportunity to accelerate our sales growth by making larger investments in existing and new technologies and businesses in our core markets, and to expand

many years. We believe that this diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduces our exposure to individual end markets, thereby
reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our
competitors.

•

Global presence.

We have an established manufacturing
presence in over 20 countries and global sales distribution. Our global coverage positions us near our customers' locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering
their production costs. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile.

•

Strong management team and employee base.

We believe our
management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our Chief Executive Officer and segment leaders average more than
20 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry.

We
have approximately 84,000 employees located throughout the world. We continue to emphasize employee development and training, and we embrace diversity and inclusion. Our strong employee base, along
with their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company's success.

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing
technological innovations, and
licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an
effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.

We
own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents
and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent
protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.

While
we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by
any single patent or group of related patents.

Employees

As of September 27, 2013, we employed approximately 84,000 people worldwide, of whom 27,000 were in the Americas region, 27,000
were in the Europe/Middle East/Africa region, and 30,000 were in the Asia–Pacific region. Of our total employees, approximately 49,000 were employed in manufacturing.

Government Regulation and Supervision

The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the United States ("U.S.") and other countries. A small portion of our
products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance
organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our
ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.

Environmental

Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge
of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials in products, chemical usage, and others. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our
employees and the environment. We maintain a global



environmental,
health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards, staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues, periodic compliance auditing, training, and
other measures. We have a program for compliance with the European Union ("EU") Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronics Equipment Directives, the China Restriction of
Hazardous Substances law, the EU REACH (chemical registration and evaluation) Regulation, and similar laws.

Compliance
with these laws has in the past and may in the future increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways. For example, laws regarding product content and chemical
registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase our costs for energy and certain materials and
products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon
our experience, current information, and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $12 million to $24 million. As of
September 27, 2013, we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately $13 million. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2014 for
environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.

Corporate History

Tyco Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd.
("Tyco International"). Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of our shares, as well as its shares of its former healthcare business, to its common shareholders (referred
to in this report as the "separation"). We became an independent, publicly traded company owning the former electronics businesses of Tyco International.

Our
business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions, from fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2002, of established electronics companies and divisions, including the acquisition
of AMP Incorporated and Raychem Corporation in fiscal 1999, and the Electromechanical Components Division of Siemens and OEM Division of Thomas & Betts in fiscal 2000. These companies each had
more than 50 years of history in engineering and innovation excellence. We operated as a segment of Tyco International prior to our separation.

Effective
June 25, 2009, we discontinued our existence as a Bermuda company and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law,
continued our existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of
association, and our Swiss organizational regulations.

In
March 2011, our shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of association to change our name from "Tyco Electronics Ltd." to "TE Connectivity Ltd." The name
change was effective March 10, 2011. Our ticker symbol "TEL" on the New York Stock Exchange remained unchanged.

We
acquired Deutsch Group SAS ("Deutsch") and ADC Telecommunications, Inc. ("ADC") in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information relating to these acquisitions.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks described
below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to risks that affect many other companies, such as general economic conditions, geopolitical events, competition, technological
obsolescence, labor relations, natural disasters, and international operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business
operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Risks Relating to Our Business

Conditions in global or regional economies, capital and money markets, and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally, including
the cost and availability of consumer and business credit, end demand from consumer and industrial markets, and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on
sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults, any of which could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow, and ability to obtain financing. As a
result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full. Further, our vendors
may experience similar problems, which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels. If regional or global economic conditions deteriorate, our results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Also, deterioration in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill
or other long-lived assets. Impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and financial position.

We are dependent on the automotive and other industries.

We are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products, and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and
reduced demand in these markets. Periodic downturns in our customers' industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations, financial position, and cash flows.



Approximately
41% of our net sales for fiscal 2013 were to customers in the automotive industry. The automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant
price pressure on their suppliers. Additionally, the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit
conditions. As a supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global
or regional economic and credit conditions and changes in the operations, products, business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automotive manufacturers, as
well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers.

During
fiscal 2013, our sales into the telecom networks; industrial; aerospace, defense, and marine; and consumer devices end markets accounted for 9%, 9%, 8%, and 8%, respectively, of
our net sales. The telecom networks industry has historically experienced fluctuations in demand resulting from changes in carrier activity and capital investments by customers. Demand for industrial
equipment is dependent upon economic conditions. The aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand, depending on worldwide economic and political conditions. The
consumer devices industry can experience variability in demand depending on the underlying business and consumer demand for computer and consumer electronics products, as well as the market share of
our customers.

We encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry.

We operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components, and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase
in the future. Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price, quality, and performance of our products, the level of customer service, the development of new
technology, our ability to participate in emerging markets, and customers' expectations relating to socially responsible operations. The competition we
experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large, diversified manufacturers to small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has become
increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years, and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us
primarily on price, and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products. We cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our markets, or that we will be able to
compete successfully against existing or new competitors. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely
affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue.

Substantially all of the markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences,
which are rapid in certain end markets. Our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design, develop, introduce, and sell new and innovative products, to modify existing
products, and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change. There are numerous risks inherent in these processes, including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate
the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands.

Like other suppliers to the electronics industry, we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices.

We have historically experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, continuing pressure to lower our prices. In recent years, we
have experienced price erosion of approximately 1% each year. In



order
to maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot assure you that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on
our margins, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.

We are a large buyer of resin, copper, gold, silver, brass, steel, chemicals and additives, zinc, and other precious metals. Many of
these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, the price of many of these raw materials,
including gold and copper, has increased in recent years and continues to fluctuate. In recent years, we have only been able to partially offset these increases through higher selling prices. Our
results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials
deteriorates, or there are continued significant price increases for these raw materials. Any of these events could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and, to the extent
we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers, our margins may decline, materially affecting our results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows. In addition, we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices. The success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned
consumption of the hedged commodity materials. We could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate.

The
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the
conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo ("DRC"). As a result, the SEC established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use "conflict" minerals mined from the
DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These requirements were effective for the calendar year beginning January 1, 2013. These requirements could affect the sourcing, pricing, and
availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that
we will be able to obtain these metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other
stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we are implementing.

Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and
revenue. Approximately 53% of our net sales for fiscal 2013 were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, and we expect non-U.S. Dollar revenue to represent a significant and likely
increased portion of our future net revenue. Therefore, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the Euro or Asian
currencies, our U.S. Dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. Changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial position, and
cash flows. We manage this risk in part by entering into financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by the counterparty to these contracts, our efforts to manage these
risks might not be successful.

We may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate.

Many of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become more
concentrated in recent years, including the automotive, telecommunications, computer, and aerospace and defense industries. Consolidation of customers may



lead
to decreased product purchases from us. In addition, as our customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find
alternative sources from which to purchase. Our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends may adversely affect the profit margins on our
products, particularly for commodity components.

The life cycles of our products can be very short.

The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle. As a result, the resources devoted to
product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue, and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering
expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover, and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our results of operations, financial position, and cash
flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Future acquisitions may not be successful.

We regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses, product lines, or technologies which have the potential to
strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings. We cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future. We
also cannot assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be
successfully integrated with our existing business, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity.

If we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash, the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks,
public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other
leverage measures. We cannot assure you that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to make an acquisition partially or wholly
funded by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares.

Our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain executive management employees and limitations affecting retention and hiring, including
new Swiss regulations, could have a negative impact on our business and increase our expenses.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our executive management employees and hire new
executive management employees to replace, succeed, or add to members of our executive management team. Our executive management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to
replace. Competition for executive talent is intense, and we compete for these personnel with other companies that are regulated by the laws of jurisdictions that provide significantly greater
flexibility than Switzerland, our jurisdiction of incorporation, in compensation practices for executive management employees. As a Swiss company, we are and will be subject to limitations on
compensation practices for our current and future executive management employees under a recently passed Swiss constitutional amendment (the Minder initiative) and its proposed regulations (the "New
Swiss Regulations") which come into effect on and after January 1, 2014. The New Swiss Regulations, among other things, will require an annual binding say-on-pay vote by shareholders for the
compensation of our executive management employees and board of directors; prohibit most forms of severance payments, advance payments, and payments provided in connection with a change of control of
the company or an acquired or divested business unit; require that many



aspects
of the compensation practices for our executive management employees and board of directors be included in our articles of association and subject to the approval of shareholders when
initially implemented and when changed in the future; and subject our management and board of directors to
criminal sanctions relating to actions taken in connection with certain compensation practices. The New Swiss Regulations' restrictions on compensation practices generally are not representative of
the regulatory environment applicable to most non-Swiss companies, and the applicability of the New Swiss Regulations to us could make it more difficult for us to retain and compete on a global basis
for certain members of our executive management team who report to our chief executive officer. The loss of the services of one or more of our key executive management employees or our difficulty in
hiring new executive management employees could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, the development of compensation practices complying in all respects with the New Swiss Regulations,
as well as the search for new executive management personnel in the future, could divert management's time and attention and result in increased expenses to us. Furthermore, we are subject to the
Exchange Act and its proxy rules, which provide for a non-binding say-on-pay vote by our shareholders for compensation of our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and three other most
highly compensated executive officers and other disclosures relating to our executive compensation. The regulatory scheme under the New Swiss Regulations for executive compensation is not consistent
with the SEC's regulatory scheme, and the two conflicting bodies of executive compensation regulations applicable to us could lead to confusing and inconsistent proposals to our shareholders for
approval at annual general meetings and inconsistencies in executive compensation disclosure in related proxy statements and our other SEC disclosure documents.

We could suffer significant business interruptions.

Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers, and the supply chains that supports their operations, may be vulnerable to
interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, or floods, or other disasters such as fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war, disease, or failures of management
information or other systems due to internal or external causes. If a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events, our
business, financial position, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

We may use components and products manufactured by third parties.

We may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to
manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality
control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. If these third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and components on time and at reasonable prices,
we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged.

Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology.

The electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry,
companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or
invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the importance of the technology, product, patent,
trademark, or trade secret in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.



A decline in the market value of our pension plans' investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could adversely affect our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

Concerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with concerns about credit, inflation, or deflation, have caused and could
continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities, including fixed income and equity securities, which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans'
investment portfolios. In addition, the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved. A decrease in the value of our pension plans' investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan
assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding.

The global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted, which has reduced the availability of
investment capital and credit. Recent downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital. As a result, we may be unable to access adequate funding
to operate and grow our business. Our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures. The
extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity
markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity, the cost of financing, and other general economic and business conditions.

Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures. Any
divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial position. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from
other business concerns, the disruption of our business, and the potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant
risks encountered.

If any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations, our business may suffer.

Our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in
particular the U.S. and the EU. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electrical
components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We also may be subject to third-party claims for damages. Further, agreements
that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce our
commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, any failure to maintain compliance with
trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction, which could negatively impact our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.



We are subject to global risks of political, economic, and military instability.

Our workforce; manufacturing, research, administrative, and sales facilities; markets; customers; and suppliers are located throughout
the world. As a result, we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including:

•

tariffs, trade barriers, and trade disputes;

•

regulations related to customs and import/export matters;

•

variations in lengths of payment cycles;

•

tax issues, such as tax law changes, examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country,
and difficulties in the tax-efficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions;

•

challenges in collecting accounts receivable;

•

employment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost
regions in which we currently operate;

•

difficulties protecting intellectual property;

•

instability in economic or political conditions, including sovereign debt levels, Eurozone uncertainty, inflation,
recession, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts; and

•

the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements.

We
have sizeable operations in China, including 16 manufacturing sites. In addition, approximately 15% of our net sales in fiscal 2013 were made to customers in China. The legal system
in China is still developing and is subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders for products in China could be adversely affected by changes to or interpretation of Chinese law.

In
addition, any downgrade by rating agencies of long-term U.S. sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets
and economic conditions, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and liquidity.

We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies
and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We
operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs
and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by
our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, and violations.

We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various
countries where we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials;



•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment;

•

investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites;

•

greenhouse gas emissions;

•

product hazardous material content; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

We
may not have been, or we may not at all times be, in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, or
otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or
materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigative, removal, and remedial costs under certain federal and state laws are
retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or
exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerly-owned sites
where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs
of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites.

While
we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future
environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect
our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present,
or future business activities.

Our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, and recycling.

The EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing
environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other
related matters. These laws include the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances, End of Life Vehicle, and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the EU REACH (chemical registration and
evaluation) Regulation, the China law on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution by Electronic Information Products, and various other laws. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in
the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters.
These laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These laws could make manufacture or
sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions.



We are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and
cash flows.

In the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual
property rights, anti-competitive behavior, product liability, breach of contract, and employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful
plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be
required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position,
and cash flows.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our bank credit facility contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt (as defined in the credit
facility) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (as defined in the credit facility) and limits on the amount of subsidiary
debt and incurrence of liens. Our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability to consolidate,
merge, and sell assets.

Although
none of these covenants is presently restrictive to our operations, our continued ability to meet the bank credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond
our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures. Upon
the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our
lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our bank credit facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will
have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration of
any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder.

The
indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available or access to
funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change
of control triggering event.

Risks Relating to Our Separation from Tyco International

We share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date.

In connection with our separation from Tyco International in 2007, we, Tyco International, and its former healthcare businesses
("Covidien") entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, under which we share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for
periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. We, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax
authorities to our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to
intercompany transactions or similar adjustments, and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in



anticipation
of the separation. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. We are responsible for all of our own taxes
that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax
Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

All
of the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses, including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from Tyco International, became our tax liabilities. Although
we have agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco
International and Covidien default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for
all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and
required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's
tax liabilities.

Our,
Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. We are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. See additional information in "Income
Tax Matters" in "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings." Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that we have assessed under the uncertain
tax position provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740,

Income Taxes

, have been reflected as liabilities on the Consolidated Financial
Statements. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our
operations. We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and
related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards. These estimates may change due to changing facts and
circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International has the right to administer, control, and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.
The timing, nature, and amount of any settlement agreed to by Tyco International may not be in our best interests. Moreover, the other parties to the Tax Sharing Agreement will be able to remove Tyco
International as the controlling party only under limited circumstances, including a change of control or bankruptcy of Tyco International, or by a majority vote of the parties. All other tax audits
will be administered, controlled, and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax.

If the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could
incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

Tyco International received private letter rulings from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution
of our common shares and Covidien common shares to the Tyco International shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution, except for cash received in



lieu
of a fractional share of our common shares and the Covidien common shares, will qualify as tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). The
private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. In addition to obtaining the
private letter rulings, Tyco International obtained opinions from outside legal counsel confirming the tax-free status of the distribution and certain internal transactions. The private letter rulings
and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings, from us, Tyco International, and Covidien regarding the past and future conduct of our
respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be
treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distributions should be
taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution. If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, Tyco
International would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares and Covidien common shares distributed to Tyco International shareholders on the
distribution date over Tyco International's tax basis in such common shares, but such gain, if recognized, generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, we would incur
significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation should be treated as taxable
transactions.

In
addition, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable and such determination was the result
of actions taken after the distribution by us, Tyco International, or Covidien, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us, Tyco International, or Covidien
as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us, Tyco International, or Covidien, then we, Tyco International, or Covidien would be
responsible for 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on us, Tyco International, or Covidien as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. In the event that
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be responsible
for an equal amount of the defaulting party's obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other party's taxes.

Risks Relating to Our Swiss Jurisdiction of Incorporation

Legislative and other proposals in Switzerland, the U.S., and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate.

Various U.S. and non-U.S. legislative proposals and other initiatives have been directed at companies incorporated in lower-tax
jurisdictions. We believe that recently there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and other initiatives as various jurisdictions look for solutions to fiscal deficits. If
adopted, these proposed changes could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives, and we cannot
assure you that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us.

Legislation in the U.S. could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our
business by denying government contracts to U.S. companies that have moved to lower-tax jurisdictions.



We
expect the U.S. Congress to continue to consider implementation and/or expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that
have corporate locations abroad. We believe that we are less likely to be subject to such proposals since becoming a Swiss corporation in June 2009. However, we cannot predict the likelihood that, or
final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, the effect such enactments and increased
regulatory scrutiny may have on our business, or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Therefore, we cannot assure you that any such legislative action will not apply to us. In addition,
we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of our
non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot assure you that
the impact will not be materially adverse to us.

As a Swiss corporation, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares.

As a Swiss corporation, our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves
on our standalone unconsolidated Swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements. Our articles of association allow us to create authorized share
capital that can be issued by the board of directors, but this authorization is limited to (i) authorized share capital up to 50% of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid
for a maximum of two years, which authorization period ends on March 6, 2015, and (ii) conditional share capital of up to 50% of the existing registered shares that may be issued only
for specific purposes. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital
and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital. Swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms
that can attach to different classes of shares, and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions, including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to
liquidation, dividends, and/or voting. Moreover, under Swiss law, we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par
value of our registered shares. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders,
which would delay the timing to execute such actions. Such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management. While we do not believe that Swiss law
requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us, we cannot assure you that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial
benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors.

Swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in
Switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland would recognize or
enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or
those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some



remedies
available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as they are contrary to that nation's public policy.

Swiss
corporate law, which applies to us, differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the
manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification
available to directors and officers. Thus, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a
jurisdiction of the U.S.

Risks Relating to Our Shares

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely.

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors,
including:

•

our quarterly or annual earnings;

•

changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide;

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global economic conditions and investors' concerns about
potential risks to future economic growth;

•

changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;

•

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; and

•

the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our
business.

We might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.

In order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of Swiss withholding tax, we anticipate making distributions to
shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) or registered share capital. Various tax law and corporate law proposals in Switzerland, if
passed in the future, may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal
requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) or through a reduction of registered share
capital, or that Swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future. In addition, over the long term, the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited. Our
ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is
important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Currency fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Swiss Franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders
to Swiss withholding tax.

Under Swiss corporate law, we are required to state our year end unconsolidated Swiss statutory financial statements in Swiss Francs.
Although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in U.S. Dollars, shareholder



resolutions
with respect to such distributions are required to be stated in Swiss Francs. If the U.S. Dollar were to increase in value relative to the Swiss Franc, the U.S. Dollar amount of registered
share capital available for future distributions without Swiss withholding tax will decrease.

We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares.

The Swiss Code of Obligations regulates a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only
repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. The aggregate par value
of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, only if
our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased
shares are dedicated for cancellation. Additionally, various tax law and corporate law proposals in Switzerland, if passed in the future, may affect our ability to repurchase our shares. Our ability
to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to
repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings.

Our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by Swiss law for Swiss companies like us that
issue registered shares (as opposed to bearer shares). This provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights, holders of our shares must be registered in our share register (Aktienbuch) as
shareholders with voting rights. Only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders' meetings, but all
shareholders will be entitled to dividends, distributions, preemptive rights, advance subscription rights, and liquidation proceeds. The board of directors may, in its discretion, refuse to register
shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association. Additionally, various proposals in Switzerland for
corporate law changes, if passed in the future, may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and
banks. Such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders
might consider favorable.

Our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered "anti-takeover" provisions because they would make it harder
for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions, among others:

•

shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent, and

•

restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15% or more of
our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors.

These
provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of our issued voting shares, which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or
delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price, or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders. Our articles of association also
contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital



(in
either case, representing a maximum of 50% of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in the case of issuances from authorized capital, until March 6, 2015 unless
re-authorized by shareholders for a subsequent two-year period) without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders' preemptive rights or advance subscription rights, for the purpose of
the defense of an actual, threatened, or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in relation to which the board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial advisor, has not recommended
acceptance to the shareholders. We note that Swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under Swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive
rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital. In addition, the New York Stock Exchange, on which our shares are listed,
requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20% or more of the outstanding shares or voting power, with limited exceptions.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Properties

Our principal offices in the U.S. are located in Berwyn, Pennsylvania in a facility that we rent. We operate approximately 90
manufacturing, warehousing, and office locations in over 20 states in the U.S. We also operate nearly 300 manufacturing, warehousing, and office locations in over 50 countries and territories outside
the U.S.

We
own approximately 20 million square feet of space and lease approximately 11 million square feet of space. Our facilities are reasonably maintained and suitable for the
operations conducted in them.

Manufacturing

We manufacture our products in over 20 countries worldwide. Our manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of the manufacturing
processes, including our primary processes of stamping, plating, molding, extrusion, beaming, and assembly. We expect to continue to migrate our manufacturing activities to lower-cost countries as our
customers' requirements shift. In addition, we will continue to look for efficiencies to reduce our manufacturing costs and believe that we can achieve cost reductions through improved manufacturing
efficiency and migration of manufacturing to lower-cost countries.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including product liability matters,
employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and
use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. In addition, we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the ordinary course of business, we are involved
as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third party's patent were to be determined against us, we might be required to make significant
royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to
be invalid or unenforceable, we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount.

At
September 27, 2013, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount
payable to the former



shareholders
of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the State of Florida in accordance with guidelines set forth in the
contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June
2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which is in the discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements as
we do not believe that any payment is probable at this time.

Management
believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these
proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position,
or cash flows. However, the proceedings discussed below in "Income Tax Matters" could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Income Tax Matters

During fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the
years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue Agent Reports that reflected the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud
penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. The penalties were asserted against
a prior subsidiary of Tyco International that was distributed to us in connection with the separation. Tyco International appealed certain of the proposed adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000,
and Tyco International resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments, including reaching an agreement with the IRS on the penalty adjustment in the amount of
$21 million. In October 2012, the IRS issued special agreement Forms 870-AD, effectively settling its audit of all tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000, excluding one issue that
remains in dispute as described below. As a result of these developments, in fiscal 2013, we recognized an income tax benefit of $331 million and other expense of $231 million pursuant
to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien.

The
disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. The IRS field examination asserted that certain intercompany loans originating during the period
1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately $2.7 billion of related interest deductions recognized during the period on Tyco
International's U.S. income tax returns. In addition, if the IRS is ultimately successful in asserting its claim, it is likely to disallow an additional $6.6 billion of interest deductions
reflected on U.S. income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000. Tyco International contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt for U.S. tax purposes and that the interest
deductions reflected on the income tax returns are appropriate. The IRS and Tyco International were unable to resolve this matter through the IRS appeals process. On June 20, 2013, Tyco
International advised us that it had received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS for certain former U.S. subsidiaries of Tyco International increasing taxable income by approximately
$2.9 billion in connection with the audit of Tyco International's fiscal years 1997 through 2000. The Notices of Deficiency assert that Tyco International owes additional taxes totaling
$778 million, associated penalties of $154 million, and withholding taxes of $105 million. In addition, Tyco International received Final Partnership Administrative Adjustments
for certain U.S. partnerships owned by former U.S. subsidiaries with respect to which Tyco International estimates an additional tax deficiency of approximately $30 million will be asserted.
The amounts asserted by the IRS exclude any applicable deficiency interest, and do not reflect any impact to subsequent period tax liabilities in the event that the IRS were to prevail on some or all
of its assertions. We understand that Tyco International strongly disagrees with the IRS position and has filed petitions in the U.S. Tax Court



contesting
the IRS' proposed adjustments. Tyco International has advised us that it believes there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question and that the IRS positions with regard to
these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing Treasury regulations.

Resolution
of this matter in the U.S. Tax Court could take several years and no payments to the IRS with respect to these matters would be required until the matter is fully and finally
resolved. In accordance with the terms of a tax sharing agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien would share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of any payments made in connection with these
matters.

However,
as the ultimate outcome is uncertain and if the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, our share of the assessed tax, deficiency interest, and applicable withholding taxes and
penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We have reviewed the Notices of Deficiency, the relevant facts surrounding the
intercompany debt transactions, relevant tax regulations, and applicable case law, and we continue to believe that we are appropriately reserved for this matter.

requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant. We may from time to time enter into
financing agreements that contain financial covenants and restrictions, some of which may limit our ability to pay dividends or to distribute capital reductions.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans,
estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those
factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Our
Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. Dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").

Organic
net sales growth and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures which are discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, together with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information to investors because they reflect the financial measures that management uses in
evaluating the underlying results of our operations. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for more information about these non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including the measures
and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures.

Overview

We are a world leader in connectivity. We design and manufacture products to connect power, data, and signal in a broad array of
industries including automotive, energy, industrial, broadband communications, consumer devices, healthcare, and aerospace and defense. We help our customers solve the need for more energy efficiency,
always-on communications, and ever-increasing productivity.

Effective
for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we reorganized our management and segments to align the organization around our strategy. We now operate through four reporting segments:
Transportation Solutions, Network Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Consumer Solutions. See Notes 1 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our
segments. Prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current segment reporting structure.

Our
business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. Our sales are dependent on certain industry end markets that are impacted
by



consumer
as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be affected by changes in demand in those markets.

Overall,
our fiscal 2013 net sales and organic net sales were consistent with fiscal 2012 levels. On an organic basis, our sales into industrial- and infrastructure-based markets
declined, primarily as a result of weakness in the subsea communications and data communications end markets in the Network Solutions segment and the industrial end market in the Industrial Solutions
segment. Also, on an organic basis, our sales into consumer-based markets increased with growth in the automotive end market in the Transportation Solutions segment, partially offset by declines in
the consumer devices and appliances end markets in the Consumer Solutions segment.

Overall,
our net sales decreased 3.6% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. On an organic basis, net sales decreased 2.7% in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 levels. On an organic
basis, our sales into industrial- and infrastructure-based markets decreased, primarily as a result of weakness in the data communications, subsea communications, and telecom networks end markets in
the Network Solutions segment and the industrial end market in the Industrial Solutions segment. Our sales into consumer-based markets experienced modest growth, on an organic basis, as growth in the
automotive
end market in the Transportation Solutions segment was partially offset by declines in the appliances and consumer devices end markets in the Consumer Solutions segment.

The
acquisition of Deutsch in April 2012 benefited the automotive and aerospace, defense, and marine end markets in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments,
respectively, and contributed net sales of $327 million in fiscal 2012. Also, Deutsch contributed incremental net sales of $320 million in the first six months of fiscal 2013 over the
same period of fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed $267 million in net sales and $0.08 per share to diluted earnings per share. ADC, which was acquired in
December 2010, contributed net sales of $843 million, of which $24 million related to the additional week, during fiscal 2011. Also, the acquisition of ADC resulted in incremental net
sales of $154 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 over the same period of fiscal 2011.

The
March 2011 earthquake, subsequent tsunami, and aftershocks in Japan caused disruptions in our customers' operations and the supply chains that support their operations. We estimate
that our fiscal 2011 net sales and diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by $99 million and $0.07 per share, respectively, as a result of these disruptions. Our facilities in
Japan were not materially damaged, and we did not experience further negative impacts after 2011.

Outlook

We expect net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to be between $3.225 billion and $3.325 billion. This reflects
sales increases in the Transportation Solutions segment and, to a lesser degree, the Industrial Solutions segment, partially offset by sales decreases in the Consumer Solutions and Network Solutions
segments relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2013. In the Transportation Solutions segment, we expect our sales to increase approximately 10%, and we expect global automotive production to
increase 3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2013. In the Industrial Solutions segment, we expect our sales to increase approximately 10% in the industrial
end market with smaller increases in the aerospace, defense, and marine and energy end markets in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2013. In the Consumer
Solutions segment, we expect our sales to decline in the consumer devices end market, with this decline partially offset by a modest increase in our sales in the appliances end market in the first
quarter of fiscal 2014 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2013. In the Network Solutions segment, we expect our sales to decline during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, reflecting continued
weakness in the subsea communications and data communications end markets. We expect this decline



to
be partially offset by sales increases in the telecom networks end market. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.75 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.

For
fiscal 2014, we expect net sales to be between $13.65 billion and $14.15 billion, reflecting expected sales increases in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial
Solutions segments and, to a lesser degree, the Consumer Solutions segment from fiscal 2013 levels. In the Transportation Solutions segment, we expect our sales growth to exceed an anticipated
increase in global automotive production of approximately 4% from fiscal 2013 levels. In the Industrial Solutions segment, we expect our sales to increase in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 levels in all
end markets, with growth primarily in the aerospace, defense, and marine end market due to strength in commercial aviation and oil and gas markets. In the Consumer Solutions segment, we expect a
slight increase in our sales in the appliances end market in fiscal 2014 while our sales in the consumer devices end market are expected to be consistent with fiscal 2013 levels. In the Network
Solutions segment, we expect our fiscal 2014 sales to be consistent with fiscal 2013 levels, with increased sales in the telecom networks end market offset by decreased sales in the data
communications end market. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.41 to $3.71 per share in fiscal 2014.

The
above outlook is based on foreign exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.

We
are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. Additionally, we continue to closely manage our costs in
line with economic conditions. We also are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. (See further
discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources.")

Acquisitions

On April 3, 2012, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Deutsch. The total value paid for the transaction amounted to
€1.55 billion (approximately $2.05 billion using an exchange rate of $1.33 per €1.00), net of cash acquired. The total value paid included
$659 million related to the repayment of Deutsch's financial debt and accrued interest. The acquired Deutsch businesses have been reported in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial
Solutions segments from the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2012, Deutsch contributed net sales of $327 million and an operating loss of $54 million to our Consolidated Statement of
Operations. The operating loss included charges of $75 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and
customer order
backlog, acquisition costs of $21 million, restructuring charges of $14 million, and integration costs of $6 million.

In
July 2010, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire 100% of the outstanding stock of ADC, a provider of broadband communications network connectivity products and
related solutions. On December 9, 2010, upon effecting a short-form merger under Minnesota law, we owned 100% of the outstanding shares of ADC for a total purchase price of approximately
$1,263 million in cash (excluding cash acquired of $546 million) and $22 million representing the fair value of ADC share-based awards exchanged for TE Connectivity share options
and stock appreciation rights. The acquired ADC businesses have been included in the Network Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2011, ADC contributed net sales of
$843 million and an operating loss of $53 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The operating loss included restructuring charges of $80 million, charges of
$39 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, integration costs of
$10 million, and acquisition costs of $9 million.

See
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.



Restructuring

We plan to continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint by migrating facilities from higher-cost to lower-cost countries,
consolidating within countries, and transferring product lines to lower-cost countries. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating
leverage, and position us for growth in the years ahead. In connection with these initiatives and in response to market conditions, we incurred net restructuring charges of $314 million during
fiscal 2013 and expect to incur net restructuring charges of approximately $50 million during fiscal 2014. Cash spending related to restructuring was $151 million during fiscal 2013, and
we expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $175 million in fiscal 2014. Annualized cost savings related to these actions are expected to be
approximately $115 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2015. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative
expenses.

Discontinued Operations

During fiscal 2012, we sold our Touch Solutions business for net cash proceeds of $380 million and recognized an insignificant
pre-tax gain on the transaction. Also, during fiscal 2012, we sold our TE Professional Services business for net cash proceeds of $28 million and recognized an insignificant pre-tax gain on the
transaction. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Results of Operations

Key business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this report
include:

•

Raw material prices.

We purchased
approximately 172 million pounds of copper, 133,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.5 million troy ounces of silver in fiscal 2013. Prices continue to fluctuate. The following table sets
forth the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, and silver.

•

Foreign exchange.

Approximately
53% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value
of the U.S. Dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. Dollars at the end



of
each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2013 by major currencies invoiced was as follows:

Net Sales.

Net sales were $13,280 million and $13,282 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. On an organic
basis, net sales
decreased $171 million, or 1.3%, in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 as increased net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment were more than offset by decreases in the Network Solutions,
Industrial Solutions, and Consumer Solutions segments. Price erosion adversely affected organic sales by $207 million in fiscal 2013. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net
sales by $115 million, or 0.9%, in fiscal 2013. Deutsch, which was acquired on April 3, 2012, contributed incremental net sales of $320 million during the first six months of
fiscal 2013 over the same period of fiscal 2012.

Net
sales decreased $496 million, or 3.6%, to $13,282 million in fiscal 2012 from $13,778 million in fiscal 2011. On an organic basis, net sales decreased
$372 million, or 2.7%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of decreased net sales in the Network Solutions segment and, to a lesser degree, the Industrial Solutions and
Consumer Solutions segments. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by $338 million, or 2.4%, in fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed
$267 million in net sales. Deutsch contributed net sales of $327 million during fiscal 2012. Also, the acquisition of ADC on December 8, 2010 resulted in incremental net sales of
$154 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 over the same period of fiscal 2011.

Gross Margin.

In fiscal 2013, gross margin was $4,329 million, reflecting a $283 million increase from gross margin of
$4,046 million in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2012, gross margin included charges of $75 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily
related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog associated with Deutsch. Excluding this item, gross margin increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to improved
manufacturing productivity and, to a lesser degree, lower material costs, partially offset by price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.6% in fiscal 2013 from 30.5% in
fiscal 2012.



In
fiscal 2012, gross margin was $4,046 million, reflecting a $225 million decrease from gross margin of $4,271 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, gross margin
included charges of $75 million associated with the acquisition of Deutsch, whereas in fiscal 2011, gross margin included similar charges of $39 million associated with the acquisition
of ADC. Excluding these items, gross margin decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease resulted from lower sales levels and, to a lesser degree, increased material costs,
partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 30.5% in fiscal 2012 from 31.0% in fiscal 2011.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $88 million to
$1,773 million in
fiscal 2013 from $1,685 million in fiscal 2012. The increase resulted primarily from additional selling, general, and administrative expenses of Deutsch, increased incentive compensation costs,
and impairment charges on certain assets held for sale, partially offset by benefits attributable to restructuring actions. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales
increased to 13.4% in fiscal 2013 from 12.7% in fiscal 2012.

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses decreased $43 million to $1,685 million in fiscal 2012 from $1,728 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease resulted
primarily from cost control measures and benefits attributable to restructuring actions, partially offset by the additional selling, general, and administrative expenses of Deutsch. Selling, general,
and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.7% in fiscal 2012 from 12.5% in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the decrease in sales.

Acquisition and Integration Costs.

In connection with the acquisition of Deutsch, we incurred acquisition and integration costs
of $14 million
and $27 million during fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. In connection with the acquisition of ADC, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $19 million during fiscal 2011.

Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.

Net restructuring and other charges were $311 million, $128 million, and
$136 million in
fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. During fiscal 2013, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures impacting all segments. During
fiscal 2012, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce headcount across all segments. Also, we initiated a restructuring program in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments
associated with the acquisition of Deutsch. We initiated a restructuring program during fiscal 2011 which was primarily associated with the acquisition of ADC and related headcount reductions in the
Network Solutions segment. Additionally, in fiscal 2011, we instituted reductions-in-force across all segments as a result of economic conditions. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Operating Income.

Operating income was $1,556 million and $1,518 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Results for fiscal 2013
included $311 million of net restructuring and other charges and $14 million of acquisition and integration costs. Results for fiscal 2012 included $116 million of charges related
to the acquisition of Deutsch, including $75 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and
customer order backlog, $27 million of acquisition and integration costs, and $14 million of net restructuring and other charges. Results for fiscal 2012 also included
$114 million of additional net restructuring and other charges.

Operating
income was $1,518 million and $1,687 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. As discussed above, results for fiscal 2012 included $116 million of
charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch. Results for fiscal 2012 also included $114 million of additional net restructuring and other charges. Results for fiscal 2011 included
$138 million of charges related to the acquisition of ADC, including $80 million of net restructuring and other charges, $39 million of charges associated with the



amortization
of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, and $19 million of acquisition and integration costs. Results
for fiscal 2011 also included $56 million of additional net restructuring and other charges and an additional week which contributed $52 million of operating income.

Non-Operating Items

Interest Expense, Net.

Net interest expense was $125 million, $153 million, and $139 million in fiscal 2013, 2012,
and 2011,
respectively. The decrease of $28 million in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 was due to lower average debt levels, while the increase of $14 million in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 resulted
from higher average debt levels.

Other Income (Expense), Net.

In fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, we recorded net other expense of $183 million, net other
income of
$50 million, and net other income of $27 million, respectively, primarily pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. See Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement. The net other expense in fiscal 2013 included $231 million related to the effective settlement of
all undisputed tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Income Taxes.

Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. We
have provided for
income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation.

The
tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects an income tax benefit of $331 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000.
In addition, the tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects $23 million of net tax benefits primarily consisting of income tax benefits recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation
allowance associated with certain ADC tax loss carryforwards and income tax benefits recognized in connection with the lapse of statutes of limitations for examinations of prior year income tax
returns, partially offset by income tax expense related to adjustments to prior year income tax returns.

We
assessed the realization of ADC's tax loss and credit carryforwards that we acquired in connection with our purchase of ADC, and we believe it is more likely than not that a tax
benefit will be realized on additional U.S. federal and state net operating losses. Based upon the fiscal years 2011 through 2013 U.S. operating results of the ADC business under our management, we
reduced the valuation allowance provided at the date of acquisition and recorded a tax benefit of $63 million. As of fiscal year end 2013, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of
$177 million related to U.S. federal and state ADC tax attributes due to the uncertainty of their realization in the future.

The
tax provision for fiscal 2012 reflects an income tax benefit of $107 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss
carryforwards in certain non-U.S. locations. In addition, the tax provision for fiscal 2012 reflects $17 million of income tax expense associated with certain non-U.S. tax rate changes enacted
in the quarter ended December 30, 2011.

The
tax provision for fiscal 2011 reflects income tax benefits of $35 million associated with the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain U.S. tax matters.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,816 million and $1,719 million at fiscal year end 2013 and 2012, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty
of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable
income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance



was
calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it
is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our
operations. Under the
uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent
to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss
carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to
changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and
related interest. Furthermore, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and
interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate
settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized.

We
have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in the
future. No additional provision has been made for Swiss or non-Swiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences
related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded
that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 27, 2013, certain subsidiaries had approximately $18 billion of cumulative
undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and
research and development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such
subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in
subsidiaries. As of September 27, 2013, we had approximately $4.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability
to distribute to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent
company, but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to approximately $1.5 billion of tax expense would be recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements if our
intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as
permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes.

During fiscal 2012, we sold our Touch Solutions business for
net cash proceeds of
$380 million and recognized an insignificant pre-tax gain on the transaction. The agreement includes contingent earn-out provisions through 2015 based on business performance. In connection
with the divestiture, we incurred an income tax charge of $65 million, which is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of
Operations for fiscal 2012. This charge was primarily driven by the inability to fully realize a tax benefit associated with the write-off of goodwill at the time of the sale.

During
fiscal 2012, we sold our TE Professional Services business for net cash proceeds of $28 million and recognized an insignificant pre-tax gain on the transaction.
Additionally, during fiscal 2012, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $28 million, which is included in income (loss) from



discontinued
operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to write the carrying value of this business down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.

In
December 2011, the New York Court of Claims entered judgment in our favor in the amount of $25 million, payment of which was received in fiscal 2012, in connection with our
former Wireless Systems business's State of New York contract. This judgment resolved all outstanding issues between the parties in this matter. This partial recovery of a previously recognized loss,
net of legal fees, is reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2012.

The
Touch Solutions, TE Professional Services, and Wireless Systems businesses met the discontinued operations criteria and have been included as such in all periods presented on our
Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the Touch Solutions and TE Professional Services businesses were included in the former Communications and
Industrial Solutions segment and the Network Solutions segment, respectively. The Wireless Systems business was a component of the former Wireless Systems segment.

See
Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012

Net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $357 million, or 7.0%, to $5,485 million in fiscal 2013 from
$5,128 million in fiscal 2012. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $54 million, or 1.1%, in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Deutsch
contributed incremental net sales of $160 million during the first six months of fiscal 2013 over the same period of fiscal 2012. Organic net sales increased by $251 million, or 4.9%, in
fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012.



In the automotive end market, our organic net sales increased 4.9% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The increase was due primarily to growth of 9.9% in
the Americas region, 5.1% in the Asia–Pacific region, and 2.2% in the EMEA region. Growth in the Americas region was driven by strong consumer demand resulting in increased vehicle
production. In the Asia–Pacific region, growth was driven by increasing demand in China partially offset by declines in Japan. In the EMEA region, growth resulted primarily from increased
exports to other regions while automotive demand was weak in the EMEA region.

In
fiscal 2013, operating income in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $218 million to $972 million from $754 million in fiscal 2012. Segment results for
fiscal 2013 included $38 million of net restructuring and other charges and $7 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Deutsch. Segment results for
fiscal 2012 included $67 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch, including $42 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value
adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, $16 million of acquisition and integration costs, and $9 million of net restructuring and other charges.
Segment results also included $9 million of additional net restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2012. Excluding these items, operating income increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal
2012. The increase resulted primarily from higher volume, improved manufacturing productivity, and lower material costs, partially offset by price erosion.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011

In fiscal 2012, net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $216 million, or 4.4%, to $5,128 million from
$4,912 million in fiscal 2011. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $181 million, or 3.7%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011
included an additional week which contributed approximately $102 million in net sales. Deutsch contributed net sales of $174 million during fiscal 2012. Organic net sales increased by
$325 million, or 6.6%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011.

In
the automotive end market, our organic net sales increased 6.6% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was due primarily to growth of 15.3% in the
Asia–Pacific region and 11.0% in the Americas region, partially offset by declines of 1.1% in the EMEA region. Growth in the Asia–Pacific region resulted from higher automotive
production and continued recovery following the earthquake in Japan. We estimate that the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our sales in the automotive end market by $38 million in fiscal
2011. In the Americas region, growth resulted from increased production in North America, partially offset by weakness in South America. In the EMEA region, production levels decreased as a result of
financial uncertainty in Europe.

Operating
income in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $25 million to $754 million in fiscal 2012 from $729 million in fiscal 2011. As discussed above,
segment results for fiscal 2012 included $67 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch. Segment results also included $9 million of net charges and $13 million of
net credits to restructuring and other charges (credits) in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Excluding these items, operating income increased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The
increase resulted primarily from higher volume and, to a lesser degree, pricing actions and improved manufacturing productivity.

Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012

In fiscal 2013, net sales in the Network Solutions segment decreased $244 million, or 7.4%, to $3,066 million from
$3,310 million in fiscal 2012. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $16 million, or 0.5%, in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Organic net
sales decreased $192 million, or 5.8%, in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012.

In
the telecom networks end market, our organic net sales decreased 2.2% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as a result of market weakness and decreased capital investments by
customers, particularly in the Asia–Pacific region and, to a lesser degree, the EMEA region. In the data communications end market, our organic net sales decreased 6.3% in fiscal 2013 from
fiscal 2012 as a result of weakness in demand, particularly in the datacenter market. In the enterprise networks end



market,
our organic net sales decreased 3.9% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 with declines resulting primarily from continued market slowdowns in the EMEA region and North America. The
subsea communications end market's organic net sales decreased 17.3% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as a result of lower levels of project activity resulting from customer funding delays.

Operating
income in the Network Solutions segment decreased $111 million to $136 million in fiscal 2013 from $247 million in fiscal 2012. Segment results included
$125 million and $59 million of net restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. Excluding these items, operating income decreased in fiscal 2013 as compared to
fiscal 2012. The decrease resulted from price erosion, lower volume and, to a lesser degree, unfavorable material costs, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011

Net sales in the Network Solutions segment decreased $361 million, or 9.8%, to $3,310 million in fiscal 2012 from
$3,671 million in fiscal 2011. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $66 million, or 1.8%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011
included an additional week which contributed approximately $75 million in net sales. The acquisition of ADC on December 8, 2010 resulted in incremental net sales of $154 million
in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 over the same period of fiscal 2011, as ADC contributed net sales of $198 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 as compared to $44 million in
the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Organic net sales decreased $374 million, or 10.2%, in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011. We estimate that the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our sales in
the Network Solutions segment by $16 million in fiscal 2011.

In
the telecom networks end market, our organic net sales decreased 7.9% in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 due primarily to decreased capital investments by major carriers in the
telecommunications industry, particularly in the Americas and EMEA regions. In the data communications end market, our organic net sales decreased 16.1% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a
result of market softness, primarily in the Asia–Pacific region, and inventory reductions in the supply chain. In the enterprise networks end market, our organic net sales were flat in
fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 levels as declines resulting from weak office network demand were offset by increases resulting from continued data center investments. The subsea communications
end market's organic net sales decreased 15.8% in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 as a result of lower levels of project activity.

In
fiscal 2012, operating income in the Network Solutions segment decreased $53 million to $247 million from $300 million in fiscal 2011. Segment results for fiscal
2012 included $59 million of net restructuring
and other charges. Segment results for fiscal 2011 included $138 million of charges related to the acquisition of ADC, including $80 million of net restructuring and other charges,
$39 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, and
$19 million of acquisition and integration costs. Segment results for fiscal 2011 also included additional net restructuring and other charges of $10 million. Excluding these items,
operating income decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease was attributable to lower volume and, to a lesser degree, price erosion, partially offset by improved manufacturing
productivity.

Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012

Net sales in the Industrial Solutions segment increased $20 million, or 0.7%, to $3,007 million in fiscal 2013 from
$2,987 million in fiscal 2012. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $18 million, or 0.6%, in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Deutsch
contributed incremental net sales of $160 million in the first six months of fiscal 2013 over the same period of fiscal 2012. Organic net sales decreased $122 million, or 4.1%, during
fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012.

In
the industrial end market, our organic net sales decreased 7.7% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to declines in the industrial equipment, solar, and medical
markets. In the aerospace, defense, and marine end market, our organic net sales were flat in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as increased production in the commercial aviation market and
growth in the marine market resulting from increased oil and gas exploration were offset by a slowdown in defense spending. In the energy end market, our organic net sales decreased 4.3% in fiscal
2013 from fiscal 2012 as a result of continued market declines, primarily in the EMEA and Asia–Pacific regions.

In
fiscal 2013, operating income in the Industrial Solutions segment decreased $19 million to $359 million from $378 million in fiscal 2012. Segment results for
fiscal 2013 included $62 million of net restructuring and other charges and $7 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Deutsch. Segment results for
fiscal 2012 included $49 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch, including $33 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-



related
fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, $11 million of acquisition and integration costs, and $5 million of net restructuring
and other charges. Segment results also included $23 million of additional net restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2012. Excluding these items, operating income decreased in fiscal 2013
as compared to fiscal 2012. The decrease was due to lower volume and, to a lesser degree, price erosion, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity and benefits attributable to Deutsch.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011

In fiscal 2012, net sales in the Industrial Solutions segment decreased $157 million, or 5.0%, to $2,987 million from
$3,144 million in fiscal 2011. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $76 million, or 2.4%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011
included an additional week which contributed approximately $53 million in net sales. Deutsch contributed net sales of $153 million in fiscal 2012. Organic net sales decreased
$181 million, or 5.8%, during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. We estimate that the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our sales in the Industrial Solutions segment by
$11 million in fiscal 2011.

In
the industrial end market, our organic net sales decreased 15.1% in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 due to market weakness across all regions. In the aerospace, defense, and marine end
market, our organic net sales increased 5.7% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was attributable to increased production in the commercial aviation market, and growth in the
marine market resulting from share gains and increased oil and gas exploration driven by increased crude oil prices. In the energy end market, our organic net sales were flat in fiscal 2012 as
compared to fiscal 2011 as growth in the Americas and Asia–Pacific regions was offset by declines in the EMEA region.

Operating
income in the Industrial Solutions segment decreased $99 million to $378 million in fiscal 2012 from $477 million in fiscal 2011. As discussed above,
segment results for fiscal 2012 included $49 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch. Segment results also included $23 million and $24 million of additional net
restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Excluding these items, operating income decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease resulted from lower
volume and, to a lesser degree, increased materials costs, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity and pricing actions.

Net sales in the Consumer Solutions segment decreased $135 million, or 7.3%, to $1,722 million in fiscal 2013 from
$1,857 million in fiscal 2012. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $27 million, or 1.5%, in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Organic net
sales decreased $108 million, or 5.8%, during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012.

In
the consumer devices end market, our organic net sales decreased 7.6% in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 due to continuing weakness in the personal computer market, partially offset by
increased demand in the mobile phone and tablet computer markets. In the appliances end market, our organic net sales decreased 3.0% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to declines
in the EMEA and Americas regions.

In
fiscal 2013, operating income in the Consumer Solutions segment decreased $50 million to $89 million from $139 million in fiscal 2012. Segment results included
net restructuring and other charges of $86 million and $23 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. Excluding these items, operating income increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to
fiscal 2012. The increase resulted from improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by price erosion and lower volume.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011

In fiscal 2012, net sales in the Consumer Solutions segment decreased $194 million, or 9.5%, to $1,857 million from
$2,051 million in fiscal 2011. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $15 million, or 0.7%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011
included an additional week which contributed approximately $37 million in net sales. Organic net sales decreased $142 million, or 7.0%, during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. We
estimate that the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our sales in the Consumer Solutions segment by $34 million in fiscal 2011.

In
the consumer devices end market, our organic net sales decreased 6.2% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of weaker demand in the personal computer and consumer
electronics markets, partially offset by strong demand in the tablet computer market and increased demand in the mobile phone market. In the appliances end market, our organic net sales decreased 8.2%
in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 due primarily to weakness in the Asia–Pacific and EMEA regions, resulting from lower demand and inventory reductions in the supply chain, partially offset
by growth in the Americas region.



Operating
income in the Consumer Solutions segment decreased $42 million to $139 million in fiscal 2012 from $181 million in fiscal 2011. Segment results included
$23 million and $35 million of net restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Excluding these items, operating income decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to
fiscal 2011. The decrease resulted from lower volume, increased materials costs, and price erosion, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity.

Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by
our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations
and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future. In October, we called for early redemption
all of our 5.95% senior notes due in January 2014. We may use excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law, to
purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our
authorized share repurchase program, to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares, or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines. The cost or availability of future funding may be
impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions.

As
of September 27, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws,
substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent
company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax costs. We provide for tax liabilities on our Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to amounts that we
expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations. As of
September 27, 2013, we had approximately $4.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to
TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, and TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to approximately $1.5 billion of
tax expense would be recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to
repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.



Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2,048 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to $1,888 million in
fiscal 2012. The increase of $160 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 resulted primarily from higher income levels.

Net
cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,888 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to $1,722 million in fiscal 2011. The increase of $166 million in
fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from improved working capital, partially offset by lower income levels.

Pension
and postretirement benefit contributions in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 were $98 million, $98 million, and $90 million, respectively. We expect pension and
postretirement benefit contributions to be $90 million in fiscal 2014, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. There were no voluntary pension contributions in fiscal 2013, 2012,
and 2011.

The
amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $312 million, $290 million, and $299 million, respectively.

In
fiscal 2013 and 2012, cash payments included $67 million and $70 million, respectively, for tax deficiencies related to U.S. tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000.
Also during fiscal 2013 and 2012, we received net reimbursements of $39 million and $51 million, respectively, from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for
pre-separation U.S. tax matters. Net cash payments related to pre-separation tax matters were $129 million in fiscal 2011. We expect to make net cash payments related to pre-separation tax
matters of approximately $182 million over the next twelve months. These amounts include payments in which we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities and for which we expect a portion
to be reimbursed by Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement as well as indemnification payments to Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement for tax
matters where they are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to pre-separation tax matters.

In
addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. Free cash flow was
$1,500 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to $1,434 million in fiscal 2012 and $1,342 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal
2012 was primarily driven by higher income levels, partially offset by higher capital expenditures as reduced by proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. The increase in free cash
flow in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by improved working capital, as adjusted for net payments for pre-separation tax matters and certain Deutsch acquisition-related
payments totaling $37 million, partially offset by lower income levels.



The
following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Capital spending increased $82 million in fiscal 2013 to $615 million as compared to $533 million in fiscal 2012.
Capital spending was $574 million in fiscal 2011. We expect fiscal 2014 capital spending levels to be approximately 4% to 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to
support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.

During
fiscal 2012, we acquired Deutsch. The total value paid for the transaction amounted to €1.55 billion (approximately $2.05 billion using an exchange
rate of $1.33 per €1.00), net of cash acquired of $152 million. The total value paid included $659 million of debt assumed, including accrued interest, which we paid off
in its entirety shortly after the completion of the acquisition. See additional information in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During
fiscal 2011, we acquired ADC for a total purchase price of approximately $1,263 million in cash (excluding cash acquired of $546 million) and $22 million of
other non-cash consideration. Short-term investments acquired in connection with the acquisition of ADC were sold for proceeds of $155 million in fiscal 2011. Certain other assets acquired in
connection with the acquisition of ADC were sold for net proceeds of $111 million, of which approximately $106 million was received in fiscal 2011. See Note 5 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

During
fiscal 2012, we received net cash proceeds of $370 million related to the sale of our Touch Solutions business and $24 million related to the sale of our TE
Professional Services business. An additional $14 million of cash proceeds was received during fiscal 2013. See additional information in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization

Total debt at fiscal year end 2013 and 2012 was $3,014 million and $3,711 million, respectively. See Note 11 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.

TEGSA,
our 100%-owned subsidiary, has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was
amended in August 2013 primarily to extend the maturity date from June 2016 to August 2018 and reduce borrowing costs. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at September 27, 2013
and September 28, 2012.

Borrowings
under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus an applicable margin
based upon the



senior,
unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Deutsche Bank AG New York branch's base rate, (ii) the federal funds
effective rate plus


/


of 1%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA
is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 7.5 to 25.0 basis points based upon the amount of the lenders' commitments under the Credit Facility and the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA.

The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit
Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as
defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our
operations. As of September 27, 2013, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable
future.

Periodically,
TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper
program are backed by the Credit Facility. As of fiscal year end 2013, TEGSA had $350 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.28%. TEGSA had
$300 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.40% as of fiscal year end 2012.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. Neither TE
Connectivity Ltd. nor any of its subsidiaries provides a guarantee as to payment obligations under the 3.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2015 issued by ADC prior to its acquisition in
December 2010.

On
October 18, 2013, TEGSA called for redemption all of its outstanding 5.95% senior notes due 2014, representing $300 million aggregate principal amount. The redemption
date will be November 18, 2013. We expect to pay an immaterial premium in connection with this early redemption.

Payments
of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders were $384 million, $332 million, and $296 million in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011,
respectively.

In
March 2010, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.72 (equivalent to
$0.64) per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.16 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 through the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We paid the third and fourth
installments of the distribution during the quarters ended December 24, 2010 and March 25, 2011, respectively. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from
CHF 1.73 (equivalent to $1.60) to CHF 1.37 (equivalent to $1.28).

In
March 2011, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 0.68 (equivalent to $0.72) per share out of contributed surplus, payable in four equal quarterly
installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 through the second quarter of fiscal 2012. We paid the installments of the dividend at a rate of $0.18 per share during each of the quarters
ended June 24, 2011, September 30, 2011, December 30, 2011, and March 30, 2012.

In
March 2012, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.80 (equivalent to
$0.84) per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 through the second quarter of fiscal 2013. We paid the installments of the distribution at
a rate of $0.21 per share during each of the quarters ended June 29, 2012, September 28, 2012, December 28, 2012 and March 29, 2013. These capital reductions reduced the
par value of our common shares from CHF 1.37 (equivalent to $1.28) to CHF 0.57 (equivalent to $0.44).



In March 2013, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 0.96 (equivalent to $1.00) per share out of contributed surplus, payable
in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 through the second quarter of fiscal 2014. We paid the first and second installments of the dividend at a rate of
$0.25 per share during each of the quarters ended June 28, 2013 and September 27, 2013.

Future
dividends on our common shares or reductions of registered share capital for distribution to shareholders, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their
discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends or distributions be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial
condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant.

During
fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, we repurchased approximately 20 million of our common shares for $829 million, approximately 6 million of our common shares for
$194 million, and approximately 25 million of our common shares for $867 million, respectively. At September 27, 2013, we had $478 million of availability remaining
under our share repurchase authorization. On October 29, 2013, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1 billion in the share repurchase program.

including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $90 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2014,
before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Other
long-term liabilities of $393 million are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items.

Income Tax Matters

In connection with our separation from Tyco International in 2007, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our,
Tyco International's, and Covidien's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of



business
taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of our shares or the shares of Covidien to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income
tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code.

Pursuant
to the Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under the Tax Sharing
Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The
effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we
have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If
any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of
the defaulting party or
parties' obligation. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are
responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

Prior
to separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined income tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically
examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income
tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies
and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, which relate specifically to our entities have been recorded on the Consolidated Financial
Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Tyco International's and Covidien's tax obligations. Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated
Financial Statements. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

During
fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue Agent
Reports that reflected the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from
alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. The penalties were asserted against a prior subsidiary of Tyco International that was
distributed to us in connection with the separation. Tyco International appealed certain of the proposed adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000, and Tyco International resolved all but one of the
matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments, including reaching an agreement with the IRS on the penalty adjustment in the amount of $21 million. In October 2012, the IRS issued
special agreement Forms 870-AD, effectively settling its audit of all tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000, excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below. As a result
of these developments, in fiscal 2013, we recognized an income tax benefit of $331 million and other expense of $231 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International
and Covidien.

The
disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. The IRS field examination asserted that certain intercompany loans originating during the period
1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately $2.7 billion of related interest deductions recognized during the period on Tyco
International's U.S. income tax returns. In addition, if the IRS is ultimately successful in asserting its claim, it is likely to disallow an additional $6.6 billion of interest deductions
reflected on U.S. income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000. Tyco International contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt



for
U.S. tax purposes and that the interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns are appropriate. The IRS and Tyco International were unable to resolve this matter through the IRS appeals
process. On June 20, 2013, Tyco International advised us that it had received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS for certain former U.S. subsidiaries of Tyco International increasing taxable
income by approximately $2.9 billion in connection with the audit of Tyco International's fiscal years 1997 through 2000. The Notices of Deficiency assert that Tyco International owes
additional taxes totaling $778 million, associated penalties of $154 million, and withholding taxes of $105 million. In addition, Tyco International received Final Partnership
Administrative Adjustments for certain U.S. partnerships owned by former U.S. subsidiaries with respect to which Tyco International estimates an additional tax deficiency of approximately
$30 million will be asserted. The amounts asserted by the IRS exclude any applicable deficiency interest, and do not reflect any impact to subsequent period tax liabilities in the event that
the IRS were to prevail on some or all of its assertions. We understand that Tyco International strongly disagrees with the IRS position and has filed petitions in the U.S. Tax Court contesting the
IRS' proposed adjustments. Tyco International has advised us that it believes there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question and that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are
inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing Treasury regulations.

Resolution
of this matter in the U.S. Tax Court could take several years and no payments to the IRS with respect to these matters would be required until the matter is fully and finally
resolved. In accordance with the terms of a tax sharing agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien would share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of any payments made in connection with these
matters.

However,
as the ultimate outcome is uncertain and if the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, our share of the assessed tax, deficiency interest, and applicable withholding taxes and
penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We have reviewed the Notices of Deficiency, the relevant facts surrounding the
intercompany debt transactions, relevant tax regulations, and applicable case law, and we continue to believe that we are appropriately reserved for this matter.

During
fiscal 2013 and 2012, we made payments of $67 million and $70 million, respectively, for tax deficiencies related to undisputed tax adjustments for the years 1997
through 2000. Concurrent with remitting these payments, during fiscal 2013 and 2012, we were reimbursed $39 million and $51 million, respectively, from Tyco International and Covidien
pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters.

During
fiscal 2011, the IRS completed its field examination of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004, issued Revenue Agent Reports which reflect
the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 2001 through 2004 period, and issued certain notices of deficiency. As a result of the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain
tax matters in fiscal 2011, we recognized income tax benefits of $35 million and other expense of $14 million pursuant
to the Tax Sharing Agreement. Also, in fiscal 2011, we made net cash payments of $154 million related to pre-separation deficiencies.

Tyco
International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 remain subject to adjustment by the IRS upon ultimate resolution of the disputed issue involving certain
intercompany loans originated during the period 1997 through 2000. The IRS commenced its audit of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011, and it
is our understanding that fieldwork for this audit period is expected to be completed in fiscal 2014. Also, during fiscal 2012, the IRS commenced its audit of our income tax returns for the years 2008
through 2010. We expect fieldwork for the 2008 through 2010 audit to conclude in fiscal 2014. Over the next twelve months, we expect to pay approximately $182 million, inclusive of related
indemnification payments, in connection with pre-separation tax matters.



At
September 27, 2013 and September 28, 2012, we have reflected $15 million and $71 million, respectively, of income tax liabilities related to the audits of
Tyco International's and our income tax returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within the next twelve months.

We
believe that the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and
could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims,
product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as
value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it
is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, the proceedings discussed above in "Income Tax Matters" could
have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or
cash flows. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.

At
September 27, 2013, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount
payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the State of Florida in accordance with
guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and
initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which is in the discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the
Consolidated Financial Statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable at this time.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and
financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2014 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of
nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks
involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities
and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At
September 27, 2013, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $376 million.



We
have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of
these liabilities.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results
of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Pursuant
to the Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under the Tax Sharing
Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The
effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we
have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If
any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of
the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These arrangements have been valued upon our separation from Tyco International in accordance with ASC 460 and, accordingly, liabilities amounting to
$223 million were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 27, 2013. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies
are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following accounting policies are considered to be the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions
that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with ASC 605,

Revenue Recognition

.
Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer.
This generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed
and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established
at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is
generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is also recorded as a reduction of sales.

Contract
revenues for construction related projects, which are generated in the Network Solutions segment, are recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Profits
recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total
estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period
in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first
become determinable.



Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Acquired intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets.
Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, as well as customer relationships. Estimates of
recoverability range from 1 to 50 years and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinable-lived intangible assets is performed on
a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess determinable-lived intangible assets for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets
for impairment. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from determinable-lived intangible assets by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of
the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies
on a number of reporting-unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent
uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying these factors to the goodwill impairment analysis.

A
reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly
reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2013, we had eight reporting units, seven of which contained
goodwill. There is one reporting unit in the Transportation Solutions segment, three reporting units in the Network Solutions segment, and two reporting units in both the Industrial Solutions and
Consumer Solutions segments. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in ASC 350,

Intangibles—Goodwill and Other

. First, we
perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting
unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we
compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill,
an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination. We
allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any
excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Fair
value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The
income approach generally has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax
rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in
future periods.

We
completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and determined that no impairment existed.

Income Taxes

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments
affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the



determination
of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and non-U.S.
pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the
forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in
the appropriate jurisdictions. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred
tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Any changes in a valuation
allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition will be reflected in the income tax provision.

Changes
in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we
conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for
issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest
are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon
the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result
in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Furthermore, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing
authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may
result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be
recognized. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our defined benefit pension and
postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement
date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement
factoring in estimated future compensation levels. For the postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial
present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The



fair
value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are
invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected
average remaining service lives of current participants.

Two
critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least
annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience.
Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected
future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2013, a 25
basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $124 million; a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of
our pension obligations by $112 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types
of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2013 pension expense by
$10 million.

During
fiscal 2012, our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. plans' master trust from a previous target of 30% equity and 70% fixed
income to 10% equity and 90% fixed income in an effort to better protect the funded status of the U.S. plans' master trust. Asset reallocation will continue over a multi-year period based on the
funded status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ("the Pension Act Funded Status"), of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions. We expect to reach our target allocation when
the Pension Act Funded Status exceeds 100%. Based on the Pension Act Funded Status as of September 27, 2013, our target asset allocation is 45% equity and 55% fixed income.

Acquisitions

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires, among other things, that most
assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values, or as required by ASC 805,

Business Combinations

. The excess of the purchase price over the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We may engage independent third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

Critical
estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from customer and distributor relationships, acquired developed
technologies, and patents; expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from projects when completed; brand awareness and
market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio; customer and distributor attrition rates; royalty rates; and discount
rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. As a result, actual results may differ from
estimates.



Contingent Liabilities

We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount
of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists, we record the low end of the range. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency
is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. In addition, it is not uncommon for such
matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of
that loss can be made. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a loss is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic Net Sales Growth

Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP
measure) and organic net sales growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, divestitures, and an additional week in the fourth quarter of
the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not
completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and
divestiture activity and the impact of an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. The impact of the

rd

week was estimated using an average weekly sales figure for the last month of the fiscal year.

We
believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it
provides investors with a view of our operations from management's perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying
results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations
of our reporting segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and
analysis of organic net sales growth in "Results of Operations" above utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among
other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented above may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that
is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales. This limitation
is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables presented in "Results of Operations" above provide reconciliations of organic net sales
growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities (the most
comparable GAAP measure) and free cash flow (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. Free cash flow is a useful measure
of our ability to generate cash. It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe free cash flow provides useful information



to
investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations.

Free
cash flow is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items, minus net capital
expenditures. Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. They are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments.
Voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net
payments related to pre-separation tax matters, also are considered by management in evaluating free cash flow. We believe investors should also consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow.

Free
cash flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that
have an impact on our GAAP cash flow. Also, it subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the board of directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or
more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using free cash flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow results. It
should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain non-discretionary
expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered
in the calculation of free cash flow.

The
tables presented in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under GAAP.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain statements in this report are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. These statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include, among others, the
information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance
improvements, acquisitions, the effects of competition, and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be
identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words "believe," "expect," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue," "may," "should," or the
negative of these terms or similar expressions.

Forward-looking
statements involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. You should not
put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We do not have any intention or obligation to update forward-looking statements after we file this report except as required by law.

The
following and other risks, which are described in greater detail in "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors," as well as other risks described in this Annual Report, could also
cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements:

•

conditions in the global or regional economies and global capital markets, and cyclical industry conditions;

•

conditions affecting demand for products in the industries we serve, particularly the automotive industry;

•

competition and pricing pressure;



•

market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations and product life cycles;

•

raw material availability, quality, and cost;

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

financial condition and consolidation of customers and vendors;

•

reliance on third-party suppliers;

•

risks associated with future acquisitions and divestitures;

•

global risks of business interruptions such as natural disasters and political, economic, and military instability;

•

risks related to compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations;

•

our ability to protect our intellectual property rights;

•

risks of litigation;

•

our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by our debt instruments;

•

risks relating to our separation on June 29, 2007 from Tyco International Ltd.;

•

the possible effects on us of various U.S. and non-U.S. legislative proposals and other initiatives that, if adopted,
could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate and negatively impact our U.S. government contracts business;

•

various risks associated with being a Swiss corporation;

•

the impact of fluctuations in the market price of our shares; and

•

the impact of certain provisions of our articles of association on unsolicited takeover proposals.

There
may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated
with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements. We utilize established risk management policies and
procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks.

We
do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are
limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 credit rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty.

Foreign Currency Exposures

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize foreign currency forward and swap contracts,
a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
intercompany and other cash transactions. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our foreign currency forward or swap contracts from the September 27, 2013 market
rates would have changed the unrealized value of our forward and swap



contracts
by $27 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our foreign currency forward or swap contracts from the September 28, 2012 market rates would
have changed the unrealized value of our forward and swap contracts by $35 million. Such gains or losses on these contracts would be generally offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation
or settlement of the underlying transactions.

Interest Rate and Investment Exposures

We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To
manage the interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. We use forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into
interest rate swaps ("swaptions") to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt. We also utilize investment swaps to manage earnings exposure on
certain non-qualified deferred compensation liabilities.

During
fiscal 2011, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on $150 million principal amount of the 4.875% senior notes due 2021. The maturity dates of
the interest rate swaps coincide with the maturity date of the notes. Under these contracts, we receive fixed amounts of interest applicable to the underlying notes and pay a floating amount based
upon the three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR.

Based
on our floating rate debt balances of approximately $150 million at September 27, 2013 and $200 million at September 28, 2012, an increase in the levels
of the U.S. Dollar interest rates by 0.5%, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately $1 million in fiscal 2013 and
2012.

Commodity Exposures

Our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the effects of
fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges. We continually evaluate the commodity market with
respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts in order to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period. At
September 27, 2013, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, and copper, were in a net loss position of $27 million and had a notional value of
$278 million. At September 28, 2012, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold and silver, were in a net gain position of $17 million and had a notional
value of $246 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold, a troy ounce of silver, and a pound of copper, from the September 27, 2013 prices would
have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $25 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold and a troy ounce of silver from the
September 28, 2012 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $26 million.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 27, 2013. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 27, 2013.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 27, 2013.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.



Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of
September 27, 2013, which is included in this Annual Report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the quarter ended September 27, 2013, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The
TE Connectivity Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "2007 Plan"), provides for the award of annual performance
bonuses and long-term performance awards, including share options, restricted and performance units, deferred stock units, and other share-based awards (collectively, "Awards") to board members,
officers, and non-officer employees. The 2007 Plan provides for a maximum of 59,843,452 common shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2007 Plan.

(2)

Includes
common shares that may be issued by TE Connectivity pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement under equity awards, including share
options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and deferred stock units, granted to current and former employees and directors of Tyco International, which may include individuals currently or
formerly employed by or serving with TE Connectivity, Tyco International, or Covidien subsequent to the separation.

(3)

In
connection with the acquisition of ADC in December 2010, we assumed equity awards issued under plans sponsored by ADC and the remaining pool of shares
available for grant under the ADC 2010 Global Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the "ADC Plans"). Subsequent to the acquisition, we registered 6,764,455 shares related to the ADC Plans via
Forms S-3 and S-8. Shares available represent the number of shares available for issuance under future awards from the ADC Plans, which are now available for issuance of TE Connectivity common
shares. During fiscal 2012, the ADC 2010 Global Stock Incentive Plan was renamed the TE Connectivity Ltd. 2010 Stock and Incentive Plan.

(4)

Does
not take into account restricted, performance, or deferred stock unit awards that do not have exercise prices.

(5)

The
2007 Plan applies a weighting factor of 1.80 to outstanding non-vested restricted shares, restricted share units, deferred stock units, and performance
units. The ADC Plans apply a weighting factor of 1.21 to outstanding non-vested restricted shares, restricted share units, deferred stock units, and performance units. The remaining shares issuable
under both the 2007 Plan and the ADC Plans are increased by forfeitures and cancellations, among other factors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of TE Connectivity Ltd.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 27, 2013 and September 28,
2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 27, 2013. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 27, 2013 and
September 28, 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 27, 2013, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
September 27, 2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(1992) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 15, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of TE Connectivity Ltd.:

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 27, 2013, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2013, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2013, and our report dated



November 15,
2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of TE Connectivity Ltd. and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") Dollars in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").

Description of the Business

TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") is a world leader in
connectivity. We design and manufacture products to connect power, data, and signal in a broad array of industries including automotive, energy, industrial, broadband communications, consumer devices,
healthcare, and aerospace and defense. We help our customers solve the need for more energy efficiency, always-on communications, and ever-increasing productivity.

We
consist of four reportable segments:

•

Transportation Solutions.

The Transportation Solutions
segment is a leader in electronic components, including terminals and connectors, relays, and sensors, as well as application tooling, wire and heat shrink tubing, and other custom-engineered
solutions for the automotive market including the industrial and commercial vehicle and hybrid and electric vehicle markets.

•

Network Solutions.

The Network Solutions segment is one of
the world's largest suppliers of infrastructure components and systems for the telecommunications market and electronic components for the data communications market. Our products include connectors,
fiber optics, wire and cable, racks and panels, and wireless products. We also are a leader in developing, manufacturing, installing, and maintaining some of the world's most advanced subsea fiber
optic communications systems.

•

Industrial Solutions.

The Industrial Solutions segment is
a leading supplier of products that connect and distribute power and data, including connectors, heat shrink tubing, relays, and wire and cable, as well as custom-engineered solutions. Our products
are used primarily in the industrial; aerospace, defense, and marine; and energy markets.

•

Consumer Solutions.

The Consumer Solutions segment is a
top supplier of electronic components, including connectors, circuit protection devices, relays, antennas, and heat shrink tubing, for the consumer devices and appliances markets.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in these
Consolidated Financial Statements include restructuring and other charges, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future
cash flows and discount rates associated with asset impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, estimated contract revenue and
related costs, legal contingencies, tax reserves and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension and postretirement employee
benefit expenses. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation (Continued)

Fiscal Year

Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012, and fiscal 2011 are to our
fiscal years ended September 27, 2013, September 28, 2012, and September 30, 2011, respectively. Our fiscal year is a "52-53 week" year ending on the last Friday of
September, such that each quarterly period is 13 weeks in length. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period will include 14 weeks. Fiscal
2013 and 2012 were each 52 weeks in length. Fiscal 2011 was a 53 week year.

Reclassifications

We have reclassified certain items on our Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the current year presentation.

Company Name Change

In March 2011, our shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of association to change our name from "Tyco
Electronics Ltd." to "TE Connectivity Ltd." The name change was effective March 10, 2011. Our ticker symbol "TEL" on the New York Stock Exchange remained unchanged.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

We consolidate entities in which we own or control more than fifty percent of the voting shares or otherwise have the ability to
control through similar rights. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included on the Consolidated Financial Statements from the
effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title
and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably
assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue.

Contract
revenues for construction related projects, which are generated in the Network Solutions segment, are recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Profits
recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total
estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing
profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to construction
related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable.

We
generally warrant that our products will conform to our or mutually agreed to specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for
a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts or a refund or credit of the



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

price
of the defective product. We accept returned goods only when the customer makes a verified claim and we have authorized the return. Returns result primarily from defective products or shipping
discrepancies. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Additionally,
certain of our long-term contracts in the Network Solutions segment have warranty obligations. Estimated warranty costs for each contract are determined based on the
contract terms and technology-specific considerations. These costs are included in total estimated contract costs and are accrued over the construction period of the respective contracts under
percentage-of-completion accounting.

We
provide certain distributors with an inventory allowance for returns or scrap equal to a percentage of qualified purchases. A reserve for estimated returns and scrap allowances is
established at the time of the sale, based on a fixed percentage of sales to distributors authorized and agreed to by us, and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Other
allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is
recorded as a reduction of sales. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate the amounts of future allowances.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in our outstanding receivables
after consideration of aging, known troubled accounts, and other currently available information.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value using the first-in, first-out cost method, except for inventoried costs
incurred in the performance of long-term contracts primarily by the Network Solutions segment.

Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net and Long-Lived Assets

Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to
expense when incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 10 to 20 years for land improvements, 5 to
40 years for buildings and improvements, and 1 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.

We
periodically evaluate, when events and circumstances warrant, the net realizable value of long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment and amortizable intangible
assets, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

future
cash flows. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the asset group are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted
cash
flows of the underlying asset group. Impairment of the carrying value of an asset group is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset group are estimated to be less
than its carrying value. The amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions
concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Acquired intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets.
Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, as well as customer relationships. Estimates of
recoverability range from 1 to 50 years and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. See Note 9 for additional information regarding intangible assets. An evaluation of the
remaining useful life of determinable-lived intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess determinable-lived intangible assets
for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets for impairment. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from determinable-lived intangible assets by comparing
the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment
has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting-unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections,
anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying these factors to the goodwill
impairment analysis.

At
fiscal year end 2013, we had eight reporting units, seven of which contained goodwill. There is one reporting unit in the Transportation Solutions segment, three reporting units in
the Network Solutions segment, and two reporting units in both the Industrial Solutions and Consumer Solutions segments. See Note 8 for information regarding goodwill impairment testing. When
changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its
carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if
any. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill
exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how
goodwill is recognized in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting
unit had been acquired in a business
combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Fair
value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The
income approach generally has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax
rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in
future periods.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in research, development, and engineering expenses in
our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred, and building and overhead expenses. The amounts expensed in fiscal 2013, 2012, and
2011 were $576 million, $595 million, and $593 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740,

Income Taxes

. Deferred tax
liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected on the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss
carryforwards using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available
evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt, and derivative
financial instruments.

We
account for derivative financial instrument contracts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. For instruments not designated as hedges under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, the changes in
the instruments' fair value are recognized currently in earnings. For instruments designated as cash flow
hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
underlying hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of a cash flow hedge, including amounts excluded from the hedging relationship, are recognized currently in earnings. Changes in the fair
value of instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or liability hedged, with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability being
recognized currently in earnings.

We
determine the fair value of our financial instruments by using methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. Standard
market conventions are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, including derivatives.

The
cash flows related to derivative financial instruments are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Our
derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks. Concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated, however, as we deal with financial institutions
worldwide, substantially all of which have long-term Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, only conventional derivative financial instruments
are utilized. We are exposed to potential losses if a counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of its agreement. With respect to counterparty net asset positions recognized at
September 27, 2013, we have assessed the likelihood of counterparty default as remote. We currently provide guarantees from a wholly-owned subsidiary to the counterparties to our commodity swap
derivatives. The likelihood of performance on those guarantees has been assessed as remote. For all other derivative financial instruments, we are not required to provide, nor do we require
counterparties to provide, collateral or other security.

See
Note 14 for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments.

Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

, specifies a fair value hierarchy
based upon the observable inputs utilized in valuation of certain assets and liabilities. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable
inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. Fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:

•

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets and liabilities.

•

Level 2.

Quoted prices in active markets for
similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

•

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are supported by
little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flows methodologies, and similar techniques
that use significant unobservable inputs.

The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis:

•

Commodity swap contracts.

Fair value of these assets and
liabilities is determined using quoted prices on futures exchanges (level 1).

•

Interest rate swaps and swaptions.

Fair value of these
assets and liabilities is determined based on observable inputs other than quoted prices. The positions are primarily valued using market approach models that use readily observable interest rates as
their basis (level 2).

•

Investment swap contracts.

Fair value of these assets is
determined based on observable inputs other than quoted prices. The positions are primarily valued using market approach models that use readily observable equity returns as their basis
(level 2).

•

Foreign currency contracts.

Fair value of these assets
and liabilities is determined using the market approach. Values are based on observable market transactions of spot and forward currency rates (level 2).



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

•

Rabbi trust assets.

Rabbi trust assets are principally
comprised of equity funds that are marked to fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (level 1) and fixed income securities that are marked to fair value based on quoted
market prices or other pricing determinations based on the results of market approach valuation models using observable market data such as recently reported trades, bid and offer information, and
benchmark securities (level 2).

Financial
instruments other than derivative instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and long-term debt. These instruments are recorded on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets at book value. For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, we believe book value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of
these instruments. See Note 11 for disclosure of the fair value of debt. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial
instruments:

•

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents are
valued at book value, which we consider to be equivalent to unadjusted quoted prices (level 1).

•

Accounts receivable.

Accounts receivable are valued based
on the net value expected to be realized. The net realizable value generally represents an observable contractual agreement (level 2).

•

Accounts payable.

Accounts payable are valued based on the
net value expected to be paid, generally supported by an observable contractual agreement (level 2).

•

Long-term debt.

The fair value of long-term debt,
including both current and non-current maturities, is derived from quoted market prices or other pricing determinations based on the results of market approach valuation models using observable market
data such as recently reported trades, bid and offer information, and benchmark securities (level 2).

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

The funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected
benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. For the postretirement benefit
plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already
rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of
participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected
average remaining service lives of current participants.

The
measurement of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on estimates and assumptions determined by our management. These valuations reflect the terms of the plans
and use



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

participant-specific
information such as compensation, age, and years of service, as well as certain assumptions, including estimates of discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of
compensation increases, interest crediting rates, and mortality rates.

Share-Based Compensation

We determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant. Share options are valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation
model; restricted share awards and performance awards are valued using our end-of-day share price on the date of grant. That fair value is expensed ratably over the expected service period, with an
allowance made for estimated forfeitures based on historical employee activity. Estimates regarding the attainment of performance criteria are periodically reviewed; the cumulative impact of a change
in estimate regarding the attainment of performance criteria is recorded in the period in which that change is made. See Note 22 for additional information related to share-based compensation.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. is computed by dividing net income attributable to TE
Connectivity Ltd. by the basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. is computed by dividing net income
attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation arrangements.

Currency Translation

For our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using fiscal year end
exchange rates. Sales and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
within equity.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, which are included in earnings, were immaterial amounts in fiscal 2013 and 2011. Such gains were $18 million during
fiscal 2012.

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring activities involve employee-related termination costs, facility exit costs, and asset impairments resulting from
reductions-in-force, migration of facilities or product lines from higher-cost to lower-cost countries, or consolidation of facilities within countries. We recognize termination costs based on
requirements established per severance policy, government law, or previous actions. Facility exit costs generally reflect the cost to terminate a facility lease before the end of its term (measured at
fair value at the time we cease using the facility) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the facility lease without future economic benefit to us. Restructuring activities often result in
the disposal or abandonment of assets that require an acceleration of depreciation or impairment reflecting the excess of the assets' carrying values over fair value.

The
recognition of restructuring costs require that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing, and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
To the extent our actual results differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

estimated
liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring costs or the reduction of liabilities already recognized. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining
accrued balances to ensure these balances are properly stated and the utilization of the reserves are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans. See Note 3 for
additional information on restructuring activities.

Acquisitions

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires, among other things, that most
assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values, or as required by ASC 805,

Business Combinations

. The excess of the purchase price over the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We may engage independent third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

Contingent Liabilities

We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount
of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists, we record the low end of the range. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency
is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. In addition, it is not uncommon for such
matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of
that loss can be made. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a loss is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided.

Fiscal 2013 Actions

During fiscal 2013, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures impacting
all segments. In connection with this program, we recorded net restructuring charges of $308 million primarily related to employee severance and benefits and fixed assets in connection with
exited manufacturing sites' product lines. We expect to complete all restructuring programs commenced in fiscal 2013 by the end of fiscal 2015 and to incur total charges of approximately
$355 million. Cash spending related to this program was $83 million in fiscal 2013.

Pre-Fiscal 2011 Actions

We initiated a restructuring program during fiscal 2010 primarily related to headcount reductions in the Transportation Solutions
segment. During fiscal 2009, we initiated a restructuring program primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures across all segments in response to economic conditions and
implementation of our manufacturing simplification plan. Also, we initiated a restructuring program during fiscal 2008 primarily relating to the migration of product lines to lower-cost countries and
the exit of certain manufacturing operations in the Transportation Solutions and Network Solutions segments. We have completed all restructuring programs commenced in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008.

In
connection with these actions, during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, we recorded net restructuring credits of $4 million, charges of $5 million, and credits of
$26 million, respectively. The credits in fiscal 2011 related primarily to decreases in planned employee headcount reductions associated with the Industrial Solutions and Transportation
Solutions segments. Cash spending related to pre-fiscal 2011 actions was $11 million in fiscal 2013.

4. Discontinued Operations

During fiscal 2012, we sold our Touch Solutions business for net cash proceeds of $380 million and recognized an insignificant pre-tax gain on the transaction. The agreement
includes contingent earn-out provisions through 2015 based on business performance. In connection with the divestiture, we incurred an income tax charge of $65 million, which is included in
income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2012. This charge was primarily driven by the inability to fully realize a tax
benefit associated with the write-off of goodwill at the time of the sale.

During
fiscal 2012, we sold our TE Professional Services business for net cash proceeds of $28 million and recognized an insignificant pre-tax gain on the transaction.
Additionally, during fiscal 2012, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $28 million, which is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the
Consolidated Statement of Operations, to write the carrying value of this business down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.

In
December 2011, the New York Court of Claims entered judgment in our favor in the amount of $25 million, payment of which was received in fiscal 2012, in connection with our
former Wireless Systems business's State of New York contract. This judgment resolved all outstanding issues between the parties in this matter. This partial recovery of a previously recognized loss,
net of legal fees, is reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2012.

The
following table presents net sales, pre-tax income (loss), pre-tax gain (loss) on sale, and income tax (expense) benefit from discontinued operations:

Communications and Industrial Solutions segment and the Network Solutions segment, respectively. The Wireless Systems business was a component of the former Wireless Systems segment.

5. Acquisitions

Fiscal 2012 Acquisition

On April 3, 2012, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Deutsch Group SAS ("Deutsch"). The total value paid for the
transaction amounted to €1.55 billion (approximately



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

5. Acquisitions (Continued)

$2.05 billion
using an exchange rate of $1.33 per €1.00), net of cash acquired. The total value paid included $659 million related to the repayment of Deutsch's financial
debt and accrued interest. Deutsch is a global leader in high-performance connectors for harsh environments, and significantly expands our product portfolio and enables us to better serve customers in
the industrial and commercial transportation; aerospace, defense, and marine; and rail markets. We realized cost savings and other synergies through operational efficiencies. The acquired Deutsch
businesses have been reported in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments from the date of acquisition.

During
fiscal 2012, we finalized the valuation of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the
fair value of identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting:

current assets primarily consisted of inventories of $189 million and trade accounts receivable of $121 million. Other current liabilities primarily
consisted of accrued and other current liabilities of $76 million and trade accounts payable of $56 million.

The
fair values assigned to intangible assets were determined through the use of the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty and the multi-period excess earnings methods.
Both valuation methods rely on management judgment, including expected future cash flows resulting from existing customer relationships, customer attrition rates, contributory effects of other assets
utilized in the business, peer group cost of capital and royalty rates, and other factors. The valuation of tangible assets was derived using a combination of the income, market, and cost approaches.
Significant judgments used in valuing tangible assets include estimated reproduction or replacement cost, useful lives of assets, estimated selling prices, costs to complete, and reasonable profit.
Useful lives for intangible assets were determined based upon the remaining useful economic lives of the intangible assets that are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows.

The
acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected lives.

Goodwill
of $1,042 million was recognized in the transaction, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. This goodwill is attributable primarily to cost savings and other synergies related to operational efficiencies including the consolidation of manufacturing, marketing, and
general and administrative functions. The
goodwill has been allocated to the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and is not deductible for tax purposes. However, prior to its merger with us, Deutsch completed certain
acquisitions that resulted in approximately $215 million of goodwill that is deductible primarily for U.S. tax purposes, which we will deduct through 2025.

During
fiscal 2012, Deutsch contributed net sales of $327 million and an operating loss of $54 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The operating loss
included charges of $75 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, acquisition
costs of $21 million, restructuring charges of $14 million, and integration costs of $6 million.

Fiscal 2011 Acquisition

In July 2010, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") to acquire 100% of the outstanding stock of ADC
Telecommunications, Inc. ("ADC"), a provider of broadband communications network connectivity products and related solutions. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender offer
through a subsidiary to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of ADC common stock at a purchase price of $12.75 per share in cash followed by a merger of the subsidiary with and into ADC,
with ADC surviving as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary. On December 8, 2010, we acquired 86.8% of the outstanding common shares of ADC. On December 9, 2010, we exercised our option
under the Merger Agreement to purchase additional shares from ADC that, when combined with the shares purchased in the tender offer, were sufficient to give us ownership of more than 90% of the
outstanding ADC common shares. On December 9, 2010, upon effecting a short-form merger under Minnesota law, we owned 100% of the outstanding shares of ADC for a total purchase price of
approximately $1,263 million in cash (excluding cash acquired of $546 million) and $22 million representing the fair value of ADC share-based awards exchanged for
TE Connectivity share options and stock appreciation rights.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

5. Acquisitions (Continued)

Based
on the terms and conditions of ADC's share option and stock appreciation right ("SAR") awards (the "ADC Awards"), all ADC Awards became exercisable upon completion of the
acquisition. Each outstanding ADC Award was exchanged for approximately 0.4 TE Connectivity share options or SARs and resulted in approximately 3 million TE Connectivity share options being
issued with a weighted-average exercise price of $38.88. Issued SARs and the associated liability were insignificant. The fair value associated with the exchange of ADC Awards for TE Connectivity
awards was approximately $24 million based on Black-Scholes-Merton pricing valuation model, of which $22 million was recorded as consideration given in the acquisition, and the remaining
$2 million was recorded as acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during fiscal 2011.

The
acquisition was made to accelerate our growth potential in the global broadband connectivity market. We realized cost savings and other synergies through operational efficiencies.
The acquired ADC businesses have been included in the Network Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.

We
completed the valuation of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed during fiscal 2011. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair

approximately
$106 million was received prior to September 30, 2011. Other current liabilities assumed include accrued and other current liabilities of $165 million and trade

methods. The valuation of tangible assets was derived using a combination of the income, market, and cost approaches. Useful lives for intangible assets were determined based upon the remaining useful

The
acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected lives.

The
$366 million of goodwill is attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The
goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to cost savings and other synergies related to operational efficiencies including the consolidation of manufacturing, marketing, and general and
administrative functions. All of the goodwill has been allocated to the Network Solutions segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. However, prior to its merger with us, ADC completed certain
acquisitions that resulted in approximately $346 million of goodwill that is deductible for U.S. tax purposes, which we will deduct through 2021. These future tax deductions have been
considered in our valuation allowance assessment of the realization of the ADC U.S. federal and U.S. state tax loss and credit carryforwards.

During
fiscal 2011, ADC contributed net sales of $843 million and an operating loss of $53 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The operating loss included
restructuring charges of $80 million, charges of $39 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and
customer order backlog, integration costs of $10 million, and acquisition costs of $9 million.

of income tax expense (benefit) at the statutory rate.

Pro
forma results for fiscal 2012 were adjusted to exclude $30 million of charges related to the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventories, $29 million of
interest expense based on pro forma changes in our capital structure, $20 million of income tax expense based on the estimated impact of combining Deutsch into our global tax position,
$14 million of charges related to acquired customer order backlog, $13 million of acquisition costs, $4 million of charges related to other acquisition-related adjustments,
$2 million of share-based compensation expense incurred by Deutsch as a result of the change in control of Deutsch, and $2 million of charges related to depreciation expense. In
addition, pro forma results for fiscal 2012 were adjusted to include $10 million of charges related to the amortization of the fair value of acquired intangible assets.

Pro
forma results for fiscal 2011 were adjusted to exclude $39 million of interest expense based on pro forma changes in our capital structure, $20 million of income tax
expense based on the estimated impact of combining Deutsch into our global tax position, $15 million of share-based compensation expense incurred by ADC as a result of the change in control of
ADC, $13 million of acquisition costs, and $5 million of charges related to depreciation expense. In addition, pro forma results for fiscal 2011 were adjusted to include
$20 million of charges related to the amortization of the fair value of acquired intangible assets, $15 million of charges related to the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date
inventories, $7 million of charges related to acquired customer order backlog, and $4 million of charges related to other acquisition-related adjustments.

Pro
forma results do not include any synergies. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results
that might have been achieved had the Deutsch and ADC acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the preceding fiscal years.

11. Debt (Continued)

Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit
Facility") with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in August 2013 primarily to extend the maturity date from June 2016 to August 2018 and reduce
borrowing costs. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at September 27, 2013 and September 28, 2012.

Borrowings
under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus an applicable margin
based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Deutsche Bank AG New York branch's base rate, (ii) the
federal funds effective rate plus


/


of 1%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating
of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 7.5 to 25.0 basis points based upon the amount of the lenders' commitments under the Credit Facility and the applicable credit
ratings of TEGSA.

The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit
Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as
defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants.

Periodically,
TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper
program are backed by the Credit Facility.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. Neither TE
Connectivity Ltd. nor any of its subsidiaries provides a guarantee as to payment obligations under the 3.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2015 issued by ADC prior to its acquisition in
December 2010.

12. Guarantees

Tax Sharing Agreement

Effective June 29, 2007, we became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International Ltd.
("Tyco International"). On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of our shares, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders
(the "separation").

Upon
separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, under which we share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a
sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. We, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from
adjustments made by tax authorities to our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities
settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to
31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are
shared equally among the parties. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's
sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

All
of the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses, including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from Tyco International, became our tax liabilities. Although
we have agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco
International and Covidien default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for
all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and
required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's
tax liabilities.

Indemnification

Our indemnification created under the Tax Sharing Agreement qualifies as a guarantee of a third party entity's debt under ASC 460,

Guarantees

. ASC 460 addresses the measurement and disclosure of a guarantor's obligation to pay a debt incurred by a third party. To value the initial
guarantee obligation, we considered a range of probability-weighted future cash flows that represented the likelihood of payment of each class of liability by each of the three post-separation
companies. The expected cash flows incorporated interest and penalties that the companies believed would be incurred on each class of liabilities and were discounted to the present value to reflect
the value associated with each at separation. The calculation of the guarantee liability also included a premium that reflected the cost for an insurance carrier to stand in and assume the payment
obligation at the separation date.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

12. Guarantees (Continued)

At
inception of the guarantee, based on the probability-weighted future cash flows related to unresolved tax matters, we, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, faced a maximum potential
liability of $3 billion, based on undiscounted estimates and interest and penalties used to determine the fair value
of the guarantee and an assumption of 100% default on the parts of Tyco International and Covidien, a likelihood that management believes to be remote. In the event that we are required, due to
bankruptcy or other business interruption on the part of Tyco International or Covidien, to pay more than the contractually determined 31%, we retain the right to seek payment from the effected
entity.

At
September 27, 2013, we had a liability representing the indemnifications made to Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement of $223 million of
which $185 million was reflected in accrued and other current liabilities and $38 million was reflected in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At September 28,
2012, the liability was $241 million and consisted of $14 million in accrued and other current liabilities and $227 million in other liabilities. The amount reflected in accrued
and other current liabilities is our estimated cash obligation under the Tax Sharing Agreement to Tyco International and Covidien in connection with pre-separation tax matters that could be resolved
within the next twelve months.

We
have assessed the probable future cash payments to Tyco International and Covidien for pre-separation income tax matters pursuant to the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement and
determined that $223 million is sufficient to satisfy these expected obligations.

Other Matters

In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including
unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing
facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At
September 27, 2013, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $376 million.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results
of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

We
generally record estimated product warranty costs when contract revenues are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method for construction related contracts and at the time of
sale for products. The estimation is primarily based on historical experience and actual warranty claims.
Amounts accrued for warranty claims at fiscal year end 2013 and 2012 were $38 million and $48 million, respectively.

13. Commitments and Contingencies

General Matters

We have facility, land, vehicle, and equipment leases that expire at various dates. Rental expense under these leases was
$154 million, $160 million, and $158 million for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011,

Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims,
product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as
value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and
applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results
of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, the proceedings discussed below in "Income Tax Matters" could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or
cash flows.

At
September 27, 2013, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount
payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the State of Florida in accordance with
guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and
initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which is in the discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the
Consolidated Financial Statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable at this time.

Income Tax Matters

In connection with the separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our, Tyco International's, and
Covidien's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any
failure of the distribution of all of our shares or the shares of Covidien to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the
Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code.

Pursuant
to the Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under the Tax Sharing



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

Agreement,
we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. See
Note 12 for additional information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement.

Prior
to separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined income tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically
examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and
contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax
position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes,

which relate specifically to our entities have been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In
addition, we may be required to fund portions of Tyco International's and Covidien's tax obligations. Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated Financial
Statements. See Note 12 for additional information.

During
fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue Agent
Reports that reflected the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from
alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. The penalties were asserted against a prior subsidiary of Tyco International that was
distributed to us in connection with the separation. Tyco International appealed certain of the proposed adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000, and Tyco International resolved all but one of the
matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments, including reaching an agreement with the IRS on the penalty adjustment in the amount of $21 million. In October 2012, the IRS issued
special agreement Forms 870-AD, effectively settling its audit of all tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000, excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below. As a result
of these developments, in fiscal 2013, we recognized an income tax benefit of $331 million and other expense of $231 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International
and Covidien.

The
disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. The IRS field examination asserted that certain intercompany loans originating during the period
1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately $2.7 billion of related interest deductions recognized during the period on Tyco
International's U.S. income tax returns. In addition, if the IRS is ultimately successful in asserting its claim, it is likely to disallow an additional $6.6 billion of interest deductions
reflected on U.S. income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000. Tyco International contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt for U.S. tax purposes and that the interest
deductions reflected on the income tax returns are appropriate. The IRS and Tyco International were unable to resolve this matter through the IRS appeals process. On June 20, 2013, Tyco
International advised us that it had received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS for certain former U.S. subsidiaries of Tyco International increasing taxable income by approximately
$2.9 billion in connection with the audit of Tyco International's fiscal years 1997 through 2000. The Notices of Deficiency assert that Tyco International owes additional taxes totaling
$778 million, associated penalties of $154 million, and withholding taxes of $105 million. In addition, Tyco International received Final Partnership Administrative Adjustments
for certain U.S. partnerships owned by former U.S. subsidiaries with respect to which Tyco International estimates an



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

additional
tax deficiency of approximately $30 million will be asserted. The amounts asserted by the IRS exclude any applicable deficiency interest, and do not reflect any impact to subsequent
period tax liabilities in the event that the IRS were to prevail on some or all of its assertions. We understand that Tyco International strongly disagrees with the IRS position and has filed
petitions in the U.S. Tax Court contesting the IRS' proposed adjustments. Tyco International has advised us that it believes there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question and that the
IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing Treasury regulations.

Resolution
of this matter in the U.S. Tax Court could take several years and no payments to the IRS with respect to these matters would be required until the matter is fully and finally
resolved. In accordance with the terms of a tax sharing agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien would share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of any payments made in connection with these
matters.

However,
as the ultimate outcome is uncertain and if the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, our share of the assessed tax, deficiency interest, and applicable withholding taxes and
penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We have reviewed the Notices of Deficiency, the relevant facts surrounding the
intercompany debt transactions, relevant tax regulations, and applicable case law, and we continue to believe that we are appropriately reserved for this matter.

During
fiscal 2013 and 2012, we made payments of $67 million and $70 million, respectively, for tax deficiencies related to undisputed tax adjustments for the years 1997
through 2000. Concurrent with remitting these payments, during fiscal 2013 and 2012, we were reimbursed $39 million and $51 million, respectively, from Tyco International and Covidien
pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters.

During
fiscal 2011, the IRS completed its field examination of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004, issued Revenue Agent Reports which reflect
the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 2001 through 2004 period, and issued certain notices of deficiency. As a result of the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain
tax matters in fiscal 2011, we recognized income tax benefits of $35 million and other expense of $14 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement. Also, in fiscal 2011, we made net
cash payments of $154 million related to pre-separation deficiencies.

Tyco
International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 remain subject to adjustment by the IRS upon ultimate resolution of the disputed issue involving certain
intercompany loans originated during the period 1997 through 2000. The IRS commenced its audit of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011, and it
is our understanding that fieldwork for this audit period is expected to be completed in fiscal 2014. Also,
during fiscal 2012, the IRS commenced its audit of our income tax returns for the years 2008 through 2010. We expect fieldwork for the 2008 through 2010 audit to conclude in fiscal 2014. Over the next
twelve months, we expect to pay approximately $182 million, inclusive of related indemnification payments, in connection with pre-separation tax matters.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

At
September 27, 2013 and September 28, 2012, we have reflected $15 million and $71 million, respectively, of income tax liabilities related to the audits of
Tyco International's and our income tax returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within the next twelve months.

We
believe that the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and
could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Environmental Matters

We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The
ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative
cleanup methods. As of fiscal year end 2013, we concluded that it was probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of $12 million to $24 million. As of fiscal year end 2013,
we concluded that the best estimate within this range is $13 million, of which $3 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $10 million is included in other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position,
or cash flows.

14. Financial Instruments

We use derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, investment, and commodity risks.

Foreign Exchange Risks

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize foreign currency forward and swap contracts,
a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
intercompany and other cash transactions.

We
expect that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the cash flow hedge-designated instruments addressing foreign exchange risks
will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the next twelve months.

Interest Rate and Investment Risk Management

We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To
manage the interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. We use forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into
interest rate swaps ("swaptions") to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt. We also utilize investment swaps to manage earnings exposure on
certain non-qualified deferred compensation liabilities.

During
fiscal 2012, in conjunction with the issuance of the 1.60% senior notes due 2015 and 3.50% senior notes due 2022, we terminated forward starting interest rate swaps and swaptions
designated as cash flow hedges on notional amounts of $400 million originated in fiscal 2010, for a cash payment of



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Financial Instruments (Continued)

$24 million.
The effective portion of the forward starting interest rate swaps, a loss of approximately $24 million, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is being
reclassified to interest expense through January 2016. The ineffective portion of the forward starting interest rate swaps and the remaining unamortized premium of the swaptions were insignificant and
were recorded in interest expense during fiscal 2012. Also during fiscal 2012 and in conjunction with the issuance of the 3.50% senior notes due 2022, we entered into, and subsequently terminated, an
interest rate swap
designated as a cash flow hedge on a notional amount of $300 million for a cash payment of $2 million. That cash payment was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is
being reclassified to interest expense through January 2022.

During
fiscal 2011, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on $150 million principal amount of the 4.875% senior notes due 2021. The maturity dates of
the interest rate swaps coincide with the maturity date of the notes. Under these contracts, we receive fixed amounts of interest applicable to the underlying notes and pay a floating amount based
upon the three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR.

We
utilize swaps to manage exposure related to certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation liabilities. The notional amount of the swaps was $38 million and
$30 million at September 27, 2013 and September 28, 2012, respectively. The swaps act as economic hedges of changes in a portion of the liabilities. The change in value of both
the swap contracts and the non-qualified deferred compensation liabilities are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Hedges of Net Investment

We hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany non-derivative financial instruments denominated in the
same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $2,374 million and $2,981 million at September 27, 2013 and September 28, 2012, respectively. We
reclassified foreign exchange losses of $18 million, gains of $21 million, and losses of $70 million in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. These amounts were recorded as
currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses attributable to the translation of the net investment. See Note 21 for
additional information.

Commodity Hedges

As part of managing the exposure to certain commodity price fluctuations, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow
hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in prices of commodities used in production.

At
September 27, 2013 and September 28, 2012, our commodity hedges had notional values of $278 million and $246 million, respectively. We expect that
significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the commodity hedges will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the next
twelve months.

As
of fiscal year end 2013 and 2012, there were no outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. During fiscal 2012, we terminated forward
starting interest rate swaps and swaptions designated as cash flow hedges. Prior to the termination, the forward starting interest rate swaps generated losses of $3 million and
$9 million in other comprehensive income related to the effective portions of the hedges during fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Also during fiscal 2012, we entered into and terminated an
interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge, recording a loss of $2 million in other comprehensive income. The forward starting interest rate swaps, subsequent to termination, and
certain forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges that were terminated in September 2007 resulted in losses of $9 million, $10 million, and $5 million
reflected in interest expense in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Swaptions terminated in fiscal 2012 resulted in losses of $1 million in interest expense in fiscal 2011 as a result
of amounts excluded from the hedging relationship; losses in fiscal 2012 were insignificant.

During fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, we incurred losses of $11 million, losses of $33 million, and gains of $7 million,
respectively, as a result of marking foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to fair value. The impacts of these derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, which
included losses of $20 million incurred in anticipation of the acquisition of Deutsch during fiscal 2012, were offset by gains or losses realized as a result of re-measuring underlying assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to primarily the Euro or U.S. Dollar. The losses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Deutsch were offset by gains realized as a result of
re-measuring certain non-U.S. Dollar-denominated intercompany non-derivative financial instruments to the U.S. Dollar.

The majority of the derivatives that we enter into are valued using over-the-counter quoted market prices for similar instruments. We do not
believe that the fair values of these derivative instruments differ materially from the amounts that would be realized upon settlement or maturity.

Unrecognized actuarial gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2013 is
principally the result of improved discount rates. Unrecognized actuarial gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2013 are
principally the result of improved asset performance and the effects of currency translation. Unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for non-U.S. defined
benefit pension plans in fiscal 2012 are principally the result of declining discount rates. Amortization of prior service credit is included in other in the above table summarizing the components of
net periodic pension benefit cost.

The
estimated amortization of actuarial losses from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension benefit cost for U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in
fiscal 2014 is expected to be $25 million and $24 million, respectively. The estimated amortization of prior service credit from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic
pension benefit cost for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2014 is expected to be $5 million.

In
determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations.

The
investment strategy for the U.S. pension plans is governed by our investment committee; investment strategies for non-U.S. pension plans are governed locally. Our investment strategy
for our pension plans is to manage the plans on a going concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the
purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. Projected returns are based primarily on pro forma asset allocation, expected long-term returns, and forward-looking estimates of active
portfolio and investment management.

During
fiscal 2012, our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. plans' master trust from a previous target of 30% equity and 70% fixed
income to 10% equity and 90% fixed income in an effort to better protect the funded status of the U.S. plans' master trust. Asset reallocation will continue over a multi-year period based on the
funded status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the "Pension Act Funded Status"), of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions. We expect to reach our target allocation when
the Pension Act Funded Status exceeds 100%. Based on the Pension Act Funded Status as of September 27, 2013, our target asset allocation is 45% equity and 55% fixed income.

Our common shares are not a direct investment of our pension funds; however, the pension funds may indirectly include our shares. The aggregate
amount of our common shares would not be considered material relative to the total pension fund assets.

Our
funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which we operate as well as to make discretionary voluntary contributions
from time to
time. We anticipate that, at a minimum, we will make the minimum required contributions to our pension plans in fiscal 2014 of $3 million to U.S. plans and $84 million to non-U.S. plans.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

We maintain several defined contribution retirement plans, the most significant of which is located in the U.S. These plans include
401(k) matching programs, as well as
qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants' compensation and was
$61 million, $61 million, and $65 million for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans and Rabbi Trusts

We maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A
record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds correspond to a
number of funds in our 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Total deferred compensation liabilities were $99 million and
$83 million at fiscal year end 2013 and 2012, respectively. See Note 14 for additional information regarding our risk management strategy related to deferred compensation liabilities.

Additionally,
we have established rabbi trusts, related to certain acquired companies, through which the assets may be used to pay non-qualified plan benefits. The trusts primarily hold
bonds and equities. The rabbi trust assets are subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of our insolvency; plan participants are general creditors of ours with respect to these benefits.
The value of the assets held by these trusts, included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $83 million at each of fiscal year end 2013 and 2012. Total liabilities related to
the assets held by the rabbi trust and reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $13 million and $17 million at fiscal year end 2013 and 2012, respectively, and include certain
deferred compensation liabilities (referred to above), split dollar life insurance policy liabilities, and an unfunded pension plan in the U.S. Plan participants are general creditors of ours with
respect to these benefits.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension and 401(k) benefits, we also provide certain health care coverage continuation for qualifying retirees
from the date of retirement to age 65.

Net
periodic postretirement benefit cost was $4 million in fiscal 2013 and $3 million in each of fiscal 2012 and 2011 and consisted primarily of service and interest costs.

Unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains of $6 million and losses of $11 million at fiscal year end 2013 and 2012, respectively, were recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income. Amortization of these balances into net periodic postretirement benefit cost is expected to be insignificant in fiscal 2014.

Our
investment strategy for our postretirement benefit plans is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk. The plan is invested in debt
securities, which are considered level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, and equity securities, which are considered level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, and targets an allocation of 50% in
each category.

We
anticipate that we will make insignificant contributions to our postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2014.

Benefit
payments, which reflect future expected service, as appropriate, are expected to be $3 million annually from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2018 and $13 million in
total from fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023. Health care cost trend assumptions used to determine the postretirement benefit obligation were as follows:

The tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects an income tax benefit of $331 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax
matters for the period 1997 through 2000. In addition, the tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects $23 million of net tax benefits primarily consisting of income tax benefits recognized in
connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with certain ADC tax loss carryforwards and income tax benefits recognized in connection with the lapse of statutes of
limitations for examinations of prior year income tax returns, partially offset by income tax expense related to adjustments to prior year income tax returns.

We
assessed the realization of ADC's tax loss and credit carryforwards that we acquired in connection with our purchase of ADC, and we believe it is more likely than not that a tax
benefit will be realized on additional U.S. federal and state net operating losses. Based upon the fiscal years 2011 through 2013 U.S. operating results of the ADC business under our management, we
reduced the valuation allowance provided at the date of acquisition and recorded a tax benefit of $63 million. As of fiscal year end 2013, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of
$177 million related to U.S. federal and state ADC tax attributes due to the uncertainty of their realization in the future.

The
tax provision for fiscal 2012 reflects an income tax benefit of $107 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss
carryforwards in certain non-U.S. locations. In addition, the tax provision for fiscal 2012 reflects $17 million of income tax expense associated with certain non-U.S. tax rate changes enacted
in the quarter ended December 30, 2011.

The
tax provision for fiscal 2011 reflects income tax benefits of $35 million associated with the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain U.S. tax matters.

Unrecognized income tax benefits decreased primarily due to the effective settlement of the IRS's audit of all tax matters for the period 1997
through 2000, excluding the disputed issue involving the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. See Note 13 for additional information regarding the effective settlement.
Pension and postretirement benefits decreased primarily due to a reduction in the pension obligation. See Note 16 for additional information regarding the retirement plans.

At
fiscal year end 2013, we had approximately $1,597 million of U.S. federal and $124 million of U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected) which will
expire in future years through 2033. In addition, at fiscal year end 2013, we had approximately $171 million of U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, of which $46 million have no
expiration and $125 million will expire in future years
through 2033, and $37 million of U.S. state tax credits carryforwards which will expire in future years through 2028.

At
fiscal year end 2013, we had approximately $1,461 million of net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected) in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, of which $1,300 million
have no expiration and $161 million will expire in future years through 2033. Also, at fiscal year end 2013, there were $1 million of non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards which have no
expiration. In addition, $40 million of non-U.S. capital loss carryforwards (tax effected) have no expiration.

17. Income Taxes (Continued)

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,816 million and $1,719 million at fiscal year end 2013 and 2012, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty
of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable
income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions
of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of
deferred tax assets will not be realized. At fiscal year end 2013, approximately $79 million of the valuation allowance relates to share-based compensation and will be recorded to equity if
certain net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are utilized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our
operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of
whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as
such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may
change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax
liabilities and related interest. Furthermore, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current
estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more
than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized.

We
have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in the
future. No additional provision has been made for Swiss or non-Swiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences
related to basis
differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional
tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 27, 2013, certain subsidiaries had approximately $18 billion of cumulative undistributed
earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and research and
development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are
ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. As of
September 27, 2013, we had approximately $4.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to
TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We
estimate that up to approximately $1.5 billion of tax expense would be recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change.
Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and

Uncertain Tax Position Provisions of ASC 740

As of September 27, 2013, we had total unrecognized income tax benefits of $1,620 million. If recognized in future
periods, $1,471 million of these currently unrecognized income tax benefits would impact the income tax provision and effective tax rate. As of September 28, 2012, we had total
unrecognized income tax benefits of $1,795 million. If recognized in future periods, $1,714 million of these unrecognized income tax benefits would impact the income tax provision and
effective tax rate. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized income tax benefits:

We record accrued interest as well as penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes. As of
September 27, 2013, we had recorded $1,018 million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of which $1,015 million
was recorded in income taxes and $3 million was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities. As of September 28, 2012, the balance of accrued interest and penalties was
$1,335 million of which $1,299 million was recorded in income taxes and $36 million was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities. The decrease in the accrued interest and
penalties from fiscal year end 2012 is due mainly to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000. During fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, we recognized a
benefit of $247 million, expense of $95 million, and expense of $86 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

For
tax years 1997 through 2004, Tyco International has resolved all matters, excluding one disputed issue related to the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. The IRS
commenced its audit of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011, and it is our understanding that fieldwork for this audit period is expected to be
completed in fiscal 2014. Also, during fiscal 2012, the IRS commenced its audit of our income tax returns for the years 2008 through 2010. We expect fieldwork for the 2008 through 2010 audit to
conclude in fiscal 2014. See Note 13 for additional information regarding the status of IRS examinations.

In most jurisdictions, taxing authorities retain the ability to review prior tax years and to adjust any net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards from these years that are utilized in a subsequent period.

Although
it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that up to approximately $190 million of unrecognized income tax benefits,
excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months.

We
are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
September 27, 2013.

13 million for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

20. Equity

Common Shares

We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of
association, and our Swiss organizational regulations. Accordingly, the par value of our common shares is stated in Swiss Francs ("CHF"). We continue to use the U.S. Dollar, however, as our reporting
currency on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Subject
to certain conditions specified in our articles of association, we are authorized to increase our share capital by issuing new shares in aggregate not exceeding 50% of our
authorized shares. In March 2013, our shareholders reapproved and extended through March 6, 2015 our board of directors' authorization to issue additional new shares, subject to certain
conditions specified in the articles, in aggregate not exceeding 50% of the amount of our authorized shares.

Common Shares Held in Treasury

At September 27, 2013, approximately 17 million common shares were held in treasury, of which 8 million were owned
by one of our subsidiaries. At September 28, 2012, approximately 16 million common shares were held in treasury, of which 11 million were owned by one of our subsidiaries. Shares
held both directly by us and by our subsidiary are presented as treasury shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

December 28, 2012. The capital reduction by cancellation of shares was subject to a notice period and filing with the commercial register and became effective in May 2013.

In
March 2012, our shareholders approved the cancellation of 24 million shares repurchased under our share repurchase program during the period from December 25, 2010 to
December 30, 2011. The capital reduction by cancellation of shares was subject to a notice period and filing with the commercial register and became effective in May 2012.

In
March 2011, our shareholders approved the cancellation of 5 million shares repurchased under our share repurchase program during the period from July 27, 2010 to
December 24, 2010. The capital reduction by cancellation of shares was subject to a notice period and filing with the commercial register and became effective in May 2011.

Contributed Surplus

Contributed surplus established for Swiss tax and statutory purposes ("Swiss Contributed Surplus"), subject to certain conditions, is a
freely distributable reserve. Distributions to shareholders from Swiss Contributed Surplus are free from withholding tax. As of September 27, 2013 and September 28, 2012, Swiss
Contributed Surplus was CHF 9,342 million and CHF 9,745 million, respectively (equivalent to $8,520 million and $8,940 million, respectively).

Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders

Under Swiss law, subject to certain conditions, distributions to shareholders made in the form of a reduction of registered share
capital or from reserves from capital contributions (equivalent to Swiss Contributed Surplus) are exempt from Swiss withholding tax. See "Contributed Surplus" for additional information regarding our
ability to make distributions free from
withholding tax from contributed surplus. Distributions or dividends on our shares must be approved by our shareholders.

In
March 2010, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.72 (equivalent to
$0.64) per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.16 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 through the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We paid the third and fourth
installments of the distribution during the quarters ended December 24, 2010 and March 25, 2011, respectively. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from
CHF 1.73 (equivalent to $1.60) to CHF 1.37 (equivalent to $1.28).

In
March 2011, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 0.68 (equivalent to $0.72) per share out of contributed surplus, payable in four equal quarterly
installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 through the second quarter of fiscal 2012. We paid the installments of the dividend at a rate of $0.18 per share during each of the quarters
ended June 24, 2011, September 30, 2011, December 30, 2011, and March 30, 2012.

In
March 2012, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.80 (equivalent to
$0.84) per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 through the second quarter of fiscal 2013. We paid the installments of the distribution at
a rate of $0.21 per share

during
each of the quarters ended June 29, 2012, September 28, 2012, December 28, 2012 and March 29, 2013. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common
shares from CHF 1.37 (equivalent to $1.28) to CHF 0.57 (equivalent to $0.44).

In
March 2013, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 0.96 (equivalent to $1.00) per share out of contributed surplus, payable in four equal quarterly
installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 through the second quarter of fiscal 2014. We paid the first and second installments of the dividend at a rate of $0.25 per share during each
of the quarters ended June 28, 2013 and September 27, 2013.

Upon
approval by the shareholders of a dividend payment or cash distribution in the form of a capital reduction, we record a liability with a corresponding charge to contributed surplus
or common shares. At September 27, 2013 and September 28, 2012, the unpaid portion of the dividends and distributions
recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $206 million and $178 million, respectively.

Share Repurchase Program

During fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, we repurchased approximately 20 million of our common shares for $829 million,
approximately 6 million of our common shares for $194 million, and approximately 25 million of our common shares for $867 million, respectively. At September 27,
2013, we had $478 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. See additional information regarding the share repurchase program in Note 25.

22. Share Plans

Equity awards (primarily restricted share awards, performance share awards, and share options) granted by us are administered by the management development and compensation committee of
our board of directors, which consists exclusively of independent directors. Our plans, of which the TE Connectivity Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, is the primary
plan, provide for the award of annual performance bonuses and long-term performance awards, including share options, restricted and performance units, deferred stock units, and other share-based
awards (collectively, "Awards") and allow for the use of unissued shares or treasury shares to be used to satisfy
such Awards. As of September 27, 2013, our plans provided for a maximum of 67 million shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the plans. A
total of 26 million shares remained available for issuance under our plans as of September 27, 2013.

Share-Based Compensation Expense

Total share-based compensation expense, which was primarily included in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations, was $78 million, $68 million, and $71 million during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. We have recognized a related tax benefit
associated with our share-based compensation arrangements of $24 million, $21 million, and $22 million in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

Restricted Share Awards

Restricted share awards, which are generally in the form of restricted share units, are granted subject to certain restrictions.
Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. All restrictions on an award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies retirement or normal retirement
requirements, all or a portion of the award may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights, but do receive dividend
equivalents. For grants that vest based on certain specified performance criteria, the fair value of the shares or units is expensed over the period of performance, once achievement of criteria is
deemed probable. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted
share awards is determined based on the closing value of our shares on the grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest in increments over a period of four years as determined by the management
development and compensation committee.

As
of September 27, 2013, there was $81 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted share awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over
a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Performance Share Awards

Performance share awards, which are generally in the form of performance share units, are granted with pay-out subject to vesting
requirements and certain performance conditions that are determined at the time of grant. Based on our performance, the pay-out of performance share units can range from 0% to 200% of the number of
units originally granted. Certain employees who receive performance share awards also are granted an opportunity to earn additional performance shares subject to the attainment of additional
performance criteria which are set at the time of grant. Attainment of the performance criteria will result in an additional pay-out of performance share units equal to 100% of the performance share
units paid out under the original performance share award. The grant date fair value of performance share awards is expensed over the period of performance once achievement of the performance criteria
is deemed probable. Recipients of performance share units have no voting rights but do receive dividend equivalents. Performance share awards generally vest after a period of three years as determined
by the management development and compensation committee of the board of directors.

Share Options

Share options are granted to purchase our common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of the common
shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee
satisfies retirement or normal retirement requirements, all or a portion of the award may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Options generally vest and become
exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of four years and expire ten years after the date of grant.

The weighted-average exercise price of share option awards granted during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 were $34.27, $34.49, and $33.86,
respectively.

As
of September 27, 2013, there was $38 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share options granted under our share option plans. The cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

At
acquisition, all share options and stock appreciation right ("SAR") awards related to ADC were converted into share options and SARs related to our common shares. See Note 5
for additional information regarding the conversion of ADC share options and SARs.

Share-Based Compensation Assumptions

The grant-date fair value of each share option grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Use of a
valuation model requires management to
make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the stock of a composite of our peers and implied
volatility derived from exchange traded options on that same composite of peers. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and
post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term that approximated the expected life assumed at the date of
grant. The expected annual dividend per share was based on our expected dividend rate. The recognized share-based compensation expense was net of estimated forfeitures, which are based on voluntary
termination behavior as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $69 million, $31 million, and
$50 million, respectively. The total fair value of restricted share awards that vested during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $51 million, $42 million, and $54 million,
respectively. We received cash related to the exercise of options of $214 million, $60 million, and $80 million in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The related excess
cash tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 was not material.

23. Segment and Geographic Data

Effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we reorganized our management and segments to better align the organization around our strategy. We now operate through four reporting
segments: Transportation Solutions, Network Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Consumer Solutions. See Note 1 for a description of the segments in which we operate. We aggregate our operating
segments into reportable segments based upon similar economic characteristics and business groupings of products, services, and customers.

Segment
performance is evaluated based on net sales and operating income. Generally, we consider all expenses to be of an operating nature, and, accordingly, allocate them to each
reportable segment. Costs specific to a segment are charged to the segment. Corporate expenses, such as headquarters administrative costs, are allocated to the segments based on segment operating
income. Intersegment sales were not material and were recorded at selling prices that approximate market prices. Corporate assets are allocated to the segments based on segment assets.

The
following segment information reflects our current segment reporting structure. Prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current segment reporting structure.
