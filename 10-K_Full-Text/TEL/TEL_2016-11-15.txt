Customers

As an industry leader, we have established close working relationships with many of our customers. These relationships allow us to better
anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we are able to
identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products.

Our
approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and
engineering support. We believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate, our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when
addressing the needs of our global customers.

We
manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships
with them typically date back many years. We believe that this diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to
individual end markets, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results
and distinguishes us from our competitors.

There
is no single customer that accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015, or 2014.



Sales and Distribution

We maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate. Our net sales by geographic region

sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale.

(2)

The
Americas region includes our subsea communications business.

See
Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional geographic information relating to our business.

We
sell our products into approximately 150 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers. We also sell some of our products indirectly via third-party
distributors. In fiscal 2016, our direct sales represented 80% of total net sales.

We
maintain distribution centers around the world. Our global coverage positions us near our customers' locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and
lowering their production costs. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile.

Products
are generally delivered to distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, however, product is delivered
directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products via road, rail, sea, and air.

Seasonality and Backlog

We experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically the strongest quarters of
our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by winter holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets.

Certain
of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales into the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production
may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales into the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases.



Customer
orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business conditions and cancellation of unfilled orders prior to shipment of goods. Backlog by reportable segment
was as follows:

We
expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2016 will be filled during fiscal 2017.

Competition

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational
corporations to local manufacturers. Competition is generally on the basis of breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, and service. Our markets have generally been
growing but with downward pressure on prices.

Raw Materials

We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for
molding; precious metals such as gold and silver for plating; and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used for cable and
component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw
materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand.

Research and Development

We are engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness, ease
of use, safety, and reliability of our existing products, and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate. We continually evaluate developing technologies in areas
where we may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition.

Our
research and development expense was as follows:

Our
capital spending and investment in product and process engineering and development enable us to consistently provide innovative, high-quality products with efficient manufacturing
methods. In fiscal 2016, we derived approximately 20% of our net sales from new products, including product extensions, introduced within the previous three fiscal years.



Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing
technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as
available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual
property claims of others.

We
own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents
and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent
protection is obtained. Trademark rights
may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.

While
we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by
any single patent or group of related patents.

Connectivity and TE Connectivity (logo) are trademarks. © 2016 TE Connectivity Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

Management Team and Employees

We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology
leadership. Our chief executive officer, president, and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is
dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry.

Our
strong employee base, along with their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company's success. We continue to emphasize employee development and
training, and we embrace diversity and inclusion.

We
have employees located throughout the world. As of fiscal year end 2016, we employed approximately 75,000 people worldwide, of whom 23,000 were in the Americas region, 28,000 were in
the EMEA region, and 24,000 were in the Asia–Pacific region. Of our total employees, approximately 46,000 were employed in manufacturing.

Government Regulation and Supervision

The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the United States ("U.S.") and other countries. A small portion of our products,
including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and
other events. We have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and
foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.

Environmental

Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials in products, and chemical usage. We are committed to complying with these laws



and
to the protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards; staff dedicated to
environmental, health, and safety issues; periodic compliance auditing; training; and other measures. We also have a program for compliance with the European Union ("EU") Restriction of Hazardous
Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the China Restriction of Hazardous Substances law, the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals
("REACH") Regulation, and similar laws.

Compliance
with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. For example, laws regarding product content and
chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase our costs for energy and certain
materials and products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past
operations. Based upon our experience, current information, and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of $17 million to
$42 million, and that the best estimate within this range is $20 million. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2017 for environmental control facilities
or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.

All periodic and current reports, registration filings, and other filings that we are required to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant
to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") are available free of charge through our internet website at

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks described below
are not the only ones facing us. Our business also is subject to general risks that affect many other companies. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial
may also impair our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Risks Relating to the Macroeconomic Environment and Our Global Presence

Conditions in global or regional economies, capital and money markets, and banking systems, and cyclical
industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally, including the cost
and availability of consumer and business credit, end demand from consumer and industrial markets, and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign
debt and significant bank failures or defaults, any of which could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash
flow, and ability to obtain financing. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a
timely fashion or in full. Further, our vendors may experience similar problems, which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels. If regional or global
economic conditions deteriorate, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Also,



deterioration
in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other long-lived assets. Impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of
operations and financial position.

Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results.

A significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S., and changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant
effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We
are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue. Approximately 54% of our net sales for fiscal 2016 were invoiced in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar, and we expect non-U.S. dollar revenue to represent a significant and likely increased portion of our future net revenue. We have elected not to hedge this foreign currency
exposure. Therefore, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the euro or Asian currencies, our U.S. dollar reported revenue
and income will decrease.

We
manage certain cash, intercompany, and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by
the counterparty to these contracts, our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful.

We could suffer significant business interruptions.

Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers, and the supply chains that support their operations, may be vulnerable to interruption
by natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, or floods; or other disasters such as fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war, disease, or failures of management information or other
systems due to internal or external causes. If a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events, our business, results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

We could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans' investment portfolios
or a reduction in returns on plan assets.

Concerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with concerns about credit, inflation, or deflation, have caused and could continue
to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities, including fixed income and equity securities, which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans' investment
portfolios. In addition, the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved. A decrease in the value of our pension plans' investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could
have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient
funding.

The global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted, which has reduced the availability of investment
capital and credit. Recent downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital. As a result, we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate
and grow our business. Our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures. The extent of any
impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity, the cost of
financing, and other general economic and business conditions.



We are subject to global risks of political, economic, and military instability.

Our workforce; manufacturing, research, administrative, and sales facilities; markets; customers; and suppliers are located throughout the
world. As a result, we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including:

•

tariffs, trade barriers, and trade disputes;

•

regulations related to customs and import/export matters;

•

variations in lengths of payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable;

•

tax law and regulatory changes in the U.S. and EU among other jurisdictions, including tax law and regulatory changes that may be effected as a
result of tax policy recommendations from quasi-governmental organizations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD"), examinations by taxing authorities, variations
in tax laws from country to country, changes to the terms of income tax treaties, and difficulties in the tax-efficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions;

•

employment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which we
currently operate;

•

difficulties protecting intellectual property;

•

instability in economic or political conditions, including sovereign debt levels, Eurozone uncertainty, inflation, recession, actual or
anticipated military or political conflicts, and any impact as a result of the proposed exit of the United Kingdom from the EU; and

•

the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements.

We
have sizeable operations in China, including 15 manufacturing sites. In addition, approximately 17% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 were made to customers in China. Economic
conditions in China have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain. In addition, the legal system in China is still developing and subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders
for products in China could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions or interpretation of Chinese law.

In
addition, any downgrade by rating agencies of long-term U.S. sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets
and economic conditions, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and liquidity.

Risks Relating to the Industry in Which We Operate

We are dependent on the automotive and other industries.

We are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products, and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand
in these markets. Periodic downturns in our customers' industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

Approximately
40% of our net sales for fiscal 2016 were to customers in the automotive industry. The automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant
price pressure on their suppliers. Additionally, the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit
conditions. As a supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global
or regional economic and credit conditions and changes in the operations, products, business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automotive manufacturers, as
well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers.



During
fiscal 2016, approximately 12% of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market, 9% of our net sales were to customers in the aerospace, defense, oil, and
gas end market, and 8% of our net sales were to customers in the data and devices end market. Demand for industrial equipment is dependent upon economic conditions, including customer investment in
intelligent buildings, factory automation, and process control systems, as well as market conditions in the medical, rail transportation, solar and lighting, and other major industrial markets we
serve. The aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand, depending on worldwide economic and political conditions. Demand in the oil and gas market is impacted by
oil price volatility. The data and devices industry can experience variability in demand depending on the underlying business and consumer demand for computer and consumer electronics products.

We encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry.

We operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components, and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the
future. Our overall competitive position
depends on a number of factors including the price, quality, and performance of our products; the level of customer service; the development of new technology; our ability to participate in emerging
markets; and customers' expectations relating to socially responsible operations. The competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large, diversified
manufacturers to small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years, and our major competitors have
significant financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price, and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain
products. We cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors. Increased competition
may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future
revenue.

Substantially all of the markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences, which
are rapid in certain end markets. Our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design, develop, introduce, and sell new and innovative products; to modify existing
products; and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change. There are numerous risks inherent in these processes, including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate
the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands.

Like other suppliers to the electronics industry, we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices.

We have historically experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, continuing pressure to lower our prices. In recent years, we have
experienced price erosion averaging from 1% to 2% each year. In order to maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot provide assurance that continuing
pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate.

Many of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become more
concentrated in recent years, including the automotive, data and devices, and aerospace and defense industries. Consolidation of customers may lead to decreased



product
purchases from us. In addition, as our customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources
from which to purchase. Our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends may adversely affect the margins on our products, particularly for
commodity components.

The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short.

The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle. As a result, the resources devoted to product
sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering expenses
and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover, and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could
be materially and adversely affected.

Risks Relating to Our Operations

Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.

We are a large buyer of resin, copper, gold, silver, brass, steel, chemicals and additives, zinc, and other precious metals. Many of these raw
materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, the price of many of these raw materials, including gold
and copper, continues to fluctuate. If we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw
materials, it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials. To the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our
customers, our margins may decline, materially affecting our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In addition, we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain
commodities prices. The success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials. We could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses
if these forecasts are inaccurate.

In
accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin,
tantalum, tungsten, or gold ("conflict minerals" or "3TG") mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo ("DRC") and adjoining countries (together with the DRC, the "Covered Countries") in their
products. These requirements could affect the sourcing, pricing, and availability of 3TG used in the manufacture of certain of our products. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers
who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3TG from the Covered Countries, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain non-conflict 3TG in sufficient quantities or at
competitive prices. Further, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins and
chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures.

We may use components and products manufactured by third parties.

We may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture
certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if
there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. If these third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have
difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged.



Our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain executive management
employees and limitations affecting retention and hiring, including Swiss regulations, could have a negative impact on our business and increase our expenses.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our executive management employees and hire new executive
management employees to replace, succeed, or add to members of our executive management team. Our executive management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace.
Competition for executive talent is intense, and we compete for these personnel with other companies that are regulated by the laws of jurisdictions that provide significantly greater flexibility than
Switzerland, our jurisdiction of incorporation, in compensation practices for executive management employees.

Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our
operations, compromise confidential information, and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation.

Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations; compromise information
belonging to us, our employees, customers, and suppliers; and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the normal course of business, we rely on information
technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and
activities. Additionally, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information and customer and employee data, and may have access to confidential or personal information in
certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training,
monitoring of networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be
vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems
failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage
to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks
and infrastructure, to date none of these threats has had a material impact on our business or operations.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the
ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens. Our outstanding notes' indentures
contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability to consolidate, merge, and sell assets.

Although
none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our continued ability to meet the Credit Facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our
control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility or indentures. Upon the
occurrence of certain defaults under our Credit Facility and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our
lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our Credit Facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have
sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding



under
our Credit Facility and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material
debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder.

The
indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or
access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of
a change of control triggering event.

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely.

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including:

•

our quarterly or annual earnings;

•

changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide;

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global and regional economic conditions and investors' concerns about
potential risks to future economic growth;

•

changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;

•

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; and

•

the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business.

Risks Relating to Strategic Transactions

Future acquisitions may not be successful.

We regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses, product lines, or technologies which have the potential to strengthen
our market position or enhance our existing product offerings. We cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future. We
also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business,
our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity.

If we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash, the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks, public
offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other
leverage measures. We cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to make an acquisition partially or
wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares.



Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures. Any divestitures may
result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel; the diversion of management's attention from other business
concerns; the disruption of our business; and the potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered.

Risks Relating to Intellectual Property, Litigation, and Regulations

Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our
products and technology.

The electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry, companies
have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity
of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the importance of the technology, product, patent, trademark,
or trade secret in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

In the normal course of business, we are, from time to time, a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of
intellectual property rights, anti-competitive behavior, product liability, breach of contract, and employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and antitrust laws permit
successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we
may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows.

If any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable
trade regulations, our business may suffer.

Our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the
U.S. and the EU. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other
markets are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We may also be subject to third-party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe these
antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements,
whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could
limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash
flows.



We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom's
Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom's Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies
and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We
operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs
and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts
committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, government
enforcement actions, and reputational risk.

We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various
countries where we operate and where our products are sold. These laws and regulations govern, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment;

•

investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites;

•

greenhouse gas emissions;

•

product hazardous material content; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

We
may not have been, or we may not at all times be, in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. If we violate these laws, we could be fined,
criminally charged, or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal, and remediation of hazardous substances
or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigation, removal, and remediation costs under certain federal and state laws
is retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of,
or exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other environmental agencies that conditions at a number of currently and
formerly-owned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the
government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites. We also have independently investigated various sites and determined
that further investigation and/or remediation is necessary.

While
we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future
environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect
our



results
of operations, financial position, and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury, property damage, and/or cleanup in the future based on
our past, present, or future business activities.

Our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, and
recycling.

The EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and
other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These
laws include the EU
Restriction of Hazardous Substances, End of Life Vehicle, and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives; the EU REACH Regulation; the China law on Management Methods for Controlling
Pollution by Electronic Information Products; and various other laws. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety
of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. These laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions
to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability
to sell our products in certain jurisdictions.

Risks Relating to Our Swiss Jurisdiction of Incorporation

As a Swiss corporation, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management
involving the issuance of shares.

As a Swiss corporation, our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our
standalone unconsolidated Swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements. In addition, our articles of association allow us to create authorized
share capital that can be issued by the board of directors, but this authorization is limited to (i) authorized share capital up to 50% of the existing registered shares with such authorization
valid for a maximum of two years, which authorization period ends on March 2, 2018, approved by our shareholders at our March 2, 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, and
(ii) conditional share capital of up to 50% of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants
preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new
issuances of shares from conditional share capital. Swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares, and reserves for approval by
shareholders many types of corporate actions, including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation, dividends, and/or voting. Moreover, under Swiss law, we generally
may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares. Any such actions for which our shareholders must
vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders, which would delay the timing to execute such actions. Such limitations provide
the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management. While we do not believe that Swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse
effect on us, we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital
management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors.



We might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding
tax.

In order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of Swiss withholding tax, we anticipate making distributions to shareholders
through a reduction of contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) or registered share capital. Various tax law and corporate law proposals in Switzerland, if passed in
the future, may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements
for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital, or that Swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the
future. In addition, over the long term, the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited. Our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from
Swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to do
so could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc may limit the amount available for any
future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.

Under Swiss corporate law, which applies to us, the registered share capital in our unconsolidated Swiss statutory financial statements is
required to be denominated in Swiss francs. Since distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in U.S. dollars,
shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the Swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital. If the U.S. dollar were to increase in value relative
to the Swiss franc, the U.S. dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without Swiss withholding tax will decrease.

We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares.

The Swiss Code of Obligations regulates a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only
repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. The aggregate par value
of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, only if
our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased
shares are dedicated for cancellation. Additionally, various tax law and corporate law proposals in Switzerland, if passed in the future, may affect our ability to repurchase our shares. Our ability
to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to
repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at
shareholder meetings.

Our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by Swiss law for Swiss companies like us that issue
registered shares (as opposed to bearer shares). This provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights, holders of our shares must be registered in our share register (Aktienbuch) as
shareholders with voting rights. Only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders' meetings, but all
shareholders will be entitled to dividends, distributions, preemptive rights, advance subscription rights, and liquidation proceeds. The board of directors may, in its discretion, refuse to



register
shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association. Additionally, various proposals in
Switzerland for corporate law changes, if passed in the future, may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through
brokerages and banks. Such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition
proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable.

Our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered "anti-takeover" provisions because they would make it harder for a third
party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions, among others:

•

shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent, and

•

restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15% or more of our issued voting
shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors.

These
provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of our issued voting shares, which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or
delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price, or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders. Our articles of association also
contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital (in either case, representing a maximum of 50% of the shares presently registered in the
commercial register and in case of issuances from authorized capital, until March 2, 2018 unless re-authorized by shareholders for a subsequent two-year period) without shareholder approval and
without regard for shareholders' preemptive rights or advance subscription rights, for the purpose of the defense of an actual, threatened, or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in relation to which
the board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial advisor, has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. We note that Swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a
takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under Swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect
to conditional share capital. In addition, the NYSE, on which our shares are listed, requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20% or more of the outstanding shares or voting
power, with limited exceptions.

Legislative and regulatory actions and proposals in Switzerland, the U.S., and other jurisdictions could
cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate.

Various U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lower tax
jurisdictions. There has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives, such as:

•

the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's initiative to develop agreed-upon best practices to prevent base erosion and
profit shifting, which contemplate changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to the distribution of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions,

•

corporate tax reform in Switzerland, which is proposed in response to OECD and EU concerns,

•

EU and other country efforts to adopt certain OECD proposals and modified OECD proposals (including the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, state aid
cases, and various transparency proposals), and



•

tax policy in the U.S., such as the recently issued final and temporary debt/equity regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 385,
revisions to the model income tax treaty, and other international tax reform proposals.

If
these proposals are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business, they could, among other things, cause double taxation, increase audit risk, and materially increase our
worldwide corporate effective tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives, and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will
not apply to us.

Legislation in the U.S. could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business
by denying government contracts to U.S. companies that have moved to lower-tax jurisdictions.

We
expect the U.S. Congress to continue to consider implementation and/or expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that
have corporate locations abroad. We cannot predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under
any future legislative enactments, the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business, or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Therefore, we cannot
provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us. In addition, we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our
indirect sales to U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of our non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the
potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us.

Swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our
securities.

As we are organized under the laws of Switzerland, it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in
Switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland would recognize or
enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or
those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as they
are contrary to that nation's public policy.

Swiss
corporate law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the manner in which
directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification available to directors
and officers. Thus, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.



ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our principal executive office is located in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. As of fiscal year end 2016, we owned approximately 19 million
square feet and leased approximately 10 million square feet of manufacturing, warehousing, and office space. We believe our facilities are suitable for the conduct of our business and adequate
for our current needs.

We
manufacture our products in approximately 25 countries worldwide. Our manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of the manufacturing processes, including our primary processes of
stamping, plating, molding, extrusion, beaming, and assembly. We consider the productive capacity of our manufacturing facilities sufficient. As of fiscal year end 2016, our principal centers of

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including product liability matters, employment
disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real
estate tax, and transfer tax. In addition, we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the normal
course of business, we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third party's patent were to be determined against us, we might
be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products. If a patent owned by or
licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable, we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which
could be significant in amount.

Management
believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these
proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position,
or cash flows.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated
Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and
beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors
discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Our
Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").

The
following discussion includes organic net sales growth and free cash flow which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, together with GAAP
financial measures, provide useful information to investors because they reflect the financial measures that management uses in evaluating the underlying results of our operations. See "Non-GAAP
Financial Measures" for more information about these non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including the measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the
measures.

Overview

We are a global technology leader. We design and manufacture connectivity and sensor solutions that are essential in today's increasingly
connected world. We help our customers solve the need for intelligent, efficient, and high-performing products and solutions.

Fiscal
2016 highlights included the following:

•

Overall, our net sales were flat in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, as increased net sales in the Transportation Solutions and
Industrial Solutions segments were offset by declines in the Communications Solutions segment. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by $254 million in fiscal 2016 as
compared to fiscal 2015. On an organic basis, our net sales increased 1.5% during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.

•

Our net sales by segment were as follows:

•

Transportation Solutions

—Our net sales increased 2.4% due to increased
sales in the automotive end market and, to a lesser degree, the sensors and commercial transportation end markets.

•

Industrial Solutions

—Our net sales increased 1.1% due to increased
sales in the industrial equipment end market which benefitted from sales contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by decreased sales in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas and the energy end
markets.

•

Communications Solutions

—Our net sales decreased 6.8% due primarily to
sales declines in the data and devices end market, partially offset by sales increases in the subsea communications end market.

•

Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $238 million in net sales and $0.13 per share to diluted earnings per
share.

•

During fiscal 2016, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $1.48 per issued share payable in four quarterly
installments of $0.37 beginning with the third fiscal quarter of 2016 and ending in the second fiscal quarter of 2017.



•

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2,019 million and free cash flow was $1,585 million in fiscal 2016.

•

During fiscal 2016, we acquired the Creganna Medical group ("Creganna"), a global leader in the design and manufacture of minimally invasive
delivery and access medical devices. Also during fiscal 2016, we completed the divestiture our CPD business.

Outlook

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect net sales to be between $2.95 billion and $3.05 billion. This reflects sales growth
in the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments, partially offset by sales declines in the Communications Solutions segment relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Additional
information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2016 is as follows:

•

Transportation Solutions

—We expect our net sales growth in the automotive end
market to exceed anticipated growth in global automotive production of approximately 2% due primarily to growth in China and the EMEA region. We also expect our net sales to increase in the commercial
transportation and sensors end markets.

•

Industrial Solutions

—We expect our net sales to increase in the industrial
equipment end market due primarily to recent acquisitions. We expect our net sales growth in the aerospace and defense market to be partially offset by market weakness and sales declines in the oil
and gas market.

•

Communications Solutions

—We expect our net sales to decline in the data and devices
end market primarily as a result of the divestiture of our CPD business. This decline is expected to be partially offset by sales growth in the appliances and subsea communications end markets.

We
expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

For
fiscal 2017, we expect net sales to be between $12.3 billion and $12.9 billion, an increase from $12.2 billion in fiscal 2016 which included an additional week.
This increase is attributable to sales growth in the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments, partially offset by sales declines in the Communications Solutions segment. Additional
information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 is as follows:

•

Transportation Solutions

—We expect our net sales increase in the automotive end
market to outpace expected growth in global automotive production of approximately 1% as a result of increased content per vehicle and market share gains. We also expect our net sales to increase in
the commercial transportation and sensors end markets.

•

Industrial Solutions

—We expect our net sales to increase in the industrial
equipment end market due primarily to recent acquisitions. Also, we expect net sales growth in the aerospace and defense market.

•

Communications Solutions

—We expect our net sales growth in the subsea
communications and appliances end markets to be more than offset by sales declines in the data and devices end market, due primarily to the divestiture of our CPD business.

We
expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.84 to $4.14 per share in fiscal 2017.

The
above outlook is based on foreign exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.



We
are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment, including the proposed exit of the United Kingdom from the EU, and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we
serve. We continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have
sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. See further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

Acquisitions

During fiscal 2016, we acquired four businesses, including Creganna, for a combined cash purchase price of $1.3 billion, net of cash
acquired.

During
fiscal 2015, we acquired Measurement Specialties, a leading global designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensor-based systems. The total value paid was approximately
$1.7 billion, net of cash acquired, and included $225 million for the repayment of Measurement Specialties' debt and accrued interest. Also during fiscal 2015, we acquired three
additional businesses for $241 million in cash, net of cash acquired.

During
fiscal 2014, we acquired five businesses, including the SEACON Group ("SEACON"), a leading provider of underwater connector technology and systems, for $522 million in
cash, net of cash acquired.

See
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.

Divestiture

During fiscal 2016, we sold our CPD business for net cash proceeds of $333 million. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $144 million
on the transaction. The CPD business was reported as part of the Data and Devices business within our Communications Solutions segment.

Net
sales were flat in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Organic net sales growth of 1.5% and net sales contributions from acquisitions and a divestiture of 0.6% were offset by the
negative impact of foreign currency translation of 2.1% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies. Organic net sales were adversely affected by price erosion of $188 million in fiscal
2016. Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $238 million in net sales. The impact of the additional week was estimated using an average weekly sales figure for the last
month of the fiscal year.

Net
sales increased $260 million, or 2.2%, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The increase in net sales resulted from sales contributions from acquisitions of 5.9% and
organic net sales growth of 3.8%, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 7.5% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies. During fiscal 2015, Measurement
Specialties contributed net sales of $548 million. Organic net sales were adversely affected by price erosion of $208 million in fiscal 2015.

See
further discussion of net sales below under "Segment Results."

Net Sales by Geographic Region.

Our business operates in three geographic regions—the Americas, EMEA, and
Asia–Pacific—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to
other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. We sell our products into approximately 150 countries,
and approximately 54% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2016. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2016 by major currencies invoiced was as follows:

In
fiscal 2016, gross margin decreased $54 million as compared to fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, gross margin included charges of $10 million from the amortization of
acquisition-related fair value adjustments to acquired inventories and customer order backlog associated primarily with Creganna. In fiscal 2015, gross margin included charges of $36 million
from the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments to acquired inventories and customer order backlog associated primarily with Measurement Specialties. Excluding these charges, the
gross margin decreased in fiscal 2016 due primarily to unfavorable product mix and price erosion, partially offset by lower material costs.

Gross
margin increased $115 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, gross margin included charges of $36 million associated with the acquisition
of Measurement Specialties. Excluding these charges, gross margin increased in fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of higher volume and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by the
negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and price erosion.

Cost
of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices, and the price of many of our raw materials continues to fluctuate. In fiscal 2016, we purchased
approximately



170 million
pounds of copper, 115,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.4 million troy ounces of silver. The following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, and
silver.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

In fiscal 2016, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased
$41 million as compared
to fiscal 2015 due primarily to cost control measures and savings attributable to restructuring actions.

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses decreased $30 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease resulted primarily from cost control measures and
savings attributable to restructuring actions, partially offset by additional expenses associated with Measurement Specialties.

Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses.

Research, development, and engineering expenses increased $17 million in
fiscal 2016 as
compared to fiscal 2015 and $44 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The increases resulted from additional expenses related to acquisitions and growth initiatives, primarily in
the Transportation Solutions segment.

Acquisition and Integration Costs.

In fiscal 2016, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $22 million related
primarily to the
acquisitions of Creganna and Measurement Specialties. In fiscal 2015, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $55 million, related primarily to the acquisitions of Measurement
Specialties and SEACON. In fiscal 2014, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $31 million, primarily in connection with the acquisition of SEACON.

Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.

We are committed to continuous productivity improvements and consistently evaluate
opportunities to simplify
our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness
in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.

During
fiscal 2016, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment.
During fiscal 2015, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions and product line



closures,
primarily impacting the Communications Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments. During fiscal 2014, we initiated a restructuring program associated primarily with headcount reductions
and manufacturing site and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment.

In
connection with these initiatives, we recorded net restructuring charges of $125 million, $93 million, and $23 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014,
respectively. Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately $150 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2017. Cost
savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. During fiscal 2017, we expect net restructuring charges to be similar to fiscal 2016 levels. We
expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $110 million in fiscal 2017.

During
fiscal 2016, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $144 million on the sale of our CPD business.

During
fiscal 2016 and 2015, we incurred net other charges of $21 million and $59 million, respectively, primarily in connection with the divestiture of certain businesses.

See
Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Other Income (Expense), Net.

In fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recorded net other income (expense) primarily pursuant to the
Tax Sharing Agreement
with Tyco International and Covidien. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding net other income (expense) and Note 12 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for information regarding the separation and related Tax Sharing Agreement.

Income Taxes.

See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding items impacting income tax
expense (benefit) for
fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $3,096 million and $3,237 million at fiscal year end 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information regarding the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

As
of fiscal year end 2016, certain subsidiaries had approximately $21 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our
global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding undistributed earnings.

Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes.

During fiscal 2015, we sold our BNS business for $3.0 billion in
cash and recognized
a pre-tax gain of $1.1 billion on the transaction. During fiscal 2016, we recognized an additional pre-tax gain of $29 million on the divestiture, related primarily to pension and net
working capital adjustments.

In
fiscal 2006, the former shareholders of Com-Net initiated a lawsuit related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. In connection with the Com-Net case, we recorded a reserve and
pre-tax charges of $127 million during fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016, we recorded pre-tax credits of $30 million, representing a release of excess reserves. These amounts are reflected
in income from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the Com-Net case was associated with our former Wireless Systems business which was sold in 2009.

The
BNS and Wireless Systems businesses met the discontinued operations criteria and were reported as such in all periods presented on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to
reclassification to discontinued operations, the BNS and Wireless Systems businesses were included in the former
Network Solutions and Wireless Systems segments, respectively. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

In
fiscal 2016, net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $152 million, or 2.4%, from fiscal 2015 due primarily to organic net sales growth of 4.9%, partially
offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 2.7%. Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $130 million in net sales. Our organic net sales by primary
industry end market were as follows:

•

Automotive

—Our organic net sales increased 5.6% in fiscal 2016. The increase was
due primarily to growth of 8.4% in the Asia–Pacific region and 5.9% in the EMEA region, partially offset by a decrease of 0.9% in the Americas region. In the Asia–Pacific
region, our growth was driven by increased electronification and market share gains in China. In the EMEA region, our organic net sales increased due to electronification and new model launches. The
Americas region was adversely impacted by market weakness in North America and macroeconomic conditions in South America.

•

Commercial transportation

—Our organic net sales increased 2.6% in fiscal 2016 due
primarily to growth in the heavy truck market in the EMEA region and China.

•

Sensors

—Our organic net sales increased 3.1% in fiscal 2016 due primarily to
increased sales in the automotive, aerospace and defense, and industrial equipment markets.

Net
sales in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $261 million, or 4.3%, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of sales contributions from acquisitions
of 9.3% and organic net sales growth of 4.1%, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 9.1%.



Measurement
Specialties contributed net sales of $548 million during fiscal 2015. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as
follows:

•

Automotive

—Our organic net sales increased 5.1% in fiscal 2015 with growth of 8.2%
in the Asia–Pacific region, 4.4% in the EMEA region, and 0.8% in the Americas region. Growth in the Asia–Pacific and EMEA regions and North America was driven primarily by
increased content per vehicle. This growth was partially offset by weakness in South America driven by lower production volumes in Brazil.

•

Commercial transportation

—Our organic net sales decreased 0.8% in fiscal 2015 due
to lower demand in the agriculture market across all regions, partially offset by growth in the heavy truck market in developed countries.

•

Sensors

—Our organic net sales increased 1.9% in fiscal 2015 due primarily to
increased sales in the automotive market resulting from new product launches in China and increased volume in Japan, partially offset by market weakness in Korea and Eastern Europe.

Operating
income in the Industrial Solutions segment decreased $9 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Excluding the items presented in the table above, operating
income decreased in fiscal 2016 due primarily to unfavorable product mix and price erosion, partially offset by lower material costs.

In
fiscal 2015, operating income in the Industrial Solutions segment decreased $79 million as compared to fiscal 2014. Excluding the items presented in the table above, operating
income decreased in fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and price erosion.

In
fiscal 2016, net sales in the Communications Solutions segment decreased $183 million, or 6.8%, as compared to fiscal 2015 due to sales declines resulting from a divestiture of
4.6%, organic net sales declines of 1.6%, and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 0.6%. Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $43 million in net sales.
Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows:

•

Data and devices

—Our organic net sales decreased 17.8% in fiscal 2016 as a result
of strategic exit of certain low margin product lines and market weakness in all regions.

•

Subsea communications

—Our organic net sales increased 24.8% in fiscal 2016 due to
increased levels of project activity.

•

Appliances

—Our organic net sales decreased 1.8% in fiscal 2016 due primarily to
high inventory levels at distributors in the first half of the year and lower demand in the Asia–Pacific and Americas regions, partially offset by growth in the EMEA region.

Net
sales in the Communications Solutions segment increased $122 million, or 4.7%, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of organic net sales growth of 8.4%,
partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 3.7%. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows:

•

Data and devices

—Our organic net sales decreased 13.6% in fiscal 2015 due to
continued declines in our sales in the feature phone and tablet computer markets, weak demand in the smartphone business, and the exit of certain low margin product lines.

•

Subsea communications

—Our organic net sales increased 150.5% in fiscal 2015 as a
result of increased levels of project activity.



•

Appliances

—Our organic net sales increased 2.3% in fiscal 2015 with increased
demand in the EMEA region and a rebound in the U.S. market, partially offset by lower demand in the Asia–Pacific region.

Our
ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital
markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these
other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to
our authorized share repurchase program; to acquire strategic businesses or product lines; to pay distributions or dividends



on
our common shares; or to reduce our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law. The cost or availability of future funding may be
impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions.

As
of fiscal year end 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws,
substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE
Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent
company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense. We provide for tax liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to amounts that we
expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations. As of fiscal year end
2016, we had approximately $6.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA and TE
Connectivity Ltd. but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to approximately $1.5 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial
Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are
designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2,019 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to $1,619 million in fiscal
2015. The increase resulted primarily from favorable effects of changes in accounts receivable and inventory levels, partially offset by an increase in net payments related to pre-separation tax
matters.

Net
cash provided by continuing operating activities decreased $185 million to $1,619 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to $1,804 million in fiscal 2014. The
decrease resulted primarily from the unfavorable effects of changes in working capital levels, partially offset by a decrease in net payments related to pre-separation tax matters.

Pension
contributions in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $67 million, $66 million, and $87 million, respectively. We expect pension contributions to be
$54 million in fiscal 2017, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. There were no voluntary pension contributions in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014.

The
amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $806 million, $350 million, and $259 million, respectively. In fiscal 2016
and 2015, these payments included $471 million and $47 million, respectively, for tax deficiencies related to pre-separation tax matters. Also during fiscal 2016 and 2015, we received
net reimbursements of $321 million and $7 million, respectively, from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters. During fiscal
2014, we made net payments of $179 million to Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to our indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information related to pre-separation tax matters.

In
addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. Free cash flow was
$1,585 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to $1,076 million in fiscal 2015 and $1,477 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal
2015 was driven primarily by favorable effects of changes in accounts receivable and inventory levels. The decrease in free cash flow in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was driven primarily by
the changes in net cash provided by continuing operating activities discussed above and higher proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment in fiscal 2014.



The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash
flow.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Capital expenditures were $628 million, $600 million, and $635 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We
expect fiscal 2017 capital spending levels to be approximately 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our
manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.

Proceeds
from the sale of property, plant, and equipment for fiscal 2014 included approximately $100 million related to the sale of real estate.

During
fiscal 2016, we acquired four businesses, including Creganna, for a combined cash purchase price of $1.3 billion, net of cash acquired. During fiscal 2015, we acquired
Measurement Specialties. The total value paid for the transaction was approximately $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired, and included $225 million for the repayment of Measurement
Specialties' debt and accrued interest. Also during fiscal 2015, we acquired three additional businesses for $241 million in cash, net of cash acquired. During fiscal 2014, we acquired five
businesses for $522 million in cash, net of cash acquired. See additional information in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During
fiscal 2016, we received net cash proceeds of $333 million related to the sale of our CPD business. See additional information in Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

During
fiscal 2015, we received net cash proceeds of $3.0 billion related to the sale of our BNS business. See additional information in Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization

Total debt at fiscal year end 2016 and 2015 was $4,070 million and $3,884 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.

During
January 2016, TEGSA, our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 3.700% senior notes due February 15, 2026. The notes are TEGSA's
unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.

TEGSA
has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in December 2015
primarily to extend the maturity date from August 2018 to December 2020. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2016 and 2015.



The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as
defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is
triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of fiscal year end
2016, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.

Periodically,
TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper
program are backed by the Credit Facility.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.

Payments
of common share dividends to shareholders were $509 million, $502 million, and $443 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. See Note 18
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding dividends and cash distributions on our common shares.

Future
dividends on our common shares or reductions of registered share capital for distribution to shareholders, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their
discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends or distributions be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial
condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant.

During
fiscal 2016, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1.0 billion in the share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately 43 million of our common
shares for $2,610 million, 18 million of our common shares for $1,163 million, and 11 million of our common shares for $604 million under the share repurchase
program during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. At fiscal year end 2016, we had $1.1 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.

Purchase
obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services.

of which is uncertain. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits, interest, and penalties.

(5)

The
table above does not reflect pension obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans; however,
we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts
of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $54 million to pension plans in fiscal 2017, before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions
and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(6)

Other
long-term liabilities of $362 million are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items.

Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product
liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value
added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable
law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial
commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2017 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance,
and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks
involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities
and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At
fiscal year end 2016, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $324 million.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results
of operations, financial position, or cash flows.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are
summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following accounting policies are considered to be the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions
that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605,

Revenue
Recognition

. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards
of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. A reserve for
estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies.
A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and also is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Contract
revenues for construction related projects, which are generated in the Communications Solutions segment, are recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method.
Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to
total
estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period
in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first
become determinable.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets
with a determinable life primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, as well as customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1
to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinable-lived intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and
when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation.

We
test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for
which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2016, we had six reporting units, five of which contained goodwill. There were two
reporting units in each of our three segments. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair
values. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure.

Goodwill
impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we
believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting unit-specific factors
including operating results,



business
plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in
applying these factors to the impairment analysis.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In
the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds
the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is
recognized in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been
acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Fair
value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The
income approach generally has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax
rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in
future periods.

We
completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and determined that no impairment existed.

Income Taxes

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the
calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial
statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and non-U.S. pre-tax
operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of
taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in
the appropriate jurisdictions. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred
tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.

Changes
in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.



In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we
conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for
issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest
are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon
the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result
in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other
current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Pension

Our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our plans is recognized
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit
obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the
current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The
benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected
average remaining service lives of current participants.

Two
critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least
annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience.
Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected
future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2016, a
25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $127 million; a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the
present value of our pension obligations by $113 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of
return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would
have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2016 pension expense by $10 million.

The
long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans' master trust is 10% equity and 90% fixed income. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period
based on the funded status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the "Pension Act Funded Status"), of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions. We expect to reach our target
allocation when the Pension Act Funded Status exceeds 105%. Based on the Pension Act Funded Status as of fiscal year end 2016, our target asset allocation is 45% equity and 55% fixed income.



Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued and recently adopted accounting
pronouncements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic net sales growth and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for results in accordance with GAAP.
These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of these measures is that they exclude the financial impact of items that
would otherwise either increase
or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using these non-GAAP measures in combination with the most directly comparable GAAP measures in order to better understand the
amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts. The following provides additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures.

Organic Net Sales Growth

Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our underlying results and trends in the business. It is also a significant component in our
incentive compensation plans. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange
rates, and acquisitions and divestitures, if any. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as
the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. Management uses organic net
sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making
processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in
evaluating operations. The tables presented in "Results of Operations" and "Segment Results" above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities
(the most comparable GAAP measure) and free cash flow consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. We believe free cash flow provides useful
information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations.

Free
cash flow is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items, if any, minus net
capital expenditures. Voluntary pension contributions are excluded because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net
payments related to pre-separation tax matters, are also excluded by management in evaluating free cash flow. Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of
property, plant, and equipment. These items are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments.

In
the calculation of free cash flow, we subtract certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the board of directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is
less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for future discretionary
expenditures, as our



definition
of free cash flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary
dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered in the calculation of free cash flow.

The
tables presented in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under GAAP.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain statements in this Annual Report are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. These statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include, among others, the
information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance
improvements, acquisitions, divestitures, the effects of competition, and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical
facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words "believe," "expect," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue," "may,"
"should," or the negative of these terms or similar expressions.

Forward-looking
statements involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. You should not
put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We do not have any intention or obligation to update forward-looking statements after we file this report except as required by law.

The
following and other risks, which are described in greater detail in "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors," as well as other risks described in this Annual Report, could cause
our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements:

•

conditions in the global or regional economies and global capital markets, and cyclical industry conditions (including as a result of the
impact of the proposed exit of the United Kingdom from the EU);

•

conditions affecting demand for products in the industries we serve, particularly the automotive industry;

•

competition and pricing pressure;

•

market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations and product life cycles;

•

raw material availability, quality, and cost;

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

financial condition and consolidation of customers and vendors;

•

reliance on third-party suppliers;

•

risks associated with current and future acquisitions and divestitures;

•

global risks of business interruptions such as natural disasters and political, economic, and military instability;

•

risks associated with security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure;



•

risks related to compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations;

•

our ability to protect our intellectual property rights;

•

risks of litigation;

•

our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by our debt instruments;

•

the possible effects on us of various U.S. and non-U.S. legislative proposals and other initiatives that, if adopted, could materially increase
our worldwide corporate effective tax rate and negatively impact our U.S. government contracts business;

•

various risks associated with being a Swiss corporation;

•

the impact of fluctuations in the market price of our shares; and

•

the impact of certain provisions of our articles of association on unsolicited takeover proposals.

There
may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with
interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price
movements. We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks.

We
do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are
limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 credit rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty.

Foreign Currency Exposures

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts, foreign currency
forward contracts, and foreign currency swap contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability
due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our cross-currency swap contracts,
foreign currency forward contracts, or foreign currency swap contracts from the fiscal year end 2016 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by $112 million. A 10%
appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our cross-currency swap contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, or foreign currency swap contracts from the fiscal year end 2015
market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by $109 million. Such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the
revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions.

Interest Rate and Investment Exposures

We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To manage the
interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. We use forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate
swaps to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the



anticipated
issuance of fixed-rate debt. We also utilize investment swaps to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities.

Based
on our floating rate debt balances of approximately $300 million at fiscal year end 2016 and $800 million at fiscal year end 2015, an increase in the levels of the
U.S. dollar interest rates by 0.5%, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately $2 million and $4 million in
fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Commodity Exposures

Our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the effects of fluctuations in
the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges. We continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our
forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts in order to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period. At fiscal year end
2016, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, and copper, were in a net gain position of $11 million and had a notional value of $232 million. At
fiscal year end 2015, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, and copper, were in a net loss position of $33 million and had a notional value of
$260 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold, a troy ounce of silver, and a pound of copper, from the fiscal year end 2016 prices would have changed the
unrealized value of our forward contracts by $24 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold, a troy ounce of silver, and a pound of copper, from the fiscal
year end 2015 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $23 million.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2016.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2016, which is included in this Annual Report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of TE Connectivity Ltd.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2016 and September 25,
2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2016. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and
September 25, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2016, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2016, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 15, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of TE Connectivity Ltd.:

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2016, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, and our report dated



November 15,
2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of TE Connectivity Ltd. and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").

Description of the Business

TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") is a global technology
leader. We design and manufacture connectivity and sensor solutions that are essential in today's increasingly connected world. We help our customers solve the need for intelligent, efficient, and
high-performing products and solutions.

We
operate through three reportable segments:

•

Transportation Solutions.

The Transportation Solutions segment is a leader
in connectivity and sensor technologies. Our products, which must withstand harsh conditions, are used in the automotive, commercial transportation, and sensors markets.

•

Industrial Solutions.

The Industrial Solutions segment is a leading
supplier of products that connect and distribute power, data, and signals. Our products are used in the industrial equipment; aerospace, defense, oil, and gas; and energy markets.

•

Communications Solutions.

The Communications Solutions segment is a leading
supplier of electronic components for the data and devices and appliances markets. We are also a leader in developing, manufacturing, installing, and maintaining some of the world's most advanced
subsea fiber optic communications systems.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in these
Consolidated Financial Statements include
restructuring and other charges, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future cash flows and discount rates associated with
asset impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, estimated contract revenue and related costs, legal contingencies, tax
reserves and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension benefit cost. Actual results could differ materially from these
estimates.

Fiscal Year

We have a 52 or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday of September. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth
quarter reporting period includes 14 weeks. Fiscal 2016 was a 53 week year and ended on September 30, 2016. Fiscal 2015 and 2014 were 52 weeks in length and ended on
September 25, 2015 and September 26, 2014, respectively.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

We consolidate entities in which we own or control more than 50% of the voting shares or otherwise have the ability to control through similar
rights. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included on the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of
acquisition or up to the date of disposal.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the
risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.

Contract
revenues for construction related projects, which are generated in the Communications Solutions segment, are recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method.
Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to
total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the
period in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they
first become determinable.

We
generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship
for a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We accept returned goods only when the customer
makes a verified claim and we have authorized the return. Generally, a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a
reduction of sales.

Additionally,
certain of our long-term contracts in the Communications Solutions segment have warranty obligations. Estimated warranty costs for each contract are determined based on the
contract terms and technology-specific considerations. These costs are included in total estimated contract costs and are accrued over the construction period of the respective contracts under
percentage-of-completion accounting.

We
provide certain distributors with an inventory allowance for returns or scrap equal to a percentage of qualified purchases. A reserve for estimated returns and scrap allowances is
established at the time of the sale, based on an agreed upon fixed percentage of sales to distributors, and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Other
allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is
recorded as a reduction of sales. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate the amounts of future allowances.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value using the first-in, first-out cost method, except for inventoried costs incurred
in the performance of long-term contracts primarily by the Communications Solutions segment.

Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net

Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense
when incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 10 to 20 years for land improvements, 5 to 40 years for
buildings and improvements, and 1 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.

We
periodically evaluate, when events and circumstances warrant, the net realizable value of property, plant, and equipment and other long-lived assets, relying on a number of factors
including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the asset group are
evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying asset group.
Impairment of the carrying value is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying value of the asset. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions
concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets
with a determinable life primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, as well as customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1
to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinable-lived intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and
when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation.

At
fiscal year end 2016, we had six reporting units, five of which contained goodwill. There were two reporting units in each of our three segments. When changes occur in the composition
of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.

Goodwill
impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we
believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting unit-specific factors
including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and
management's judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

goodwill
impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the
carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets
and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts
assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Fair
value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The
income approach generally has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax
rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in
future periods.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in research, development, and engineering expenses on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred, and building and overhead expenses. The amounts expensed in fiscal 2016, 2015, and
2014 were $566 million, $540 million, and $484 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740,

Income
Taxes

. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss carryforwards using tax rates in
effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not
that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our
operations. Under the
uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent
to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss
carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to
changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and
related interest.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt, and derivative financial
instruments.

We
account for derivative financial instrument contracts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. For instruments not designated as hedges under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, the changes in
the instruments' fair value are recognized currently in earnings. For instruments designated as cash flow
hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which
the underlying hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of a cash flow hedge, including amounts excluded from the hedging relationship, are recognized currently in earnings. Changes in the
fair value of instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or liability hedged, with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability
being recognized currently in earnings.

We
determine the fair value of our financial instruments by using methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. Standard
market conventions are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, including derivatives.

The
cash flows related to derivative financial instruments are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Our
derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks. Concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated, however, by our use of financial institutions
worldwide, substantially all of which have long-term Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, we utilize only conventional derivative financial
instruments. We are exposed to potential losses if a counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of its agreement. With respect to counterparty net asset positions recognized at fiscal year
end 2016, we have assessed the likelihood of counterparty default as remote. We currently provide guarantees from a wholly-owned subsidiary to the counterparties to our commodity swap derivatives and
exchange cash collateral with the counterparties to our cross-currency swap contracts. The likelihood of performance on the guarantees has been assessed as remote. For all other derivative financial
instruments, we are not required to provide, nor do we require counterparties to provide, collateral or other security.

Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

, specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon
the observable inputs utilized in valuation of certain assets and liabilities. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs
(lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. Fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:

•

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities.

•

Level 2.

Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and
liabilities, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

•

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no
market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flows methodologies, and similar techniques that use
significant unobservable inputs.

Financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are generally valued using level 2 inputs.

Financial
instruments other than derivative instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. These instruments are recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at book value. For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, we believe book value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. See Note 11 for disclosure of the fair value of debt. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial
instruments:

•

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents are valued at book
value, which we consider to be equivalent to unadjusted quoted prices (level 1).

•

Accounts receivable.

Accounts receivable are valued based on the net value
expected to be realized. The net realizable value generally represents an observable contractual agreement (level 2).

•

Accounts payable.

Accounts payable are valued based on the net value
expected to be paid, generally supported by an observable contractual agreement (level 2).

•

Debt.

The fair value of debt, including both current and non-current
maturities, is derived from quoted market prices or other pricing determinations based on the results of market approach valuation models using observable market data such as recently reported trades,
bid and offer information, and benchmark securities (level 2).

Pension

The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference
between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be
paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to
irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors,
such as years of service and compensation.

Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected
average remaining service lives of current participants.

The
measurement of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on estimates and assumptions determined by our management. These valuations reflect the terms of the plans
and use participant-specific information such as compensation, age, and years of service, as well as certain assumptions, including estimates of discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of
compensation increases, interest crediting rates, and mortality rates.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Share-Based Compensation

We determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant. Share options are valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model;
restricted share awards and performance awards are valued using our end-of-day share price on the date of grant. The fair value is expensed ratably over the expected service period, with an allowance
made for estimated forfeitures based on historical employee activity. Estimates regarding the attainment of performance criteria are reviewed periodically; the cumulative impact of a change in
estimate regarding the attainment of performance criteria is recorded in the period in which that change is made.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation arrangements.

Currency Translation

For our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using fiscal year end exchange
rates. Sales and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
within equity.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, which are included in earnings, were immaterial in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014.

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring activities involve employee-related termination costs, facility exit costs, and asset impairments resulting from
reductions-in-force, migration of facilities or product lines from higher-cost to lower-cost countries, or consolidation of facilities within countries. We recognize termination costs based on
requirements established by severance policy, government law, or previous actions. Facility exit costs generally reflect the cost to terminate a facility lease before the end of its term (measured at
fair value at the time we cease using the facility) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the facility lease without future economic benefit to us. Restructuring activities often result in
the disposal or abandonment of assets that require an acceleration of depreciation or impairment reflecting the excess of the assets' carrying values over fair value.

The
recognition of restructuring costs require that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing, and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
To the extent our
actual results differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimated liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring costs or the reduction of
liabilities already recognized. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure these balances are properly stated and the utilization of the reserves are for
their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Acquisitions

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires, among other things, that most assets
acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values, or as required by ASC 805,

Business Combinations

. The excess of the purchase price over the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We may engage independent third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

Contingent Liabilities

We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the
loss is reasonably estimable. When a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists, we record the low end of the range. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is
often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. In addition, it is not uncommon for such matters
to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of that
loss can be made. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a loss is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an update to ASC 718,

Compensation—Stock Compensation

, to
simplify various aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees. This update is effective
for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018; however, we expect to early adopt this update in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect the impact of adoption of the provision addressing accounting
for excess tax benefits and deficiencies will increase noncurrent deferred tax assets and retained earnings by approximately $170 million. Adoption of the remaining provisions of the update
will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842,

Leases

, requiring lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for most
leases. This guidance is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We will adopt the new standard using a modified retrospective transition approach which requires application of the new
guidance for all periods presented. We are currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on our financial position.

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

. This guidance supersedes ASC 605,

Revenue Recognition

, and introduces a single,
comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. ASC 606 also enhances disclosures related to revenue
recognition. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASC 606 by one year. ASC 606 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and allows for either a full retrospective or
a modified retrospective approach at adoption. We are continuing to assess the impact of adopting ASC 606, but do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations or
financial position.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2015, the FASB issued an update to ASC 740 requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a
classified statement of financial position. We elected to early adopt this update on a prospective basis during fiscal 2016. Prior period amounts were not retrospectively adjusted.

In
April 2015, the FASB issued an update to ASC 835,

Interest

, requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability
be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. We elected to early adopt this update during fiscal 2016. The
update was applied on a retrospective basis and did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fiscal 2016 Actions

During fiscal 2016, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures
in the Communications Solutions segment. In connection with this program, during fiscal 2016, we recorded restructuring charges of $130 million. We expect to complete all restructuring actions
commenced during fiscal 2016 by the end of fiscal 2019 and to incur total charges of approximately $171 million with remaining charges related primarily to employee severance.

credits
of $1 million and charges of $92 million, respectively. We do not expect to incur any additional charges related to restructuring programs commenced in fiscal 2015.

Fiscal 2014 Actions

During fiscal 2014, we initiated a restructuring program associated primarily with headcount reductions and manufacturing site and product line
closures in the Communications Solutions segment. In connection with this program, we recorded net restructuring charges of $19 million in fiscal 2014. We do not expect to incur any additional
charges related to restructuring programs commenced in fiscal 2014.

Pre-Fiscal 2014 Actions

During fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recorded net restructuring credits of $4 million, charges of $1 million, and charges of
$4 million, respectively, related to pre-fiscal 2014 actions. We do not expect to incur any additional charges related to pre-fiscal 2014 actions.

Gain on Divestiture

During fiscal 2016, we sold our Circuit Protection Devices ("CPD") business for net cash proceeds of $333 million. We recognized a
pre-tax gain of $144 million on the transaction. The CPD business was reported in our Communications Solutions segment.

Other Charges (Credits), Net

During fiscal 2016, we incurred costs of $21 million, associated primarily with the divestiture of certain businesses.

During
fiscal 2015, in connection with the sale our Broadband Network Solutions ("BNS") business, we incurred costs of $61 million, consisting primarily of $36 million of
legal and professional fees and $18 million of charges associated with the exit of a facility. These amounts are not directly related to the business sold, and accordingly have been recorded in
continuing operations. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the divestiture of BNS.

​

During
fiscal 2015, we sold our BNS business for $3.0 billion in cash and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.1 billion on the transaction. In the U.S., income taxes associated
with the gain on the sale of assets were largely offset by income tax benefits realized on the sale of several subsidiaries. In certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the sale was exempt from income taxes.
During fiscal 2016, we recognized an additional pre-tax gain of $29 million on the divestiture, related primarily to pension and net working capital adjustments.

In
fiscal 2006, the former shareholders of Com-Net initiated a lawsuit related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. In October 2015, the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania entered final judgment in favor of the sellers and against us for $127 million plus costs. In July 2016, we entered into settlement agreements with the sellers pursuant to which we
agreed to pay the sellers an aggregate amount of $96 million, payment of which was made in fiscal 2016, settling all matters in dispute.

In
connection with the Com-Net case, we recorded a reserve and pre-tax charges of $127 million during fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016, in connection with the settlements, we
recorded pre-tax credits of $30 million, representing a release of excess reserves. These amounts are reflected in income from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations as the Com-Net case was associated with our former Wireless Systems business which was sold in 2009.

The
BNS and Wireless Systems businesses met the discontinued operations criteria and were reported as such in all periods presented on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to
reclassification to discontinued operations, the BNS and Wireless Systems businesses were included in the former Network Solutions and Wireless Systems segments, respectively.

5. Acquisitions

Fiscal 2016 Acquisitions

During fiscal 2016, we acquired four businesses, including the Creganna Medical group, for a combined cash purchase price of
$1.3 billion, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions have been reported as part of our Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments from the date of acquisition.

We
have preliminarily allocated the purchase price of acquired businesses to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
values. We

are
in the process of completing the valuation of identifiable intangible assets, fixed assets, pre-acquisition contingencies, and income taxes. Accordingly, the fair values set forth below are
subject to adjustment upon finalization of the valuations. The amount of these potential adjustments could be significant. We expect to complete the purchase price allocation for these acquisitions
during fiscal 2017.

The
following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, in

The
fair values assigned to intangible assets were preliminarily determined through the use of the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty and the multi-period excess
earnings methods. Both valuation methods rely on management judgment, including expected future cash flows resulting from existing customer relationships, customer attrition rates, contributory
effects of other assets utilized in the business, peer group cost of capital and royalty rates, and other factors. Useful lives for intangible assets were determined based upon the remaining useful
economic lives of the intangible assets that are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows.

5. Acquisitions (Continued)

The
acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.

Goodwill
of $836 million was recognized in these transactions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. This goodwill is attributable primarily to cost savings and other synergies related to operational efficiencies including the consolidation of manufacturing, marketing, and
general and administrative functions. The goodwill has been allocated to the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments and is not deductible for tax purposes. However, prior to being
acquired by us, one of the fiscal 2016 acquisitions completed certain acquisitions that resulted in goodwill with an estimated value of $15 million that is deductible primarily for U.S. tax
purposes, which we will deduct through 2025.

Fiscal
2016 acquisitions contributed net sales of $167 million and operating income of $8 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations during fiscal 2016. The
operating income included $10 million of acquisition costs, $7 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments related to acquired inventories and
customer order backlog, and $2 million of integration costs.

Fiscal 2015 Acquisitions

In October 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Measurement Specialties, Inc. ("Measurement Specialties"), a leading
global designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensor-based systems, for $86.00 in cash per share. The total value paid was approximately $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired, and included
$225 million for the repayment of Measurement Specialties' debt and
accrued interest. Measurement Specialties offers a broad portfolio of technologies including pressure, vibration, force, temperature, humidity, ultrasonic, position, and fluid sensors, for a wide
range of applications and industries. This business has been reported as part of our Transportation Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

5. Acquisitions (Continued)

The
acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.

Goodwill
of $1,064 million was recognized in the transaction, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. This goodwill is attributable primarily to cost savings and other synergies related to operational efficiencies including the consolidation of manufacturing, marketing, and
general and administrative functions. The goodwill has been allocated to the Transportation Solutions segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. However, prior to its merger with us, Measurement
Specialties completed certain acquisitions that resulted in goodwill with an estimated value of $23 million that is deductible primarily for U.S. tax purposes, which we will deduct through
2030.

During
fiscal 2015, Measurement Specialties contributed net sales of $548 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Due to the commingled nature of our operations, it
is not practicable to separately identify operating income of Measurement Specialties on a stand-alone basis.

During
fiscal 2015, we acquired three additional businesses for $241 million in cash, net of cash acquired.

Fiscal 2014 Acquisitions

During fiscal 2014, we acquired five businesses, including the SEACON Group ("SEACON"), a leading provider of underwater connector technology
and systems, for $522 million in cash, net of cash acquired.

Pro Forma Financial Information

The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects our consolidated results of operations had the fiscal 2016 acquisitions
occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2015 and the Measurement Specialties acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2014:

The
pro forma financial information for the fiscal 2016 acquisitions was based on our preliminary allocation of the purchase price and therefore is subject to adjustment upon
finalization of the purchase price allocation. The pro forma adjustments, which were not significant, included interest expense based on pro forma changes in our combined capital structure, charges
related to acquired customer order backlog, charges related to the amortization of the fair value of acquired intangible assets, charges related to the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date
inventories, and acquisition and other costs, and the related tax effects.

Pro
forma results do not include any anticipated synergies or other anticipated benefits of these acquisitions. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not
necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had these acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the preceding fiscal years.

The
senior floating rate notes due 2016 bore interest at a rate of three-month London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.20% per year.

During
January 2016, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 3.700% senior notes due
February 15, 2026. The notes are TEGSA's unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any
subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.

TEGSA
has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in December 2015
primarily to extend the maturity date from August 2018 to December 2020. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2016 and 2015.

Borrowings
under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured,
long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Bank of America, N.A.'s base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus


/


of 1%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay
an annual facility fee ranging from 5.0 to 12.5 basis points based upon the amount of the lenders' commitments under the Credit Facility and the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

11. Debt (Continued)

The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as
defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is
triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants.

Periodically,
TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper
program are backed by the Credit Facility.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.

12. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product
liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value
added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable
law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Income Tax Matters

Tax Sharing Agreement

In fiscal 2007, we became an independent, publicly traded company owning the former electronics businesses of Tyco International plc
("Tyco International"). On June 29, 2007, Tyco International



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

12. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

distributed
all of our shares, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders (the "separation"). As a result of subsequent transactions, Tyco
International and Covidien now operate as part of Johnson Controls International plc and Medtronic plc, respectively.

Upon
separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, under which we shared responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a
sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. We, Tyco International, and Covidien shared 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arose from
adjustments made by tax authorities to our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and
indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien.

1997-2000 Audit Years

In October 2012, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") issued special agreement Forms 870-AD, effectively settling its audit of all tax
matters for the years 1997 through 2000, excluding one issue involving the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. The IRS field examination asserted that certain intercompany loans
originated during the years 1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately $2.7 billion of related interest deductions recognized
during the period on Tyco International's U.S. income tax returns. In addition, if the IRS were ultimately successful in asserting its claim, it likely would have disallowed an additional
$6.6 billion of interest deductions reflected on U.S. income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000. Tyco International disagreed with the IRS position and filed petitions in the U.S.
Tax Court contesting the IRS's proposed adjustments.

In
January 2016, Tyco International entered into Stipulations of Settled Issues (the "Stipulations") with the IRS intended to resolve all disputes related to the intercompany debt matter
discussed above. The Stipulations were contingent upon the Appeals Division of the IRS applying the same settlement or framework to all intercompany debt issues on appeal for subsequent audit cycles
(years 2001 through 2007).

During
the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we made a pre-payment to the IRS of $443 million, for deficiencies for which we are the primary obligor, to stop the accretion of
deficiency interest. Concurrent with remitting this payment, we were reimbursed $305 million by Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax
matters. In addition, we paid $2 million to Covidien for our share of deficiencies for which Covidien was the primary obligor. As a result, our net cash payment in connection with the disputed
debt matter was $140 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

In
May 2016, the U.S. Tax Court entered orders consistent with the Stipulations and dismissed the petitions as settled and the Appeals Division of the IRS issued special agreement
Forms 870-AD that effectively settled the matters on appeal on the same terms as those set forth in the Stipulations. As a result, we have resolved all aspects of the disputed debt matter
before the U.S. Tax Court (for the 1997 through 2000 audit cycle) and before the Appeals Division of the IRS for subsequent audit cycles (2001 through 2007). In addition, we expect the terms of the
resolution for the disputed debt matter will be consistently applied by the IRS to all of our U.S. income tax returns filed subsequent to fiscal 2007.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

12. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

As a result of these developments, in fiscal 2016, we recognized an income tax benefit of $1,135 million, representing a reduction in tax reserves, and other expense of
$604 million, representing a reduction of associated indemnification receivables, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. The U.S. tax loss and credit
carryforwards finalized as a result of the settlement of the disputed debt matter were assessed for realizability in fiscal 2016 and included in our valuation allowance analysis. See Note 15
for further information regarding the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

2001-2007 Audit Years

In fiscal 2015, the IRS issued general agreement Forms 870, effectively settling its audits of tax matters for the years 2001 through
2007, excluding the disputed debt matter which was subsequently resolved during fiscal 2016. As a result of these developments, in fiscal 2015, we recognized an income tax benefit of
$201 million, representing a reduction in tax reserves for the matters that were effectively settled, and other expense of $84 million, representing a reduction of associated
indemnification receivables, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien.

2008-2010 Audit Years

In fiscal 2015, the IRS issued general agreement Forms 870, effectively settling its audits of tax matters for the years 2008 through
2010, excluding the disputed debt matter. As discussed above, we expect the terms of the resolution for the disputed debt matter will be consistently applied by the IRS to all of our U.S. income tax
returns filed subsequent to fiscal 2007. As a result of these developments, in fiscal 2015, we recognized an income tax benefit of $63 million, representing a reduction in tax reserves for the
matters that were effectively settled.

Environmental Matters

We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate
cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup
methods. As of fiscal year end 2016, we concluded that it was probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of $17 million to $42 million, and that the best estimate within
this range was $20 million. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash
flows.

Guarantees

In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown
damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing
facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At
fiscal year end 2016, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $324 million.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results
of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

We
generally record estimated product warranty costs when contract revenues are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method for construction related contracts; other warranty
reserves are not significant. The estimation is based primarily on historical experience and actual warranty claims. Amounts accrued for warranty claims at fiscal year end 2016 and 2015 were
$48 million and $35 million, respectively.

13. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements

We use derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, investment, and commodity risks.

The
effects of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were immaterial for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

Foreign Exchange Risks and Hedges of Net Investment

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts, foreign currency
forward contracts, and foreign currency swap contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability
due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. We expect that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
associated with the cash flow hedge-designated instruments addressing foreign exchange risks will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statement of Operations within the next twelve months.

During
fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of €1,000 million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency
exchange risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make quarterly interest payments in euros at 3.50% per
annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.33% per annum. Upon the maturities of these contracts in fiscal 2022, we will pay the principal amount of the loans in euros
and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.

We
hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany non-derivative financial instruments denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of
these hedges was $3,480 million and $3,880 million at fiscal year end 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreign exchange losses of $45 million and foreign exchange gains of
$353 million and $156 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, were recorded as currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
offsetting foreign exchange gains and losses attributable to the translation of the net investment. See Note 19 for additional information.

Interest Rate and Investment Risk Management

We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To manage the
interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. We use forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate
swaps to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt. We also utilize investment swaps to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred
compensation liabilities.

Commodity Hedges

As part of managing the exposure to certain commodity price fluctuations, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in prices of commodities used in production.

At
fiscal year end 2016 and 2015, our commodity hedges had notional values of $232 million and $260 million, respectively. We expect that significantly all of the balance
in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) associated with the commodity hedges will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statement of Operations within the next twelve months.

Amortization
of prior service credit is included in other in the above table summarizing the components of net periodic pension benefit cost.

In
fiscal 2016, unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were primarily the result of lower discount rates partially offset by favorable
asset performance for both U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans as compared to fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) for U.S. defined benefit pension plans were due primarily to a change in the mortality assumption and lower than expected asset performance. Unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2015 were principally the result of lower discount rates as compared to fiscal 2014.

The
estimated amortization of actuarial losses from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic pension benefit cost for U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension
plans in fiscal 2017 is expected to be $40 million and $43 million, respectively. The estimated amortization of prior service credit from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
into net periodic pension benefit cost for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2017 is expected to be $7 million.

In
determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations.

The
investment strategies for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans are governed locally. Our investment strategy for our pension plans is to manage the plans on a going concern basis. Current
investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. Projected returns
are based

primarily
on pro forma asset allocation, expected long-term returns, and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management.

The
long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans' master trust is 10% equity and 90% fixed income. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period
based on the funded status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the "Pension Act Funded Status"), of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions. We expect to reach our target
allocation when the Pension Act Funded Status exceeds 105%. Based on the Pension Act Funded Status as of fiscal year end 2016, our target asset allocation is 45% equity and 55% fixed income.

Our
common shares are not a direct investment of our pension funds; however, the pension funds may indirectly include our shares. The aggregate amount of our common shares would not be
considered material relative to the total pension fund assets.

Our
funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which we operate as well as to make discretionary voluntary contributions
from time to time. We expect to make the minimum required contributions of $6 million and $48 million to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively, in fiscal 2017. We may also
make voluntary contributions at our discretion.

Benefit
payments, which reflect future expected service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

14. Retirement Plans (Continued)

Changes
in Level 3 assets in non-U.S. plans were primarily the result of purchases in fiscal 2016 and 2015.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

We maintain several defined contribution retirement plans, the most significant of which is located in the U.S. These plans include 401(k)
matching programs, as well as qualified and
nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants' compensation and was $59 million,
$60 million, and $61 million for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans

We maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A record keeping
account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds correspond to a number of
funds in our 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Total deferred compensation liabilities were $132 million and $118 million at
fiscal year end 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 13 for additional information regarding our risk management strategy related to deferred compensation liabilities.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension and 401(k) benefits, we also provide certain health care coverage continuation for qualifying retirees from the
date of retirement to age 65. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was $45 million and $40 million at fiscal year end 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the underfunded status
of the postretirement benefit plans was included primarily in long-term pension and postretirement liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Activity during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 was not
significant.

The
income tax benefit for fiscal 2016 included a $1,135 million income tax benefit related to the effective settlement of tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000 which
resolved all aspects of the disputed debt matter with the IRS through the year 2007, partially offset by a $91 million income tax charge related to an increase to the valuation allowance for
certain U.S. deferred tax assets.
Additionally, the tax benefit for fiscal 2016 included an $83 million net income tax benefit related to tax settlements in certain other tax jurisdictions, partially offset by an income tax
charge related to certain legal entity restructurings. See Note 12 for additional information regarding settlements with the IRS.

The
increase to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets primarily relates to certain U.S. federal and state tax loss and credit carryforwards. Based on our forecast of taxable
income for certain U.S. tax reporting groups, U.S. tax loss and credit carryforwards finalized as a result of settlement of the disputed debt matter with the IRS, and certain tax planning actions and
strategies, we believed it was more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized.

The
income tax expense for fiscal 2015 included a $264 million income tax benefit related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the years 2001 through
2010, partially offset by a $216 million income tax charge associated with the tax impacts of certain intercompany legal entity restructurings made in connection with our integration of
Measurement Specialties. Also, income tax expense for fiscal 2015 included an income tax charge of $29 million associated with the tax impacts of certain intercompany dividends related to the
restructuring and sale of BNS.

15. Income Taxes (Continued)

The income tax expense for fiscal 2014 included an income tax benefit of $282 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with certain
tax loss carryforwards relating to ADC Telecommunications, Inc. ("ADC"), partially offset by an income tax charge related to adjustments to prior year income tax returns.

In
fiscal 2014, we acquired SEACON, and its U.S. operations were combined with our ADC U.S. federal consolidated tax group. In addition, the ADC U.S. tax group was combined with other
U.S. legal entities and assets. We reassessed the realization of the revised ADC U.S. tax group's tax loss and credit carryforwards. Based on our forecast of taxable income of the reorganized combined
tax group, we believed it was more likely than not that a tax benefit would be realized on additional U.S. federal and state net operating losses. Accordingly, we reduced the valuation allowance and
recorded a tax benefit of $282 million.

Deferred
income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. The components of the net

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $3,096 million and $3,237 million at fiscal year end 2016 and 2015, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty
of the utilization of certain deferred
tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the income tax benefits
related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At fiscal year end 2016, approximately $169 million of the valuation allowance relates to share-based
compensation and will be recorded to equity if certain net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are utilized.

We
have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in the
future. No additional provision has been made for Swiss or non-Swiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences
related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded
that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of fiscal year end 2016, certain subsidiaries had approximately $21 billion of cumulative
undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and
research and development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such
subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in
subsidiaries. As of fiscal year end 2016, we had approximately $6.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to
distribute to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently
reinvested. We estimate that up to approximately $1.5 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the

Uncertain Tax Position Provisions of ASC 740

As of fiscal year end 2016, we had total unrecognized income tax benefits of $490 million. If recognized in future years,
$370 million of these currently unrecognized income tax benefits would impact income tax expense (benefit) and the effective tax rate. As of fiscal year end 2015, we had total unrecognized
income tax benefits of $1,368 million. If recognized in future years, $1,291 million of these unrecognized income tax benefits would impact income tax expense (benefit) and
the effective tax rate. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized income tax benefits:

We
record accrued interest as well as penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense (benefit). As of fiscal year end 2016 and 2015, we had $54 million
and $1,076 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recorded primarily in income taxes. The decrease in
the accrued interest and penalties from fiscal year end 2015 was due primarily to the effective settlement of tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000 which resolved all aspects of the disputed
debt matter with the IRS through the year 2007. During fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recognized income tax benefits of $765 million, expense of $7 million, and expense of
$99 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We
file income tax returns on a unitary, consolidated, or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions, which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to
4 years. Various state and local income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal.

Our
non-U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns in the countries in which they have operations. Generally, these countries have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to
10 years. Various non-U.S. subsidiary income tax returns are currently in the process of examination by taxing authorities.

In
most jurisdictions, taxing authorities retain the ability to review prior tax years and to adjust any net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from these years that are
utilized in a subsequent period.

Although
it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that up to approximately $90 million of unrecognized income tax benefits,
excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months.

We
are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of fiscal
year end 2016.

16. Other Income (Expense), Net

In fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recorded net other expense of $632 million, net other expense of $55 million, and net other income of $63 million, respectively,
primarily pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. The net other expense in fiscal 2016 included $604 million related to the effective settlement of tax
matters for the years 1997 through 2000 which resolved all aspects of the disputed debt matter with the IRS through the year 2007 and $46 million related to a tax settlement in another
jurisdiction. The net other expense in fiscal 2015 included $84 million related to the effective settlement of undisputed tax matters for the years 2001 through 2007. See Note 12 for
further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement and settlements with the IRS. The net other income in fiscal 2014 included $18 million of income related to our share of a
settlement agreement entered into by Tyco International with a former subsidiary, CIT Group Inc., which arose from a pre-separation claim for which we were entitled to 31% once resolved.

18. Equity

Common Shares

We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of
association, and our Swiss organizational regulations. Accordingly, the par value of our common shares is stated in Swiss francs ("CHF"). We continue to use the U.S. dollar, however, as our reporting
currency on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Subject
to certain conditions specified in our articles of association, we are authorized to increase our conditional share capital by issuing new shares in aggregate not exceeding 50%
of our authorized shares. In March 2016, our shareholders approved for a period of two years ending on March 2, 2018, our board of directors' authorization to issue additional new shares,
subject to certain conditions specified in the articles of association, in aggregate not exceeding 50% of the amount of our authorized shares.

Common Shares Held in Treasury

At fiscal year end 2016, approximately 28 million common shares were held in treasury, of which 2 million were owned by one of our
subsidiaries. At fiscal year end 2015, approximately 20 million common shares were held in treasury, of which 6 million were owned by one of our subsidiaries. Shares held both directly
by us and by our subsidiary are presented as treasury shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In
fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, our shareholders approved the cancellation of 31 million, 5 million, and 10 million shares, respectively, purchased under our share
repurchase program. These capital reductions by cancellation of shares were subject to a notice period and filing with the commercial register in Switzerland.

Contributed Surplus

Contributed surplus established for Swiss tax and statutory purposes ("Swiss Contributed Surplus"), subject to certain conditions, is a freely
distributable reserve. Distributions to shareholders from Swiss

(equivalent to $6,992 million and $7,505 million, respectively).

Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders

Under Swiss law, subject to certain conditions, distributions to shareholders made in the form of a reduction of registered share capital or
from reserves from capital contributions (equivalent to Swiss Contributed Surplus) are exempt from Swiss withholding tax. Distributions or dividends on our shares must be approved by our shareholders.

Our
shareholders approved the following dividends on our common shares:

common shares. At fiscal year end 2016 and 2015, the unpaid portion of the dividends recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $263 million
and $260 million, respectively.

20. Share Plans

Our equity compensation plans, of which the TE Connectivity Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, is the primary plan, provide for the award of annual
performance bonuses and long-term performance awards, including share options; restricted, performance, and deferred share units; and other share-based awards (collectively, "Awards") and allow for
the use of unissued shares or treasury shares to be used to satisfy such Awards. As of fiscal year end 2016, our plans provided for a maximum of 67 million shares to be issued as Awards,
subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the plans. A total of 16 million shares remained available for issuance under our plans as of fiscal year end 2016.

Share-Based Compensation Expense

Total share-based compensation expense, which was included primarily in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations, was as follows:

We
recognized a related tax benefit associated with our share-based compensation arrangements of $29 million, $29 million, and $24 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and
2014, respectively.

Restricted Share Awards

Restricted share awards, which are generally in the form of restricted share units, are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of
vesting are determined at the time of grant. All restrictions on an award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies retirement requirements, a portion of the award
may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Recipients of restricted share units have no voting rights, but do receive dividend equivalents. For grants that vest through
passage of time, the fair value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on the closing
value of our shares on the grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest in increments over a period of four years as determined by the management development and compensation committee.

As
of fiscal year end 2016, there was $74 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted share awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.6 years.

Performance Share Awards

Performance share awards, which are generally in the form of performance share units, are granted with pay-out subject to vesting requirements
and certain performance conditions that are determined at the time of grant. Based on our performance, the pay-out of performance share units can range from 0% to 200% of the number of units
originally granted. The grant-date fair value of performance share awards is expensed over the period of performance once achievement of the performance criteria is deemed probable. Recipients of
performance share units have no voting rights but do receive dividend equivalents. Performance share awards generally vest after a period of three years as determined by the management development and
compensation committee.

Share Options

Share options are granted to purchase our common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of the common shares on
the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies
retirement requirements, a portion of the award may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Options generally vest and become exercisable in equal annual installments over
a period of four years and expire ten years after the date of grant.

to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.

Share-Based Compensation Assumptions

The grant-date fair value of each share option grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Use of a valuation model
requires management to make certain assumptions with



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

20. Share Plans (Continued)

respect
to selected model inputs. We employ our historical share volatility when calculating the grant-date fair value of our share option grants using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model.
Currently, we do not have exchange-traded options of sufficient duration to employ an implied volatility assumption in the calculation and therefore rely solely on the historical volatility
calculation. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate was
based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term that approximated the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share was based on our expected
dividend rate. The recognized share-based compensation expense was net of estimated forfeitures, which are based on voluntary termination behavior as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

The
weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted and the weighted-average assumptions we used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model were as follows:

21. Segment and Geographic Data

We operate through three reportable segments: Transportation Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Communications Solutions. See Note 1 for a description of the segments in which
we operate. We aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based upon similar economic characteristics and business groupings of products, services, and customers.

Segment
performance is evaluated based on net sales and operating income. Generally, we consider all expenses to be of an operating nature and, accordingly, allocate them to each
reportable segment. Costs specific to a segment are charged to the segment. Corporate expenses, such as headquarters administrative costs, are allocated to the segments based on segment operating
income. Intersegment sales were not material and were recorded at selling prices that approximate market prices. Corporate assets are allocated to the segments based on segment assets.
