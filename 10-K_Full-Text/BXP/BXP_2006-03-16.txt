PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

As used herein, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to Boston Properties, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in 1997, individually or together with its
subsidiaries, including Boston Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and our predecessors. We are a fully integrated self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or “REIT,” and one of the
largest owners and developers of office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets—Boston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, N.J. We conduct substantially all of our business
through our subsidiary, Boston Properties Limited Partnership. At December 31, 2005, we owned or had interests in 121 properties, totaling approximately 42.0 million net rentable square feet and structured parking for vehicles containing
approximately 9.3 million square feet. Our properties consisted of:

•

117 office properties comprised of 100 Class A office properties (including three properties under construction) and 17 Office/Technical properties;

•

two hotels; and

•

two retail properties.

We own or control undeveloped land totaling approximately 527.1 acres, which will support approximately 9.2 million square feet of development. In
addition, we have a 25% interest in the Boston Properties Office Value-Added Fund, L.P., which we refer to as the “Value-Added Fund,” which is a strategic partnership with two institutional investors through which we intend to pursue the
acquisition of assets within our existing markets that have deficiencies in property characteristics which provide an opportunity to create value through repositioning, refurbishment or renovation. Our investments through the Value-Added Fund are
not included in our portfolio information tables or any other portfolio level statistics.

We consider Class A office properties to be centrally-located buildings that are professionally managed and maintained, attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern
structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings. The Company considers Office/Technical properties to be properties that support office, research and development and other technical uses. Our definitions of Class A office and
Office/Technical properties may be different than those used by other companies.

We are a full-service real estate company, with substantial in-house expertise and resources in acquisitions, development, financing, capital markets, construction management, property management, marketing, leasing,
accounting, tax and legal services. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 673 employees. Our thirty-four senior officers have an average of twenty-three years experience in the real estate industry and an average of fifteen years of
experience with us. Our principal executive office is located at 111 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02199 and our telephone number is (617) 236-3300. In addition, we have regional offices at 901 New York Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C.
20004; 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022; Four Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, California 94111; and 302 Carnegie Center, Princeton, New Jersey 08540.

Our Web site is located at http://www.bostonproperties.com. On our Web site, you can obtain a copy of our annual report on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable
after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The name “Boston Properties” and our logo (consisting of a stylized “b”) are registered service marks of the
Company.



Boston Properties Limited Partnership

Boston Properties Limited Partnership, or BPLP, is a Delaware limited partnership, and the entity through which we conduct
substantially all of our business and own, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of our assets. We are the sole general partner and, as of March 1, 2006, the owner of approximately 80.92% of the economic interests in BPLP.
Economic interest was calculated as the number of common partnership units of BPLP owned by the Company as a percentage of the sum of (1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP, (2) the number of common
partnership units issuable upon conversion of outstanding preferred partnership units of BPLP and (3) the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding long term incentive plan units of BPLP, or LTIP units, assuming all
conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP units. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted common stock. Our general and limited partnership interests in BPLP entitle us to share in cash
distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, BPLP in proportion to our percentage interest and entitle us to vote on all matters requiring a vote of the limited partners. Certain other partners of BPLP are persons who contributed their
direct or indirect interests in properties to BPLP in exchange for common units or preferred units of limited partnership interest in BPLP. Under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, unitholders may present their common units of BPLP for
redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of the units that may restrict such right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of a unit for redemption, BPLP must redeem the
unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of our common stock. In lieu of cash redemption by BPLP, however, we may elect to acquire any common units so tendered by issuing shares of our common stock in exchange for the common units. If we so
elect, our common stock will be exchanged for common units on a one-for-one basis. This one-for-one exchange ratio is subject to specified adjustments to prevent dilution. We generally expect that we will elect to issue our common stock in
connection with each such presentation for redemption rather than having BPLP pay cash. With each such exchange or redemption, our percentage ownership in BPLP will increase. In addition, whenever we issue shares of our common stock other than to
acquire common units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership, we must contribute any net proceeds we receive to BPLP and BPLP must issue to us an equivalent number of common units of BPLP. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella
partnership REIT, or “UPREIT.”

Preferred units of
BPLP have the rights, preferences and other privileges, including the right to convert into common units of BPLP, as are set forth in an amendment to the limited partnership agreement of BPLP. As of December 31, 2005 and March 1, 2006,
BPLP had one series of its preferred units outstanding. The Series Two preferred units have an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $185.1 million. The Series Two preferred units are convertible, at the holder’s election, into
common units at a conversion price of $38.10 per common unit (equivalent to a ratio of 1.312336 common units per Series Two preferred unit). Distributions on the Series Two preferred units are payable quarterly and, unless the greater rate described
in the next sentence applies, accrue at 7.0% until May 12, 2009 and 6.0% thereafter. If distributions on the number of common units into which the Series Two preferred units are convertible are greater than distributions calculated using the
rates described in the preceding sentence for the applicable quarterly period, then the greater distributions are payable instead. Since May 2005, distributions have been made at the greater rate determined on the basis of distributions paid on the
common units into which the Series Two preferred units are convertible. The terms of the Series Two preferred units provide that they may be redeemed for cash in six annual tranches, beginning on May 12, 2009, at our election or at the election
of the holders. We also have the right to convert into common units of BPLP any Series Two preferred units that are not redeemed when they are eligible for redemption.

Transactions During 2005

Real Estate Acquisitions/Dispositions

On December 30, 2005, we acquired Prospect Place, a Class A office property totaling approximately 297,000 net rentable square feet located in
Waltham, Massachusetts, at a purchase price of approximately $62.8 million financed with available cash.



On December 20, 2005, our Value-Added Fund acquired 300 Billerica Road, a 111,000 net rentable
square foot office property located in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, at a purchase price of approximately $10.0 million. The acquisition was financed with new mortgage indebtedness totaling $7.5 million and approximately $2.5 million in cash, of which
our share was approximately $0.6 million.

On December 14,
2005, we sold Embarcadero Center West Tower, a Class A office property totaling approximately 475,000 net rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California, at a gross sale price of approximately $205.8 million. Net cash proceeds
totaled $195.2 million after customary closing costs, transaction-related expenses and unfunded tenant obligations totaling approximately $10.6 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $48.4 million (net of minority interest share of
approximately $9.8 million). The transaction-related expenses consisted of approximately $6.6 million of tax reimbursement and gross-up obligations due to the contributors of the property pursuant to the related tax protection agreement.

On November 7, 2005, we sold 40-46 Harvard Street, an
industrial property totaling approximately 152,000 net rentable square feet located in Westwood, Massachusetts, at a sale price of approximately $7.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $5.9 million (net of minority interest share
of approximately $1.1 million).

On November 4, 2005, we
sold the Residence Inn by Marriott

®

, a 221-room
extended-stay hotel property located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at a gross sale price of approximately $68.0 million, less customary closing costs and a credit of approximately $3.0 million representing the property controlled furniture, fixtures
and equipment escrow set aside for planned property upgrades, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $33.4 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $6.5 million).

On May 16, 2005, we sold Riverfront Plaza, a Class A office property totaling approximately 910,000 net rentable
square feet located in Richmond, Virginia, for approximately $247.1 million. Net proceeds totaled approximately $129.9 million after the repayment of mortgage indebtedness of $104.0 million, a prepayment penalty of approximately $4.3 million and
unfunded tenant obligations and other closing costs totaling $8.9 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $57.0 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $11.5 million).

On May 12, 2005, we sold 100 East Pratt Street, a Class A office
property totaling approximately 639,000 net rentable square feet located in Baltimore, Maryland, for approximately $207.5 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $92.8 million after the repayment of mortgage indebtedness of $84.0 million, a
prepayment penalty of approximately $6.5 million and unfunded tenant obligations and other closing costs totaling $24.2 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $45.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $9.1
million).

On April 20, 2005, we sold the Old Federal
Reserve, a Class A office property totaling approximately 150,000 net rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California, at a sale price of approximately $46.8 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $45.9 million, resulting in
a gain on sale of approximately $8.4 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $1.7 million).

On February 28, 2005, we sold Decoverly Four and Five, consisting of two undeveloped land parcels located in Rockville, Maryland for net cash
proceeds of approximately $5.3 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $1.2 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.2 million).

On February 23, 2005, we sold a parcel of land at the Prudential Center located in Boston, Massachusetts for a net sale
price of approximately $31.5 million and an additional obligation of the buyer to fund an estimated $18.6 million of future costs at the Prudential Center (of which approximately $18.5 million has been received as of December 31, 2005) for
aggregate proceeds of $50.1 million. Due to the structure of the transaction and certain continuing involvement provisions related to the development of the property, this transaction did not



qualify as a sale for financial reporting purposes and was accounted for as a financing transaction in fiscal 2005. In January 2006 the continuing
involvement provisions were satisfied and the transaction qualified as a sale for financial reporting purposes.

Developments

On January 1, 2005, we placed in-service 901 New York Avenue, a 539,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in Washington,
D.C., in which we have a 25% ownership interest. This property required a total investment during 2005 of approximately $3.9 million which was funded through construction loan draws. Our total investment, including equity and debt, through
December 31, 2005 in 901 New York Avenue was approximately $44.0 million.

On October 1, 2005, we placed in-service the West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This garage will provide parking for approximately 800 cars.
As of December 31, 2005 our total investment in the West Garage was approximately $16.6 million with an estimated total investment of $18.9 million.

As of December 31, 2005 we had five active construction projects underway, which aggregate an estimated total investment of $317.6 million. Our Seven
Cambridge Center and Parcel E (12290 Sunrise Valley) are fully leased to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Lockheed Martin Corporation, respectively. On September 26, 2005, we commenced construction on 505 9

th

Street in Washington, D.C., a joint venture project in which we have a 50% interest. The project consists of a build-to-suit
Class A office property totaling approximately 323,000 net rentable square feet, of which 230,000 net rentable square feet have been pre-leased to a law firm for a 15-year term. The estimated total investment for our properties under
construction as of December 31, 2005 is detailed below:

On January 17,
2006, we placed-in-service our Seven Cambridge Center development project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Equity Transactions

During the year ended December 31, 2005, holders of Series Two preferred units of BPLP converted 381,000 Series Two preferred units into 500,000
common units of limited partnership interest. The common units of limited partnership interest were subsequently presented by the holders for redemption and were acquired by us in exchange for an equal number of shares of common stock. In addition,
during the year ended December 31, 2005, we acquired an aggregate of 424,976 common units of limited partnership interest, presented by the holders for redemption, in exchange for an equal number of shares of common stock and an aggregate of
25,000 common units of limited partnership interest presented by the holder for cash. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we issued 1,270,436 shares of common stock as a result of stock options being exercised.



Special Dividend

On July 21, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $2.50 per common share which was paid on
October 31, 2005 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2005. The special cash dividend was in addition to the regular quarterly dividend of $0.68 per common share that was paid on October 31, 2005. The holders of
common partnership units of BPLP received the same amount, at the same time. Holders of Series Two preferred units of limited partnership interest participated in the special cash dividend on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular
February 2006 distribution payment as provided in BPLP’s partnership agreement.

Business and Growth Strategies

Business Strategy

Our primary business
objective is to maximize return on investment so as to provide our investors with the greatest possible total return. Our strategy to achieve this objective is:

•

to concentrate on a few carefully selected geographic markets, including Boston, Washington D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, N.J., and to be one of the leading,
if not the leading, owners and developers in each of those markets. We select markets and submarkets where tenants have demonstrated a preference for high-quality office buildings and other facilities;

•

to emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where the lack of available sites and the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development and the necessary
financing constitute high barriers to the creation of new supply, and where skill, financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop, finance and manage high-quality office, research and development space as well as selected
retail space;

•

to take on complex, technically challenging projects, leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop, acquire or reposition properties which other
organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue;

•

to concentrate on high-quality real estate designed to meet the demands of today’s tenants who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure and support
services, and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients;

•

to opportunistically acquire assets which increase our penetration in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate and which exhibit an opportunity to improve or preserve
returns through repositioning (through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy), changes in management focus and re-leasing as existing leases terminate;

•

to explore joint venture opportunities primarily with existing owners of land parcels located in desirable locations, who seek to benefit from the depth of development and
management expertise we are able to provide and our access to capital, and/or to explore joint venture opportunities with strategic institutional partners, leveraging our skills as owners, operators and developers of Class A office space;

•

to pursue on a selective basis the sale of properties, including core properties, to take advantage of our value creation and the demand for our premier properties (see “Part
II, Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview” beginning on page 36);

•

to seek third-party development contracts, which benefits us when our internal development is less active or when new development is less-warranted due to market conditions, which
can be a significant source of revenue and enables us to retain and utilize our existing development and construction management staff; and

•

to enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital.



Growth Strategies

External Growth

We believe that our development experience and our organizational depth position us to continue to selectively develop a range of property types,
including single-story suburban office properties, high-rise urban developments, mixed-use developments and research and laboratory space, within budget and on schedule. Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include:

•

our control of sites (including sites under contract or option to acquire) in our markets that will support approximately 9.2 million square feet of new office, hotel and
residential development;

•

our reputation gained through 36 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties;

•

our relationships with leading national corporations and public institutions seeking new facilities and development services;

•

our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry;

•

our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provides comfort to domestic and foreign institutions, private investors and corporations who seek to sell
commercial real estate in our market areas;

•

our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing; and

•

our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality real estate assets.

Opportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three categories:

•

Development in selected submarkets.

As market conditions continue to improve, we believe that development of well-positioned office buildings will be justified in many of our
submarkets. We believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time. While we purposely concentrate in
markets with high barriers-to-entry, we have demonstrated throughout our 36-year history, an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms.
We believe that there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a well-capitalized developer to acquire land with development potential.

In the past, we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental
approvals for development. Because of our development expertise, knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies, we generally have been able to secure the permits
necessary to allow development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value. We seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment.

Our strong regional relationships and recognized development
expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development
opportunities through multiple business cycles.

•

Acquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions or individuals.

We believe that due to our size, management strength and reputation, we are
well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria. We may acquire properties for cash, but we are also particularly well-positioned to appeal to sellers wishing
to convert on a tax-deferred basis their ownership of property into equity in a diversified real estate operating



company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution. Our ability to offer common and preferred
units of limited partnership in BPLP to sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets for cash or our common stock may facilitate this type of transaction on a tax-efficient basis. In addition, we may consider mergers
with and acquisitions of compatible real estate firms.

•

Acquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets

. We believe that because of our in-depth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets,
our national reputation with brokers, financial institutions and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively-priced capital, we are well-positioned to identify and acquire existing, underperforming properties for
competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies and a responsive property management program. We have developed this strategy and program for our existing portfolio, where we
provide high-quality property management services using our own employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand and relocate in our properties. We are able to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants
through the use of in-house and third-party vendors’ services for marketing, including calls and presentations to prospective tenants, print advertisements, lease negotiation and construction of tenant improvements. Our tenants benefit from
cost efficiencies produced by our experienced work force, which is attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management.

Internal Growth

We believe that significant opportunities will exist in the long term to increase cash flow from our existing properties because they are of high quality
and in desirable locations. In addition, our properties are in markets where, in general, the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites, the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development on vacant land and
the difficulty of obtaining financing. Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is two-fold: (1) to provide high-quality property management services using our employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand
and relocate in our properties, and (2) to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in-house services for marketing, lease negotiation and construction of tenant improvements. We believe
that with the continued improvement of the economy, our office properties will add to our internal growth because of their desirable locations. In addition, we believe that with the continued improvement in the business and leisure travel sector,
our two hotel properties will continue to add to our internal growth because of their desirable locations in the downtown Boston and East Cambridge submarkets. We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to:

•

Cultivate existing submarkets and long-term relationships with credit tenants

.

In choosing locations for our properties, we have paid particular attention to
transportation and commuting patterns, physical environment, adjacency to established business centers, proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors.

We had an average lease term of 7.3 years at December 31, 2005 and continue to cultivate long-term leasing
relationships with a diverse base of high quality, financially stable tenants. Based on leases in place at December 31, 2005, leases with respect to 4.5% of the total square feet from our Class A office properties will expire in calendar
year 2006.

•

Directly manage properties to maximize the potential for tenant retention.

We provide property management services ourselves, rather than contracting for this service, to
maintain awareness of and responsiveness to tenant needs. We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to
assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in tenant relations.

•

Replace tenants quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs

. We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new tenants
and achieve relatively high rental rates as a



result of our well-located, well-designed and well-maintained properties, our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to tenants,
and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets.

•

Extend terms of existing leases to existing tenants prior to expiration.

We have also successfully structured early tenant renewals, which have reduced the cost associated
with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality credit-worthy tenants on a long-term basis and enhancing relationships.

Policies with Respect to Certain Activities

The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been determined
by our Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by our Board of Directors.

Investment Policies

Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate

Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends to our securityholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases
in the value of Boston Properties, Inc. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives.

We expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties, development projects and other
acquired properties. We currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment, and acquisitions of land that we believe have development
potential, primarily in our markets—Boston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, N.J. Future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets. We intend to engage in
such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we may purchase or lease income-producing commercial and other types of
properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such real estate properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. We do not have a policy that restricts the
amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property, however, our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants.

We may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. These investments may
permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and, therefore, add flexibility in structuring our portfolio.

Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection
with acquiring or refinancing these investments. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to our common stock. Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).

Investments in Real Estate Mortgages

While our current portfolio consists of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of
the Board of Directors, invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests consistent with our qualification as a REIT. Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that
the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup its full investment. We do not presently intend to invest in



mortgages or deeds of trust, but may invest in participating or convertible mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any
appreciation in value of the property.

Securities of or
Interests in Persons Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities

Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for our REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other
issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.

Dispositions

Our disposition of
properties is based upon the periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the Board of Directors that such action would be in our best interests. Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors or a
committee thereof. Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP, including Messrs. Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Edward H. Linde and other executive officers, would incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that
differ from the tax consequences to us. Consequently, holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale. Such different tax treatment derives in most cases
from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain. Generally this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the
properties in a taxable transaction. Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like-kind exchange or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue, recognition of the deferred tax gain allocable to these prior owners is
generally triggered by the sale. Certain assets are subject to tax protection agreements, which may limit our ability to dispose of the assets or require us to pay damages to the prior owners in the event of a taxable sale.

Financing Policies

The agreement of limited partnership of BPLP and our certificate of
incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur. We do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. However, our mortgages, credit facilities and unsecured debt securities
contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. We have not established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole.

Our Board of Directors will consider a number of factors when
evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, including the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing,
the entering into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties and BPLP as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service.

Policies with Respect to Other Activities

As the sole general partner of BPLP, we have the authority to issue
additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP. We have in the past, and may in the future, issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP to persons who contribute their direct or indirect
interests in properties to us in exchange for such common or preferred units of limited partnership interest in BPLP. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than BPLP and we do not
intend to do so. At all times, we intend to make investments in such a manner as to maintain our qualification as a REIT, unless because of circumstances or changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or the Treasury Regulations), our
Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a REIT. We may make loans to third parties, including, without limitation, to joint ventures in which we participate. We intend to make investments in such a way
that we will not be treated as an investment



company under the 1940 Act. Our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the Board of
Directors.

Competition

We compete in the leasing of office space with a considerable number of other
real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us. In addition, our hotel properties compete for guests with other hotels, some of which may have greater marketing and financial
resources than are available to us and to the manager of our hotels, Marriott

®

International, Inc.

Principal
factors of competition in our primary business of owning, acquiring and developing office properties are the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and
convenience of location, the quality and breadth of tenant services provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in the relevant market. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends
of the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental
regulations, legislation and population trends.

The Hotel
Properties

On November 4, 2005, we sold our Residence
Inn by Marriott

®

at Six Cambridge Center, leaving
us with two hotel properties. We operate our two hotel properties through a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). The TRS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to leases for each of the hotel properties. As lessor, BPLP is
entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel properties. The hotel leases allow all the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us. Marriott

®

International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel properties under the Marriott

®

name and under terms of the existing management agreements. Marriott has been engaged
under separate long-term incentive management agreements to operate and manage each of the hotels on behalf of the TRS. In connection with these arrangements, Marriott has agreed to operate and maintain the hotels in accordance with its system-wide
standard for comparable hotels and to provide the hotels with the benefits of its central reservation system and other chain-wide programs and services. Under a separate management agreement for each hotel, Marriott acts as the TRS’ agent to
supervise, direct and control the management and operation of the hotel and receives as compensation base management fees that are calculated as a percentage of the hotel’s gross revenues, and supplemental incentive fees if the hotel exceeds
negotiated profitability breakpoints. In addition, the TRS compensates Marriott, on the basis of a formula applied to the hotel’s gross revenues, for certain system-wide services provided by Marriott, including central reservations, marketing
and training. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, Marriott received an aggregate of approximately $4.2 million, $4.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively, under the management agreements.

Seasonality

Our hotel properties traditionally have experienced significant seasonality in their operating income, with the percentage of net operating income by

Corporate Governance

Boston Properties is currently managed by a ten member
Board of Directors, which is divided into three classes (Class I, Class II and Class III). Our Board of Directors is currently composed of three Class I directors



(Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Carol B. Einiger and Richard E. Salomon), four Class II directors (Lawrence S. Bacow, Zoë Baird, Alan J. Patricof and Martin
Turchin) and three Class III directors (William M. Daley, Edward H. Linde and David A. Twardock). The members of each class of our Board of Directors serve for staggered three-year terms, and the terms of our current Class I, Class II and Class III
directors expire upon the election and qualification of directors at the annual meetings of stockholders held in 2007, 2008 and 2006, respectively. At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors will be elected or re-elected for a full term of
three years to succeed those directors whose terms are expiring.

Our Board of Directors has Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. The membership of each of these committees is described below.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. We refer to the shares of our common stock and the units of limited
partnership interest in BPLP together as our “securities,” and the investors who own shares or units, or both, as our “securityholders.” This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the
qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 34.

Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.

Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our office
and hotel properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected. The following
factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our office and hotel properties:

•

downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment);

•

competition from other office, hotel and commercial buildings;

•

local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, hotel or other commercial space;

•

changes in interest rates and availability of attractive financing;

•

vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;

•

increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;

•

civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;

•

significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when
circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property;

•

declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; and

•

decreases in the underlying value of our real estate.

We are dependent upon the economic climates of our markets—Boston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, N.J.

Our revenue is derived from properties located in five markets: Boston,
Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, N.J. A downturn in the economies of these markets, or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies, could result in reduced demand for
office space. Because our portfolio consists primarily of office buildings (as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio), a decrease in demand for office space in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, there
are submarkets within our core markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries. For example, in our Washington, D.C. market we are primarily dependent on leasing office properties to governmental agencies and contractors, as well as
legal firms. In our midtown Manhattan market we have historically leased properties to financial, legal and other professional firms. A significant downturn in one or more of these sectors could adversely affect our results of operations.



Our investment in property development may be more costly than anticipated.

We intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office
properties. Our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:

•

we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;

•

we may incur construction costs for a development project which exceed our original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased materials, labor, leasing or other
costs, which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs;

•

we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in
increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;

•

we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and as a result we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred;

•

we may expend funds on and devote management’s time to projects which we do not complete; and

•

we may be unable to complete construction and/or leasing of a property on schedule.

Investment returns from our developed properties may be lower than anticipated.

Our developed properties may be exposed to the following risks:

•

we may lease developed properties at rental rates that are less than the rates projected at the time we decide to undertake the development; and

•

occupancy rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investments
being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all.

Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.

In appropriate circumstances, we intend to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the
use of these structures. We currently have seven joint ventures that are not consolidated with our financial statements. Our share of the aggregate revenue of these joint ventures represented approximately 3% of our total revenue (the sum of our
total consolidated revenue and our share of such joint venture revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:

•

we could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop or operate a property;

•

our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties; and

•

our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.

In addition, our ability to enter into other joint ventures with third
parties to pursue the acquisition of value-added investments similar to those being pursued by the Value-Added Fund is limited by the terms of the Value-Added Fund’s partnership agreement.



We face risks associated with property acquisitions.

We have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the
acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:

•

even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non-refundable deposit and incurring certain other
acquisition-related costs;

•

we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;

•

acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;

•

the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be greater than our estimates;

•

the acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within
our control, which may not be satisfied;

•

acquired properties may be located in new markets where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business
relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and

•

we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP. This acquisition
structure has the effect, among others, of reducing the amount of tax depreciation we can deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and typically requires that we agree to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of
taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. These restrictions on dispositions could limit our ability to sell an
asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.

Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.

We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse against the prior owners or other third parties, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a
liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to
acquired properties might include:

•

liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;

•

claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;

•

liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and

•

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties.

We plan to continue to acquire properties as we are
presented with attractive opportunities. We may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors, particularly private investors who can incur more leverage, and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the
following risks:

•

we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and private REITs, institutional
investment funds and other real estate investors; and



•

even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.

We face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space.

We derive most of our income from rent received from
our tenants. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. Also, when our tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate early, we may not be able to
re-let the space. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. As a result, our
cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected.

We face potential adverse effects from major tenants’ bankruptcies or insolvencies.

The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. Our tenants could
file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future. We cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. On the other hand, a bankrupt tenant may reject and terminate its lease with us. In such case, our claim against the
bankrupt tenant for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and, even so, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. This
shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.

We may have difficulty selling our properties, which may limit our flexibility.

Large and high-quality office and hotel properties like the ones that we own could be difficult to sell. This may limit our ability to change our
portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our
securityholders. These restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to dispose of some of our properties is constrained by their tax
attributes. Properties which we developed and have owned for a significant period of time or which we acquired through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP often have low tax bases. If we dispose of
these properties outright in taxable transactions, we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our securityholders under the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code for REITs, which in turn would impact our cash
flow. In some cases, without incurring additional costs we may be restricted from disposing of properties contributed in exchange for our partnership interests under tax protection agreements with contributors. To dispose of low basis or
tax-protected properties efficiently we often use like-kind exchanges, which qualify for non-recognition of taxable gain, but can be difficult to consummate and result in the property for which the disposed assets are exchanged inheriting their low
tax bases and other tax attributes (including tax protection covenants).

Our properties face significant competition.

We face significant competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from our tenants. Substantially all of our properties face competition from
similar properties in the same market. This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge. These competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may
result in their owners being willing to lease available space at lower rates than the space in our properties.



Because we own two hotel properties, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry.

Because the lease payments we receive under the hotel
leases are based on a participation in the gross receipts of the hotels, if the hotels do not generate sufficient receipts, our cash flow would be decreased, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders.
The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel properties:

•

our hotel properties compete for guests with other hotels, a number of which have greater marketing and financial resources than our hotel-operating business partners;

•

if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, our hotel-operating business partners may not be able to offset such increase by increasing
room rates;

•

our hotel properties are subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism; and

•

our hotel properties are subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war and terrorism.

In addition, because our hotel properties are
located within two miles of each other in downtown Boston and Cambridge, they are subject to the Boston market’s fluctuations in demand, increases in operating costs and increased competition from additions in supply.

Because of the ownership structure of our two hotel properties, we face potential
adverse effects from changes to the applicable tax laws.

We own two hotel properties. However, under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs like us are not allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we lease our hotel properties to one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, or
TRS. As lessor, we are entitled to a percentage of the gross receipts from the operation of the hotel properties. Marriott International, Inc. manages the hotels under the Marriott

®

name pursuant to a management contract with the TRS as lessee. While the TRS structure allows the economic benefits of
ownership to flow to us, the TRS is subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotels at the federal and state level. In addition, the TRS is subject to detailed tax regulations that affect how it may be capitalized and operated. If the
tax laws applicable to TRSs are modified, we may be forced to modify the structure for owning our hotel properties, and such changes may adversely affect the cash flows from our hotels. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States
Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, and we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such actions may
prospectively or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the TRS and, therefore, may adversely affect our after-tax returns from our hotel properties.

Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires
that public buildings, including office buildings and hotels, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If, under the
Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or
private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.



Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.

We carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts and
with deductibles that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. In response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal Terrorism
Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, was enacted in November 2002 to require regulated insurers to make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the statute) through December 31, 2004, which date was extended to
December 31, 2005 by the United States Department of Treasury on June 18, 2004 and which date was further extended to December 31, 2007 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (the “TRIA Extension Act”). TRIA
expires on December 31, 2007, and we cannot currently anticipate whether it will be extended. Effective as of March 1, 2006, our property insurance program per occurrence limits were decreased from $1 billion to $800 million, including
coverage for both “certified” and “non-certified” acts of terrorism by TRIA. The amount of such insurance available in the market has decreased because of the natural disasters which occurred during 2005. We also carry nuclear,
biological and chemical terrorism insurance coverage (“NBC Coverage”) for “certified” acts of terrorism as defined by TRIA, which is provided by IXP, Inc. as a direct insurer. Effective as of March 1, 2006, we extended the
NBC Coverage to March 1, 2007, excluding our Value-Added Fund properties. Effective as of March 1, 2006, the per occurrence limit for NBC Coverage was decreased from $1 billion to $800 million. Under TRIA, after the payment of the required
deductible and coinsurance the NBC Coverage is backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a “program trigger.” Under the TRIA Extension Act (a) the
program trigger is $5 million through March 31, 2006, $50 million from April 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 and $100 million from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007 and (b) the coinsurance is 10% through
December 31, 2006 and 15% through December 31, 2007. We may elect to terminate the NBC Coverage when the program trigger increases on January 1, 2007, if there is a change in our portfolio or for any other reason. We intend to
continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable.

We also currently carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes in an amount and subject to
self-insurance that we believe are commercially reasonable. In addition, this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. Specifically, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our San
Francisco portfolio with a $120 million per occurrence limit and a $120 million aggregate limit, $20 million of which is provided by IXP, Inc., as a direct insurer. The amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover
losses from earthquakes. As a result of increased costs of coverage and limited availability, the amount of third-party earthquake insurance that we may be able to purchase on commercially reasonable terms may be reduced. In addition, we may
discontinue earthquake insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage.

In January 2002, we formed a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, IXP, Inc., or IXP, to act as a captive insurance company and be one of the elements of
our overall insurance program. IXP acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage for our Greater San Francisco properties and our NBC Coverage for “certified acts of terrorism” under TRIA. Insofar
as we own IXP, we are responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP are part of our consolidated financial statements. In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by our NBC Coverage but is less than the
applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government. If we experience a loss and IXP is required to pay under our insurance policy, we would ultimately record
the loss to the extent of IXP’s required payment. Therefore, insurance coverage provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the
scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism in particular, but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars or the presence of
mold at our properties, for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. With respect to such



losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits,
we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage
indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations.

Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties.

We have significant investments in large metropolitan
markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks, including midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C., Boston and San Francisco. As a result, some tenants in these markets may choose to relocate their
businesses to other markets or to lower-profile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity. This could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these
markets generally or in our properties in particular, which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both. In addition, future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly
or indirectly damage our properties, both physically and financially, or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline
materially. See also “

—Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.

”

Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs.

Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of
hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. If unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments, which
could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders, because:

•

as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination;

•

the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination;

•

even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the
clean-up costs; and

•

governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs.

These costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the amount
of our insurance or the value of the contaminated property. We currently carry environmental insurance in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. Specifically, we carry a pollution legal liability policy
with a $10 million limit per incident and a policy aggregate limit of $25 million. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may materially and adversely affect our ability
to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. In addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination. Changes in laws
increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties, or increasing the restrictions on the handling, storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in
significant unanticipated expenditures.

Environmental laws
also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos:

•

properly manage and maintain the asbestos;



•

notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and

•

undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building.

Such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who
fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.

Some of our properties are located in urban and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses
of the areas have caused site contamination. It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties. These assessments
generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state, federal and historical documents, but do not
involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling. Where appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing, including sampling for asbestos, for lead in drinking
water, for soil contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage creates a potential environmental problem, and for contamination in groundwater. Even though these environmental assessments are
conducted, there is still the risk that:

•

the environmental assessments and updates did not identify all potential environmental liabilities;

•

a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments;

•

new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and

•

future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us.

Inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and,
depending on the results, remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs. Indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological
contaminants such as molds, pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants above certain levels can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible
individuals. If these conditions were to occur at one of our properties, we may need to undertake a targeted remediation program, including without limitation, steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants. Such
remediation programs could be costly, necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the property’s tenants or require rehabilitation of the affected property.

We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.

We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing,
including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to need
to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If principal
payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant “balloon” payments
come due.

We have agreements with a number of limited partners
of BPLP who contributed properties in exchange for partnership interests that require BPLP to maintain for specified periods of time secured debt on certain of our



assets and/or allocate partnership debt to such limited partners to enable them to continue to defer recognition of their taxable gain with respect to the
contributed property. These tax protection and debt allocation agreements may restrict our ability to repay or refinance debt.

An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell
assets.

As of December 31, 2005, we had
approximately $874.1 million of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, and we may incur more of such indebtedness in the future. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which could adversely affect our cash
flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures. We have entered into
interest rate swap agreements with respect to a portion of our variable rate debt, and we may in the future enter into similar agreements, including swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts. While these agreements are
intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform, the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying
transactions will fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended” (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In
addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third-parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary
covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facility, unsecured debt securities and secured
construction loans contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of
unencumbered assets to unsecured debt, which we must maintain. Our continued ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants. In addition, our failure to comply with such covenants could
cause a default under the applicable debt agreement, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive
terms. Additionally, in the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders’ insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism than is available
to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms, particularly if TRIA is not extended beyond December 31, 2007.

We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual
properties, to finance our acquisition and development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or to refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and
results of operations would likely be adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan. In addition, our
unsecured debt agreements contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. Defaults
under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock or debt securities.

On March 1, 2006, we had approximately $4.7 billion in total
indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis (i.e., excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt). Debt to market capitalization ratio, which measures total



debt as a percentage of the aggregate of total debt plus the market value of outstanding equity securities, is often used by analysts to gauge leverage for
equity REITs such as us. Our market value is calculated using the price per share of our common stock. Using the closing stock price of $84.75 per share of our common stock of Boston Properties, Inc. on March 1, 2006, multiplied by the sum of
(1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP (including common partnership units held by us), (2) the number of common partnership units available upon conversion of all outstanding preferred partnership
units of BPLP and (3) the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP units assuming all conditions have been met for conversion of the LTIP units, our debt to market capitalization ratio was approximately 28.49% as
of March 1, 2006.

Our degree of leverage could affect our
ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. Our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by the three major rating agencies.
However, there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain this rating, and in the event our senior debt is downgraded from its current rating, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and/or difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Our
degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. There is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio, which is in part a function of our stock price, or our ratio of
indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities.

Further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders.

The interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future
developments, acquisitions, or repay indebtedness. Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and
equity financing, including common and preferred equity.

Failure to
qualify as a real estate investment trust would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends.

If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes, we will be taxed as a
corporation. We believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT and intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we are qualified as such, or that we will remain
qualified as such in the future. This is because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations
and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax
laws with respect to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.

In addition, we currently hold certain of our properties, and the Value-Added Fund holds its properties, through a subsidiary that has elected to be taxed
as a REIT and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as REITs. If any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a REIT for
federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each
of the years involved because:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

•

we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes;



•

unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were
disqualified; and

•

all dividends will be subject to tax as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will no longer be required
to pay dividends. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and it would adversely affect the value of our common stock.

In order to maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds during
unfavorable market conditions.

In order to maintain
our REIT status, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. To qualify as REIT, we generally must distribute to
our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding capital gains. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends paid by us in any calendar year are less than the
sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We may need short-term debt or long-term debt or proceeds from asset sales, creation of joint ventures or sales of common
stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of
reserves or required debt or amortization payments. The inability of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise short and long-term debt or sell equity securities in order to fund
distributions required to maintain our REIT status.

Limits on changes in
control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, as well as provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Delaware corporate law,
may:

•

delay or prevent a change of control over us or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to our stockholders; and

•

limit our stockholders’ opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then-prevailing market prices.

Stock Ownership Limit

To facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a REIT and to otherwise
address concerns relating to concentration of capital stock ownership, our certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 6.6% of the number of outstanding
shares of any class or series of our equity stock. We refer to this limitation as the “ownership limit.” Our board of directors may waive or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership
in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, under our certificate of incorporation each of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde, along with their respective families and
affiliates, as well as, in general, pension plans and mutual funds, may actually and beneficially own up to 15% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our equity common stock. Shares owned in violation of the ownership limit
will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties. The ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.

BPLP’s Partnership Agreement

We have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP not to engage in specified extraordinary transactions,
including, among others, business combinations, unless limited partners of BPLP other than Boston



Properties, Inc. receive, or have the opportunity to receive, either (1) the same consideration for their partnership interests as holders of our common
stock in the transaction or (2) limited partnership units that, among other things, would entitle the holders, upon redemption of these units, to receive shares of common equity of a publicly traded company or the same consideration as holders
of our common stock received in the transaction. If these limited partners would not receive such consideration, we cannot engage in the transaction unless limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest,
other than those held by Boston Properties, Inc. or its affiliates, consent to the transaction. In addition, we have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP that we will not complete specified extraordinary transactions, including among
others, business combinations, in which we receive the approval of our common stockholders unless (1) limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by Boston Properties, Inc. or
its affiliates, consent to the transaction or (2) the limited partners of BPLP are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as common stockholders on the transaction.
Therefore, if our common stockholders approve a specified extraordinary transaction, the partnership agreement requires the following before we can complete the transaction:

•

holders of partnership interests in BPLP, including Boston Properties, Inc., must vote on the matter;

•

Boston Properties, Inc. must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as our stockholders voted on the transaction; and

•

the result of the vote of holders of partnership interests in BPLP must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders, the business combination would have been approved.

As a result of these provisions, a potential
acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal, and we may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed extraordinary transaction, including a proposed business combination, even though our stockholders approve of the
transaction.

Shareholder Rights Plan

We have a shareholder rights plan. Under the terms of this plan, we can in
effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock because, unless we approve of the acquisition, after the person acquires more than 15% of our outstanding common stock, all other
stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value. This would substantially reduce the value and influence of the stock owned by the acquiring person. Our board of directors can
prevent the plan from operating by approving the transaction in advance, which gives us significant power to approve or disapprove of the efforts of a person or group to acquire a large interest in our company.

We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.

Our operating and financial policies, including our
policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies.

Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.

We depend on the efforts of key personnel,
particularly Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Chairman of our Board of Directors, and Edward H. Linde, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Among the reasons that Messrs. Zuckerman and Linde are important to our success is that each has a national
reputation, which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders. If we lost their services, our relationships with lenders, potential tenants and industry personnel could diminish. Mr. Zuckerman has
substantial outside business interests that could interfere with his ability to devote his full time to our business and affairs.

Our three Executive Vice Presidents and other executive officers that serve as managers of our regional offices also have strong reputations. Their
reputations aid us in identifying opportunities, having opportunities



brought to us, and negotiating with tenants and build-to-suit prospects. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss
of their services could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, prospective tenants and industry personnel.

Conflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in BPLP.

Sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of interests in BPLP
than on our stockholders.

Some holders of interests in
BPLP, including Messrs. Zuckerman and Linde, would incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the tax consequences to us and our stockholders. Consequently, these
holders of partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt. While we have exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP to determine
when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, subject, in the case of certain properties, to the contractual commitments described below, any such decision would require the approval of our Board of
Directors. While the Board of Directors has a policy with respect to these matters, as directors and executive officers, Messrs. Zuckerman and Linde could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority,
of our stockholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.

Agreement not to sell some properties.

Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer some of our properties, prior to specified
dates, in any transaction that would trigger taxable income, without first obtaining the consent of Messrs. Zuckerman and Linde. However, we are not required to obtain their consent if, during the applicable period, each of them does not hold at
least 30% of his original interests in BPLP, or if those properties are transferred in a nontaxable transaction. In addition, we have entered into similar agreements with respect to other properties that we have acquired in exchange for partnership
interests in BPLP. Pursuant to those agreements, we are responsible for the reimbursement of certain tax-related costs to the prior owners if the subject properties are sold in a taxable sale. In general, our obligations to the prior owners are
limited in time and only apply to actual damages suffered. As of December 31, 2005, there were a total of 27 wholly-owned properties subject to these restrictions, and those properties are estimated to have accounted for approximately 40% of
our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005.

BPLP has also entered into agreements providing prior owners of properties with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and, in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced, additional and/or
substitute indebtedness. These agreements may hinder actions that we may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because we would be required to make payments to the beneficiaries of such agreements if we violate these
agreements.

Messrs. Zuckerman and Linde will continue to
engage in other activities.

Messrs. Zuckerman and Linde
have a broad and varied range of investment interests. Either one could acquire an interest in a company which is not currently involved in real estate investment activities but which may acquire real property in the future. However, pursuant to
each of their employment agreements, Messrs. Zuckerman and Linde will not, in general, have management control over such companies and, therefore, they may not be able to prevent one or more of such companies from engaging in activities that are in
competition with our activities.



Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

As with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of our common
stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the value of our common stock are the following:

•

the extent of investor interest in our securities;

•

the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based
companies;

•

our underlying asset value;

•

investor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally;

•

national economic conditions;

•

changes in tax laws;

•

our financial performance;

•

change in our credit rating; and

•

general stock and bond market conditions.

The market value of our common stock is based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future
earnings and cash dividends. Consequently, our common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than our net asset value per share of common stock. If our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected, it is likely that the
market price of our common stock will diminish.

The number of shares
available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our stock.

In connection with and subsequent to our initial public offering, we have completed many private placement transactions in which shares of capital stock of Boston Properties, Inc. or partnership interests in BPLP were
issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional investors. This common stock, or common stock issuable in exchange for such partnership interests in BPLP, may be sold in the public securities markets over time under registration
rights we granted to these investors. Additional common stock issuable under our employee benefit and other incentive plans, including as a result of the grant of stock options and restricted equity securities, may also be sold in the market at some
time in the future. Future sales of our common stock in the market could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of our common
stock.

We did not obtain new owner’s title insurance policies in
connection with properties acquired during our initial public offering.

We acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion of our initial public offering in June 1997. Before we acquired these properties, each of them was insured by a title insurance policy. We did
not obtain new owner’s title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of these properties. However, to the extent we have financed properties after acquiring them in connection with the IPO, we have obtained new title insurance
policies. Nevertheless, because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by acquiring ownership of the entity that owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries, some of these title insurance policies
may continue to benefit us. Many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties. If there was a title defect related to any of these properties, or to any of the properties
acquired at the time of our initial public offering, that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose both our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property. We have obtained title insurance policies for all
properties that we have acquired after our initial public offering, however, these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties.



We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.

From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are
enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required
to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends.

We face possible state and local tax audits.

Because we are organized and qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject
to federal income taxes, but are subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. Although we believe that
we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from
the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations.

Properties

At December 31, 2005, our portfolio consisted of 121 properties totaling 42.0 million net rentable square feet. Our properties consisted of
(1) 117 office properties, comprised of 100 Class A office buildings, including 3 properties under construction and 17 properties that support both office and technical uses, (2) two retail properties and (3) two hotels. In
addition, we own or control 527.1 acres of land for future development. The table set forth below shows information relating to the properties we owned, or in which we had an ownership interest, at December 31, 2005. Information relating to
properties owned by the Value-Added Fund is not included in our portfolio information tables or any other portfolio level statistics because the Value-Added Fund invests in assets within our existing markets that have deficiencies in property
characteristics which provide an opportunity to create value through repositioning, refurbishment or renovation. We therefore believe including such information in our portfolio tables and statistics would render the portfolio information less
useful to investors. Information relating to the Value-Added Fund is set forth below separately.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

(a) Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol “BXP.” The high and low sales prices and distributions for the periods indicated in the table below were:

(1)

Paid on January 30, 2006 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 30, 2005.

(2)

For the three months ended September 30, 2005, amount includes the $2.50 per common share special dividend which was paid on October 31, 2005 to shareholders of record as
of the close of business on September 30, 2005.

At March 1, 2006, we had approximately 274 stockholders of record. This does not include beneficial owners for whom Cede & Co. or others act as nominee.

In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of
our taxable income (not including net capital gains). We have adopted a policy of paying regular quarterly distributions on our common stock, and we have adopted a policy of paying regular quarterly distributions on the common units of BPLP. Cash
distributions have been paid on our common stock and BPLP’s common units since our initial public offering. Distributions are declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on actual and anticipated cash from operations, our
financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and other factors the Board of Directors may consider relevant.

For the three months ended December 31, 2005 there were no unregistered
issuances of stock and no repurchases of stock.

Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth our selected financial and operating data on a historical basis, which has been revised for the reclassification of
(1) losses from early extinguishments of debt in accordance with SFAS No. 145, (2) the restatement of earnings per share to include the effects of participating securities in accordance with EITF 03-6 and (3) the disposition of
qualifying properties during 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002 which have been reclassified as discontinued operations, for the periods presented, in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Refer to Notes 6, 14 and 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following data should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Our historical operating results may not be comparable to our future
operating results.



(1)

Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), we
calculate Funds from Operations, or “FFO,” by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization,
and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of
operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance
because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based
on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO
reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amount represents our share, which was 83.74%, 82.97%, 82.06%,
81.98% and 81.23% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, after allocation to the minority interest in the Operating Partnership.

In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2003, 2002 and 2001 we also disclose FFO, as adjusted, which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, adjustments for non-qualifying
derivative contracts and early lease surrender payments.

The
adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt results when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debt’s stated maturity and to write-off unamortized loan costs at
the date of the extinguishment. Such costs are excluded from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP. However, we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an
incremental cost of the sale transactions because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions. We believe that this supplemental
adjustment more appropriately reflects the results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions.



The adjustments for net derivative losses related to non-qualifying derivative contracts for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 resulted from interest rate contracts we entered into prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to variable rate debt associated
with real estate projects under development. Upon transition to SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, the impacts of these contracts were recorded in current earnings, while prior to that time they were capitalized. Although these adjustments
were attributable to a single hedging program, the underlying contracts extended over multiple reporting periods and therefore resulted in adjustments from the first quarter of 2001 through the third quarter of 2003. Management presents FFO before
the impact of non-qualifying derivative contracts because economically this interest rate hedging program was consistent with our risk management objective of limiting our exposure to interest rate volatility and the change in accounting under GAAP
did not correspond to a substantive difference. Management does not currently anticipate structuring future hedging programs in a manner that would give rise to this kind of adjustment.

The adjustments for early lease surrender for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 resulted from a unique lease
transaction related to the surrender of space by a tenant that was accounted for as a termination for GAAP purposes and recorded in income at the time the space was surrendered. However, we continued to collect payments monthly after the surrender
of space through the month of July 2002, the date on which the terminated lease would otherwise have expired under its original terms. Management presents FFO after the early surrender lease adjustment because economically this transaction impacted
periods subsequent to the time the space was surrendered by the tenant and, therefore, recording the entire amount of the lease termination payment in a single period made FFO less useful as an indicator of operating performance. Although these
adjustments are attributable to a single lease, the transaction impacted multiple reporting periods and resulted in adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Although our FFO, as adjusted, clearly differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, and may not be comparable to that of
other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that, by excluding the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales
of real estate, adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts and early lease surrender payments, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real
estate industry in presenting FFO.

Neither FFO, nor FFO as
adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance
with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO, as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and considered in
addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

A reconciliation of FFO, and FFO, as adjusted, to net income available to common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP is provided under the
heading of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Funds from Operations.”

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report
on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions “Business-Business and Growth Strategies,” “Risk Factors” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in



writing from time to time, are based on management’s beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used,
the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “project,” “result” “should,” “will,”
and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which
may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ
materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when
they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on
past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.

Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by
forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:

•

general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants’ financial condition, and
competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate);

•

risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments including the risk associated with interest rates impacting
the cost and/or availability of financing;

•

risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements;

•

failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets or to integrate acquisitions successfully;

•

risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and
public opposition to such activities);

•

risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets;

•

risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks;

•

risks associated with the impact on our insurance program if TRIA, which expires on December 31, 2007, is not extended or is extended on different terms;

•

costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws;

•

potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;

•

risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws;

•

risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and

•

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.

The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including “Part I, Item 1A—Risk
Factors,” include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not
possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual



results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we
may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on Form 8-K or otherwise.

Overview

We are a
fully integrated self-administered and self-managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets—Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington,
D.C., San Francisco and Princeton, N.J. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the
rental rate to be paid, the costs of tenant improvements, operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors. We also generate cash through
the sale of assets, which may be either non-core assets that have limited growth potential or core assets that command premiums from real estate investors.

We continue to believe our corporate strategy of owning and developing high-quality office buildings concentrated in strong, supply-constrained markets
and emphasizing long-term leases to creditworthy tenants has allowed us to perform well relative to our peers in difficult markets and even better in favorable markets. In addition, we believe our financial strategy of matching long-term fixed-rate
debt with our long-term leases helps to insulate us from rising interest costs and, accordingly, we have fixed the interest rate on approximately 82% of our outstanding debt.

The office markets in which we operate showed dramatic improvement in 2005. In particular, our portfolio experienced strong
rental rate growth over the past twelve month period in our midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. markets and our suburban Boston submarkets. We expect this trend to continue, but its impact on our rental revenues will be felt
gradually given the modest magnitude of 2006 lease expirations, some of which reflect the high rents achieved in the late 1990s. In Boston and San Francisco, which make up approximately 74% of our office rollover in 2006, we believe the average
expiring rent is between 7% and 10% greater than the current market rents.

During 2005, we completed the sale of $838 million of assets while retaining property management on several of the significant properties sold, paid a special dividend of $2.50 per common share in October 2005 and
increased our regular quarterly dividend for the eighth consecutive year. Including dividends, we delivered a total return of 23.6% to our shareholders in 2005. Our regional operating teams completed more than 4.1 million square feet of leasing
in 2005 while prudently managing transaction costs and non-recurring capital expenses and we increased our occupancy from 92.1% to 93.8%. Other highlights of our 2005 activity include the following:

•

We placed in-service our 901 New York Avenue project, a 539,000 square-foot Class A office building located in Washington, D.C. in which we have a 25% interest.

•

We placed in-service the West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts which will provide parking for approximately 800
cars.

•

We continued development on four active construction projects and commenced construction on one additional project during the year, which aggregate an estimated total investment of
$317.6 million as of December 31, 2005.

•

In late December 2005, we acquired Prospect Place, a 297,000 square foot Class A office building, for a purchase price of $62.8 million. We intend to invest an additional $8.8
million in this property. Also, in December 2005, our Value-Added Fund acquired 300 Billerica Road, an 111,000 square foot office property, for a purchase price of approximately $10.0 million, of which our share was approximately $2.5 million.



•

During 2005, we adopted an interest rate hedging program. As of December 31, 2005, we had entered into twelve forward-starting interest rate swap contracts which fix the
ten-year treasury rate for anticipated financings in early 2007 at a weighted-average rate of 4.34% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $500.0 million.

Looking ahead we believe the best utilization of our management skills is in the continued success of our development
strategies. Given current market conditions, we generally believe that the returns we can generate from developments will be significantly greater than those we can expect to realize from acquisitions. As a result, we continue to pursue new
development opportunities, which is one of our core capabilities. We are also considering alternative uses (i.e., non-office) for some of our land holdings and may participate or undertake alternative development projects.

We also expect that allocators of capital will continue to place a premium on
high-quality, well located office buildings resulting in lower capitalization rates and higher prices per square foot. As an owner of these types of assets, we are pleased with higher valuations, and in 2006 we intend to selectively sell some of our
assets (including large core assets) to realize some of this value. While the amount of gross proceeds that we will ultimately realize from these asset sales is uncertain, the Company expects that the magnitude of the sales in 2006 could be
significantly greater than the $838 million of assets sold in 2005. However, there can be no assurance that we will sell any of our assets on favorable terms or at all.

Unfortunately, the same market conditions that are leading to record valuations for Class A office buildings and that
make significant asset sales attractive to us are also continuing to make it more difficult for us to acquire assets at what we believe to be attractive rates of return. To the extent that we successfully sell a significant amount of assets and
cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our
indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and
anticipated leverage, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for the Company to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable
gains realized from any asset sales.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting
policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results,
adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters
that are inherently uncertain.

Real Estate

Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired
tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, “above-” and “below-market” leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations” and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and
buildings at replacement cost.



We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as
available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an
acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value,
including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants’ credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship
intangible assets has been immaterial.

We record acquired
“above-” and “below-market” leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to
each in-place lease and (2) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term
of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease. Factors
to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and
other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other
related expenses.

Real estate is stated at depreciated cost.
The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal
wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development.

Management reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment
in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset
over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future
periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be “long-lived assets to be held and used” as defined by SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” (“SFAS No. 144”)
are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or
market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment
losses have been recognized to date.

SFAS No. 144, which
was adopted on January 1, 2002, requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as “held for sale,” be presented as discontinued operations in all periods
presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the property’s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the
net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be “held for sale” when the
transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification
of a property as “held for sale,” no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.



A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After
determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgement.
Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 “Capitalization of Interest Cost” and SFAS No. 67 “Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Properties.” The
costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real
estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no
later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the
portion under construction.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Except for ownership interests in variable interest
entities, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in
Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is
amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net
income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of
joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture’s distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, we consolidate
those in which we are the primary beneficiary.

Revenue Recognition

Base rental revenue is reported on a straight-line
basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place “above-” and “below-market” leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective
leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements.

Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet
our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenant’s creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant
credit quality, we:

•

review relevant financial information, including:

•

financial ratios;

•

net worth;

•

debt to market capitalization; and

•

liquidity;

•

evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant’s management team; and

•

assess the strength/growth of the tenant’s industry.

As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories:

•

low risk tenants;

•

the tenant’s credit is such that we require collateral in which case we:

•

require a security deposit; and/or

•

reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or

•

the tenant’s credit is below our acceptable parameters.



We maintain a rigorous process of monitoring the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an
allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant’s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential loses that we deem to be
unrecoverable over the term of the lease.

Tenant receivables
are assigned a credit rating of 1-4 with a rating of 1 representing the highest possible rating with no allowance recorded and a rating of 4 representing the lowest credit rating, recording a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the
factors considered in determining the credit rating include:

•

payment history;

•

credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric);

•

change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize);

•

tenant financial performance;

•

economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and

•

industry specific credit considerations.

If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining
term of our in-place tenant leases was approximately 7.3 years as of December 31, 2005. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants’ risk profiles prior to lease execution
and continual monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.

Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant
reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 99-19 “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent,” or Issue 99-19. Issue 99-19 requires that these reimbursements
be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk.

Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as
charges to guests for long-distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned.

We receive management and development fees from third parties. Management
fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and
record development fees on a straight-line basis or percentage of completion depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party
partners’ ownership interest.

Gains on sales of real
estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.” The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transactions
and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the
finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.

Depreciation and Amortization

We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to
land, building, tenant improvements, acquired “above-” and “below-market” leases, origination costs and



acquired in-place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of
acquired “above-” and “below-market” leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage
notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market
rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the
fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate.

Results of Operations

The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 121, 125 and 140 properties, respectively (the “Total Property
Portfolio”). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period
financial data are comparable. Therefore, the comparisons of operating results for the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the “Same
Property Portfolio”) and the changes attributable to the Total Property Portfolio.

In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us
throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same
Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.

Net operating income, or “NOI,” is a non-GAAP financial measure
equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest), minority interest in Operating Partnership, net
derivative losses, losses from early extinguishments of debt, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income
from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in property partnerships, interest and other income and
development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income
and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.

Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource
allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and
development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property’s results of
operations. For example, interest expense is



not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In
addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define
NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an
alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004

The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The
Same Property Portfolio consists of 109 properties, including two hotels and three properties in which we have joint venture interests, acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2004 and owned by us through December 31, 2005.
The Total Property Portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2004 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2005. This table includes a reconciliation from
Same Property Portfolio to Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the properties which were sold, acquired, placed in-service or repositioned during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Our net property operating
margins for the Total Property Portfolio, which are defined as rental revenue less operating expenses, exclusive of the two hotel properties, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, were 68.8% and 69.2%, respectively.

Rental Revenue

The increase of $42.4 million in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that represent our Total
Property Portfolio. Rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $38.8 million, Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $28.5 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $7.2 million, Properties Sold
decreased approximately $30.8 million and Properties Repositioned decreased approximately $1.3 million.

The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to placing in-service Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park,
Building Two during the third quarter of 2004, and the West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development in the fourth quarter of 2005 as detailed below:

Rental revenue from
the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $28.5 million from 2004. Included in rental revenue is an overall increase in base rental revenue of approximately $8.9 million due to increases in our occupancy from 92.1% on December 31,
2004 to 93.8% on December 31, 2005 which was offset by a roll-down in market rents. Straight-line rent increased approximately $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. Approximately $13.6
million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants attributed to higher operating expenses. With respect to leases that expire during the next year, we anticipate that occupancy will continue
to increase which will be offset by a roll-down of approximately 5% to 6% on the estimated market rents. We currently expect net operating income from the Same Property Portfolio to increase up to 2% in 2006 compared to 2005.

The acquisition of Prospect Place on December 30, 2005, 1330 Connecticut
Avenue on April 1, 2004 and the purchase of the remaining interest in 140 Kendrick Street on March 24, 2004 increased revenue from Properties Acquired by approximately $7.2 million, as detailed below:



The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by the sales of Embarcadero Center West Tower,
Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street during 2005, and Hilltop Office Center during 2004. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property. Revenue
from Properties Sold decreased by approximately $30.8 million, as detailed below:

In September 2004, we
commenced the redevelopment of our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. Capital Gallery is a Class A office property totaling approximately 397,000 square feet. The project entails removing a three-story low-rise section of the property
comprised of 100,000 square feet from in-service status and developing it into a 10-story office building resulting in a total complex size of approximately 610,000 square feet upon completion. This property is included in Properties Repositioned
for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Rental revenue has decreased for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to taking the three-story low-rise section out of service in September 2004.

Termination Income

Termination income for year ended December 31, 2005 was related to
twenty-three tenants across the Total Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, and we recognized termination income totaling approximately $11.5 million. This compared to termination income earned for the year ended December 31, 2004
related to nineteen tenants totaling $4.0 million. During 2005 we completed several leasing transactions which involved taking space back from tenants with resulting termination income and releasing the space at higher rents. We currently anticipate
realizing approximately $4.0 million in termination income for the year ended 2006.

Operating Expenses

The $22.0 million
increase in property operating expenses in the Total Property Portfolio (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) is comprised of increases and decreases within the five
categories that represent our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $23.3 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $8.4 million, Properties Acquired increased
approximately $1.4 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $10.3 million and Properties Repositioned decreased approximately $0.8 million.

Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004.
Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in utility expenses of approximately $10.2 million, an increase of approximately 14% over the prior year utility expense. In addition, real estate taxes increased approximately
$7.9 million due to increased real estate tax assessments, with approximately half of this increase specifically attributed to properties located in New York City. The remaining $5.2 million increase in the Same Property Portfolio operating expenses
are related to an increase to repairs and maintenance.



We placed in-service Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third
quarter of 2004 and the West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development in the fourth quarter of 2005 increasing operating expenses by approximately $8.4 million as detailed below:

In addition,
approximately $1.4 million of the increase in Total Property Portfolio operating expenses primarily relates to the acquisitions of Prospect Place at the end of 2005 as well as our acquisitions in 2004 of 1330 Connecticut Avenue and the remaining
interest in 140 Kendrick Street, as detailed below:

A decrease of
approximately $10.3 million in Total Property Portfolio operating expenses relates to the sales of Embarcadero Center West Tower, 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in 2005, and Hilltop Office Center in 2004, as detailed below:

We continue to
review and monitor the impact of rising insurance costs and energy costs, as well as other factors, on our operating budgets for fiscal year 2006. Because some operating expenses are not recoverable from tenants, an increase
in operating expenses due to one or more of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Hotel Net Operating Income

Net operating income for the hotel properties increased by approximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. For the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 the Residence Inn by Marriott

®

was included as part of discontinued operations due to its sale on November 4, 2005. We expect the two remaining hotels to contribute in the aggregate between approximately $20.0 million and $21.0 million of net
operating income in 2006.



The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our hotel properties for the year ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004. This information excludes the Residence Inn by Marriott

Development and Management
Services

Our third-party fee income decreased
approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 due to the completion of third-party development projects at the National Institute of Health in Washington, D.C. and near completion of our project at 90 Church
Street in New York City, partially offset by maintaining management contracts in connection with certain of our asset sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, development fees decreased approximately $4.9 million, offset by an increase in
management fees and service income of approximately $1.8 million. We expect our third-party management and development fee income in 2006 to be between $13.0 million and $15.0 million.

Interest and Other Income

Interest and other income increased by approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. In the first quarter of 2004
we recognized a net amount of approximately $7.0 million of other income in connection with the termination by a third-party of an agreement to enter into a ground lease with us. Excluding this termination, interest and other income increased
approximately $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher cash balances as well as higher interest rates during 2005 compared to 2004.

Other Expenses

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses increased approximately $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Approximately $2.2
million of the increase was attributable to changes in the form of long-term equity-based compensation, as further described below. In addition, there was an overall increase to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2005. These
increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $2.8 million attributable to a refund of prior year state taxes based on income and net worth as a result of changes to a state tax law.

Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed
to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees
generally vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five-year term (for awards granted prior to 2003, vesting is in equal annual installments; for those granted in 2003 and beyond, vesting is over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%,
25%, 35% and 40%). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in
January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding
previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to “stock-based compensation.” Stock-based compensation expense associated with $6.1 million of equity-based compensation that was granted in January 2003 will generally be
expensed ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vests over a five-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $9.7 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2004 and approximately $11.4



million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2005 will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vest. To the extent
we continue to grant restricted stock and/or LTIP Unit awards, our expense will continue to increase significantly until 2008 even if there are no future increases in the aggregate value of restricted equity granted each year. This is because we
expense the value of the restricted stock and LTIP Unit awards ratably over the five-year vesting period and a full run-rate will not be achieved until 2008.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. The
majority of the increases/decreases are due to (1) the cessation of interest capitalization at Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two, which increased interest expense by $14.9 million, and (2) the assumption of
debt in connection with the acquisition of the remaining interest in 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue in the second quarter of 2004, which increased interest expense by $1.3 million. These increases were offset by (1) the
repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sales of Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street in the second quarter of 2005, as well as Embarcadero Center West Tower in October 2005, which decreased interest expense by $9.7
million, and (2) the repayment of mortgage debt at One and Two Reston Overlook and the 12300 and 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive buildings in the beginning of 2004 which decreased interest expense by $1.4 million. In addition, the impact of
refinancing our fixed rate debt collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue using borrowings under our unsecured line at a lower interest rate decreased interest expense approximately $3.0 million.

At December 31, 2005, our variable rate debt consisted of our
construction loans on our Times Square Tower, Capital Gallery Expansion and Seven Cambridge Center construction projects, as well as our borrowings under our unsecured line of credit. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of
December 31, 2005 compared with December 31, 2004:

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total
Property Portfolio increased approximately $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Depreciation and amortization from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $10.8 million, Properties Acquired increased
approximately $1.6 million, The Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $14.8 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $6.8 million and Properties Repositioned decreased approximately $3.3 million. In connection with the
redevelopment project at Capital Gallery, which is classified as Properties Repositioned, we recognized an accelerated depreciation charge of approximately $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2004 representing the net book value of the portion of
the three-story, low-rise section of the building being redeveloped.



The additions to the Total Property Portfolio through acquisitions increased depreciation and
amortization expense by approximately $1.6 million, as detailed below:

The additions to the
Total Property Portfolio through placing properties in-service increased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $10.8 million, as detailed below:

Capitalized Costs

Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not
included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes,
insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $5.9 million. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed
above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $5.7 million and $10.8 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. During the third quarter of 2004, we placed
in-service Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two development projects and ceased capitalizing the related interest in accordance with our capitalization policy.

Losses from early extinguishments of debt

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss from early
extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $12.9 million. In connection with the sales of 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza, we repaid the mortgage loans collateralized by the properties totaling approximately $188 million. For the year
ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $11.0 million, consisting of prepayment fees of approximately $10.8 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of
approximately $0.2 million. We also recognized a $1.9 million loss from early extinguishment of debt which relates to the refinancing of our Times Square Tower mortgage loan which is included in Properties placed in-service, as well as the
modification of our unsecured line of credit.

For the year
ended December 31, 2004, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $6.3 million related to the repayments of our mortgage loans collateralized by One and Two Reston Overlook and the 12300 and 12310 Sunrise
Valley Drive buildings.



Joint Ventures

During the first quarter of 2005, we placed in-service 901 New York Avenue, a 539,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in
Washington, D.C., in which we have a 25% ownership interest. The addition of this property contributed approximately $2.1 million to joint venture income for the year ended December 31, 2005. As of March 1, 2006, this property is 99.3%
leased.

Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest

The decrease in income from discontinued operations
in the Total Property Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2005 was a result of properties sold or designated as held for sale during 2005 and 2004 which are no longer included in our operations as of December 31, 2005. Below is a
list of properties included in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004:

Gains on sales of real estate
and other assets, net of minority interest

Gains on
sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sales of Riverfront Plaza, 100 East Pratt Street and Embarcadero Center West Tower which are not included in discontinued operations due to
our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of these properties after the sales. Also included in gains on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2005 is the sale of Decoverly Four and Five, consisting of two
undeveloped land parcels located in Rockville, Maryland.

Gains
on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2004 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sale of Hilltop Office Center and a land parcel in Burlington, MA. Hilltop Office Center is not included in discontinued operations due
to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of this property after the sale.

Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest

Properties included in our gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 in the Total
Property Portfolio are shown below:



Minority interest in Operating Partnership

Minority interest in Operating Partnership increased $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to
2004. In connection with the special cash dividend paid to holders of common stock on October 31, 2005, holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate in the distribution on an as-converted basis with their regular February 2006
distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.1 million related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and
have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.1 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was partially offset by
a reduction in the minority interest in our Operating Partnership’s income allocation related to changes in the partnership’s ownership interests and an underlying change in allocable
income.

Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of
minority interest

In March 2005, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN 47”). FIN 47 clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement
obligation” as used in FASB Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on
a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. At December 31, 2005, we recognized a liability for the fair value of the asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $7.1 million, which amount is included
in “Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we have recognized the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is included in “Cumulative
Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2004 to the year ended December 31,

The table below shows selected operating
information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 102 properties, including two hotels and three properties in which we have joint venture interests, acquired or placed in-service
on or prior to January 1, 2003 and owned by us through December 31, 2004. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2003 or disposed of
on or prior to December 31, 2004. This table includes a reconciliation from Same Property Portfolio to Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the properties which were sold, acquired, placed in-service or repositioned for
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Our net property operating margins for the Total Property Portfolio, which are defined as rental revenue less operating expenses, exclusive of the two hotel properties, for the year ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, were 69.2% and 68.8%, respectively.



For a detailed
discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 41.



Rental Revenue

The increase of $90.0 million in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that represent our Total
Property Portfolio. Rental Revenue from Properties Acquired increased approximately $53.1 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $41.3 million, Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $2.1 million, Properties Sold
decreased approximately $4.4 million and Properties Repositioned decreased approximately $2.1 million.

Increased rental revenue from Properties Acquired relates to the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Discovery Square as of April 1,
2003, the remaining interests in One and Two Freedom Square as of August 5, 2003, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue on October 8, 2003, the remaining interest in 140 Kendrick Street as of March 24, 2004 and the acquisition of 1330 Connecticut
Avenue on April 1, 2004. These additions to the portfolio increased revenue by approximately $53.1 million, as detailed below:

In addition, the
placing into service of Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third quarter of 2004, as well as Shaws Supermarket and Waltham Weston Corporate Center during 2003, increased revenue by approximately $41.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as detailed below:

The increase in rental
revenue from the Same Property Portfolio reflects an increase in rental revenue, including operating income, parking and other income, of approximately $9.8 million offset by a decrease in straight-line rents of $7.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.



The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset due to the sale of Hilltop Office Center during 2004
and 2300 N Street during 2003. Due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of these properties through agreements with the buyers, the properties are not categorized as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. See also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue from properties sold decreased by approximately $4.4 million, as detailed below:

In September 2004, we
commenced the redevelopment of our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. Capital Gallery is a Class A office property totaling approximately 397,000 square feet. The project entails removing a three-story low-rise section of the property
comprised of 100,000 square feet from in-service status and developing it into a 10-story office building resulting in a total complex size of approximately 610,000 square feet upon completion. This property is included in Properties Repositioned
for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Rental revenue has decreased for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to taking the three-story low-rise section out of service in September 2004.

Termination Income

Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was related to
nineteen tenants across the portfolio that terminated their leases and made termination payments totaling approximately $4.0 million. This compared to termination income earned for the year ended December 31, 2003 related to nineteen tenants
totaling $6.1 million.

Operating Expenses

The increase of $22.4 million in property operating expenses in the Total
Property Portfolio (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that represent our Total Property Portfolio.
Operating expenses from Properties Acquired increased approximately $12.4 million, Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $6.2 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $5.0 million, and Properties Sold decreased
approximately $1.2 million.

Approximately $12.4 million of the
increase in Total Property Portfolio operating expenses primarily relates to the additions of One and Two Discovery Square, One and Two Freedom Square, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue, as detailed below:



Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $6.2 million. Included in
Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase to real estate tax expense of approximately $7.4 million due to increased real estate tax assessments, specifically in New York City. These increases were offset by a decrease of
approximately $1.2 million to insurance expense.

In addition,
the placing into service of Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third quarter of 2004, as well as Shaws Supermarket and Waltham Weston Corporate Center during 2003, increased operating expenses by
approximately $5.0 million, as detailed below:

The aggregate increase
in operating expenses was offset due to the sale of Hilltop Office Center during 2004 and 2300 N Street during 2003. Due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of these properties through agreements with the buyers, the
properties are not categorized as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Expenses from properties sold decreased by approximately $1.2 million, as
detailed below:

Hotel Net Operating Income

Net operating income for the hotel properties
increased by approximately $2.2 million, or approximately 14.83%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 net operating income for the Residence
Inn by Marriott

®

was included as part of income
from discontinued operations due to its sale on November 4, 2005.

The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. This information excludes the Residence Inn by Marriott

Development and Management Services

Our third-party fee income increased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended 2004 compared to 2003. Our third-party
fees in Washington, D.C. with National Institute of Health and in New York at 90 Church Street increased development services by an aggregate of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our management fees increased approximately $1.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003.

Interest and Other Income

Interest and
other income increased by $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. In the first quarter of 2004 we recognized a net amount of approximately $7.0 million in connection with the termination by a third-party of an agreement to enter into
a ground lease with us. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2004, we had a cash balance of approximately $239.3 million which also contributed to higher interest earnings.

Other Expenses

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses in the Total Property Portfolio increased by $8.3 million, or 18.25% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. An aggregate of approximately $1.8 million of the increase is attributable to changes in the form of long-term equity-based compensation, as further described below. During the fourth quarter we
exercised our right to terminate the purchase agreement to acquire the 21-acre site on the Boston waterfront known as Fan Pier. In conjunction with the termination, we recognized approximately $1.1 million of general and administrative expense
consisting of our share of the forfeited deposit of $0.8 million and approximately $0.3 million of related due diligence costs. In addition, we recognized an expense of $0.75 million representing our payment to Mr. Alan B. Landis, a former
director, in connection with the amendment to a development agreement. Other major increases during 2004 included the following: (1) increases in state taxes based on income and net worth of approximately $1.2 million; (2) increases of
approximately $0.8 million in professional fees in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as fees related to increased responsibilities of our Board of Directors; and (3) an increase of approximately $2.3 million related to bonuses and
salaries for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Commencing
in 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP unit is generally the
economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five-year term (for awards granted prior to 2003, vesting is in equal annual installments; for those granted in 2003 and beyond, vesting
is over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding
employee service period. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to “Stock-based compensation.” Stock-based compensation expense
associated with restricted stock was approximately $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Stock-based compensation expense associated with $6.1 million of restricted stock that was granted in January 2003 will generally be
expensed ratably as such restricted stock vests over a five-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $9.7 million granted in January 2004 and approximately $11.4 million granted in January 2005 of restricted stock
and LTIP units will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vest. To the extent we continue to grant restricted stock and LTIP awards, our expenses will continue to increase significantly until 2008 even if there are no
future increases in the aggregate value of restricted equity granted each year. This is because we expense the value of the restricted stock and LTIP awards ratably over the five-year vesting period and a full run-rate will not be achieved until
2008.



Interest Expense

Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $6.7 million. The majority of the
increases/decreases are due to (1) the cessation of interest capitalization at Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two, which collectively increased interest expense by approximately $7.2 million, and (2) the
acquisition of our remaining interests in 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue in the second quarter of 2004 and the acquisition of our remaining interest in one Freedom Square in the third quarter of 2003 which increased interest expense
by approximately $7.7 million. These increases were offset by (1) the refinancing of outstanding mortgage indebtedness at Reservoir Place in the second quarter of 2003 and 601 and 651 Gateway Boulevard in the third quarter of 2003 which
decreased interest expense by approximately $3.8 million, and (2) the net impact of replacing outstanding mortgage debt collateralized by properties using proceeds from our unsecured senior notes which decreased interest expense approximately
$1.3 million. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2004 compared with 2003.

Depreciation and
Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense for
the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Depreciation and amortization from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $19.4 million, Properties Acquired
increased approximately $12.5 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $8.5 million, Properties Repositioned increased approximately $3.1 million and Properties Sold decreased approximately $0.5 million.

The additions to the Total Property Portfolio through acquisitions increased
depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $12.5 million, as detailed below:



The additions to the Total Property Portfolio through placing properties in-service increased
depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $8.5 million, as detailed below:

In September 2004, we
commenced the redevelopment of our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. which is classified as Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2004. In connection with the redevelopment project, we recognized an accelerated
depreciation charge of approximately $2.6 million, which represents the net book value of the portion of the three-story, low-rise section of the building which is being redeveloped.

Capitalized Costs

Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real
estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized
wages for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $5.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $10.8 million and $19.2 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. During the third quarter of 2004, we placed in-service Times Square Tower and New Dominion
Technology Park, Building Two and ceased capitalizing interest in accordance with our capitalization policy.

Net Derivative Losses

Net derivative losses for the Total Property Portfolio represent the adjustments to fair value and cash settlements of a derivative contract that was not
effective for accounting purposes. The fair value of the derivative contract, which was $1.2 million at December 31, 2004, was included within our consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the expiration of this derivative contract in
February 2005, we have no further earnings volatility related to this contract. See Part II-Item 7A—“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”

Losses from early extinguishments of debt

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately
$6.3 million related to the repayments of our mortgage loans collateralized by One and Two Reston Overlook and the 12300 and 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive buildings. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recognized approximately $1.5 million
related to the early extinguishments of debt related to the repayment of the mortgage loan collateralized by 2300 N Street.

Joint Ventures

The decrease in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Total Property Portfolio is related to purchasing the remaining interests in 140 Kendrick
Street, One and Two Freedom Square and One and Two



Discovery Square. 140 Kendrick Street is included in the Total Property Portfolio as of March 24, 2004. One and Two Freedom Square are included in the
Total Property Portfolio as of August 5, 2003. One and Two Discovery Square are included in the Total Property Portfolio as of April 1, 2003. The reclassification of these properties caused the overall income from unconsolidated joint
ventures to decrease $3.8 million, which was offset by an increase in Same Property joint venture income of approximately $1.2 million. Included in our share of Same Property Portfolio joint venture income is termination income of approximately $1.8
million, of which our share is approximately $1.0 million earned in the second quarter of 2004.

Included in Joint Ventures acquired during 2004 is the Value-Added Fund. Approximately $0.2 million of initial organization costs was recognized,
resulting in a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest

The decrease in income from discontinued operations in the Total Property Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2004 was a result of properties sold or designated as held for sale during the end of 2004 and
2003 which are no longer included in our operations as of December 31, 2004. Below is a list of properties included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003:

Gains on sales of real estate
and other assets, net of minority interest

Gains on
the sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2004 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sale of Hilltop Office Center and a land parcel in Burlington, MA. Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31,
2003 primarily related to the sale of 2300 N Street. These properties are not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee equivalent to market, of these properties after the sales.

Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest

Properties included in our gains on sales of real
estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 in the Total Portfolio are shown below:



Minority interest in Operating Partnership

Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased approximately $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared to 2003. This increase was due to a reduction in the minority interest in our Operating Partnership’s income allocation related to changes in the
partnership’s ownership interests and an underlying increase in allocable income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to:

•

fund normal recurring expenses;

•

meet debt service requirements including the repayment or refinancing of $217.7 million of indebtedness that matures on or prior to March 1, 2007, $82.3 million of which is due
in 2006 and the remainder in the first quarter of 2007, as well as the early repayment of construction financing collateralized by Seven Cambridge Center totaling approximately $112.5 million on February 24, 2006;

•

fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs;

•

fund current development costs not covered under construction loans;

•

fund new property acquisitions; and

•

make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

We believe that these needs will be satisfied using cash on hand, cash flows
generated by operations and provided by financing activities, as well as cash generated from asset sales. Base rental revenue, recovery income from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances, draws on our unsecured line of credit
and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase
income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue
also include third-party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the
necessary funds for our short-term liquidity needs. However, material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant
improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes.

Our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the
costs of developments, possible property acquisitions, scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:

•

construction loans;

•

long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness;

•

income from operations;

•

income from joint ventures;

•

sales of real estate;

•

issuances of our equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in BPLP; and

•

our unsecured revolving line of credit or other short-term bridge facilities.



We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. Our unsecured line of credit
is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short-term development and working capital needs. We generally fund our development projects with construction loans that
may be partially guaranteed by BPLP, our Operating Partnership, until project completion or lease-up thresholds are achieved.

Cash Flow Summary

The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.

Cash and cash equivalents were $261.5 million and $239.3 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively, representing an
increase of $22.2 million. The increase was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows:

Our principal source
of cash flow is related to the operation of our office properties. The average term of our tenant leases is approximately 7.3 years with occupancy rates historically in the range of 92% to 98%. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream
of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. In addition, over the past year, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our
properties and raised proceeds from secured borrowings.

Cash
is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property
management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. Cash provided by investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 consisted of the following:

Cash used in financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled approximately $806.7 million. This consisted of payments of dividends and distributions to shareholders and the unitholders of our Operating Partnership, including the $2.50 per share
special distribution, which does not reflect the payment of approximately $12.1 million in February 2006 to holders of our Series Two Preferred Units representing their participation in the special dividend paid to holders of common stock in October
2005. Other factors include



changes to our existing debt structure, including the net repayment of certain mortgages as well as proceeds of approximately $45.0 million related to the
exercise of options by holders to purchase shares of common stock. Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading “Debt Financing.”

Capitalization

At December 31, 2005, our total consolidated debt was approximately $4.8 billion. The weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated
indebtedness was 6.39% and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.0 years.

Debt to total market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage
commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Our total market capitalization was approximately $15.1 billion at December 31, 2005. Total market capitalization was calculated using the December 30, 2005 closing stock price of $74.13 per
common share and the following: (1) 112,542,262 shares of our common stock, (2) 21,377,724 outstanding common units of limited partnership of BPLP (excluding common units held by Boston Properties, Inc.), (3) an aggregate of 4,857,395
common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding preferred units of partnership interest in BPLP, (4) an aggregate of 380,821 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP units, assuming all conditions have been met for
the conversion of the LTIP units, and (5) our consolidated debt totaling approximately $4.8 billion. Our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2005 represented approximately 31.87% of our total market capitalization. This percentage will
fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours,
whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the debt to total market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various
components of our outstanding indebtedness.

Debt Financing

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately
$4.8 billion of outstanding indebtedness, representing 31.87% of our total market capitalization as calculated above under the heading “Capitalization,” consisting of approximately $1.5 billion in publicly traded unsecured debt at an
average interest rate of 5.95% with maturities ranging from 2013 to 2015, $3.3 billion of property-specific debt, including $225.0 million of indebtedness under our unsecured line of credit, and approximately $58.0 million outstanding on our
unsecured line of credit. The table below summarizes our outstanding debt at December 31, 2005 and 2004:



The variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various spreads over the London Interbank
Offered Rate or Eurodollar rates. As of December 31, 2005, the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was LIBOR/Eurodollar plus 0.59% per annum.

Unsecured Line of Credit

On May 19, 2005, we modified our $605.0 million unsecured line of credit by extending the maturity date from January 17, 2006 to
October 30, 2007, with a provision for a one-year extension at our option, subject to certain conditions, and by reducing the per annum variable interest rate on outstanding balances from Eurodollar plus 0.70% to Eurodollar plus 0.65%. In
addition a facility fee equal to 15 basis point per annum is payable in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in BPLP’s senior unsecured debt ratings. The unsecured line of
credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to us at a reduced Eurodollar rate. We utilize the unsecured line of credit principally to fund development of properties,
land and property acquisitions, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and for working capital purposes. Our unsecured line of credit is a recourse obligation of BPLP.

Our ability to borrow under our unsecured line of credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial
and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including:

•

a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however for a single period of not more than five consecutive quarters the leverage ratio can exceed 60% (but may not exceed 65%);

•

a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%;

•

a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40;

•

an unsecured leverage ratio not to exceed 60%;

•

a minimum net worth requirement;

•

an unsecured interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75; and

•

restrictions on permitted investments, development, partially owned entities, business outside of commercial real estate and commercial non-office properties

We believe we are in compliance with the
financial and other covenants listed above.

At
December 31, 2005, we had letters of credit totaling $8.5 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit. On July 19, 2005, we refinanced $225 million of mortgage indebtedness at 599 Lexington Avenue through a secured draw on our
unsecured line of credit. As of December 31, 2005, we had the ability to borrow an additional $313.5 million under our unsecured line of credit. As of March 8, 2006 we have borrowings of $300 million outstanding under our unsecured line of
credit with the ability to borrow an additional $296.5 million under our unsecured line of credit.

Unsecured Senior Notes

The following summarizes the unsecured senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands):

(1)

Yield on issuance date including the effects of discounts on the notes.

(2)

No principal amounts are due prior to maturity.



Our unsecured senior notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal
to the greater of (1) 100% of their principal amount or (2) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at a rate equal to the yield on U.S. Treasury securities with a comparable
maturity plus 35 basis points (or 25 basis point in the case of the $250 million 12 Year Unsecured Senior Notes that mature on June 1, 2015), in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The indenture under which our
senior unsecured notes were issued contains restrictions on incurring debt and using our assets as security in other financing transactions and other customary financial and other covenants, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%,
(2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of 1.5, and (4) unencumbered asset value to be no less than 150% of our unsecured debt. As of December 31, 2005 we were in compliance with each
of these financial restrictions and requirements.

BPLP’s
investment grade ratings on its senior unsecured notes are as follows:

Unsecured Bridge Loan

On September 25, 2002, we obtained unsecured bridge financing totaling
$1.0 billion in connection with the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue. During January 2003, we repaid the remaining $105.7 million under our unsecured bridge loan with proceeds from the January 2003 offering of senior unsecured notes.

Mortgage Debt

At December 31, 2005, our total consolidated debt was approximately
$4.8 billion. The weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 6.39% and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.0 years. At December 31, 2005, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loans
on Times Square Tower, our Seven Cambridge Center project and our Capital Gallery Redevelopment project and mortgage indebtedness at 599 Lexington Avenue through a secured draw on our unsecured line of credit. Variable rate debt constituted 18.11%
of our total debt as of December 31, 2005. We plan on financing our larger development properties with property-specific construction debt because of the time associated with the development of those properties and we plan on utilizing our
unsecured line of credit for other transactions as they occur.



The following table sets forth certain information regarding our mortgage notes payable at
December 31, 2005:

(1)

The mortgage financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.50% per annum.

(2)

On July 19, 2005, we repaid the mortgage loan through a secured draw on our unsecured line of credit. As of December 31, 2005, the interest rate on this draw under our

intend to repay this financing upon the maturity date of the existing financing of $50.7 million at Capital Gallery upon its maturity in August 2006.

(12)

On January 31, 2006, we repaid the mortgage loan collateralized by this property.

Combined aggregate principal payments of mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2005 are as follows (in thousands):

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and
interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable
rates. The fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term fixed rate non-recourse debt of similar duration. We continue to follow a
conservative strategy of pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. Approximately 81.89% of our outstanding debt has fixed interest
rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging
transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows
imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy protects us against future increases in interest rates.

During 2005 we entered into twelve forward-starting interest rate swap contracts which fix the 10-year treasury rate for a financing in February 2007 at a
weighted average rate of 4.34% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $500.0 million. The swaps go into effect in February 2007 and expire in February 2017. We obtained the swaps to lock in the 10-year treasury rate and 10-year swap spread
in contemplation of obtaining long-term fixed-rate financing to refinance existing debt that is expiring or freely prepayable prior to February 2007. We expect to settle the interest rate swaps in cash at the time we close
on the long-term fixed-rate financing. Each swap contract provides for a fixed 10-year LIBOR swap rate (the fixed strike rate) ranging from



4.562% per annum to 5.016% per annum. If the 10-year LIBOR swap rate is below the fixed strike rate at the time we settle each
swap, we would be required to make a payment to the swap counter-parties; if the 10-year LIBOR swap rate is above the fixed strike rate at the time we cash settle each swap, we would receive a payment from the swap
counter-parties. The amount that we either pay or receive will equal the present value of the basis point differential between the applicable fixed strike rate and the 10-year swap rate at the time we settle each swap. We
believe that these swaps qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. We intend to consider entering into additional
hedging arrangements to minimize our interest rate risk.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we had a derivative contract in a notional amount of $150 million. Prior to the modification described below, the derivative contract provided for a fixed interest rate of 6.35% when LIBOR is less
than 5.80%, 6.70% when LIBOR is between 6.70% and 7.45%, and 7.50% when LIBOR is between 7.51% and 9.00% through February 2005. In August 2003, we modified the contract to provide for the counter party to pay us LIBOR and we were required to pay the
counter party LIBOR in arrears plus 4.55% per annum on the notional amount of $150 million. The derivative contract expired in February 2005. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the derivative agreement is reflected at its fair market value,
which was a liability of $1.2 million at December 31, 2004.

At December 31, 2005, our outstanding variable rate debt based off LIBOR totaled approximately $874.1 million. At December 31, 2005, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 4.96%. If market interest rates
on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

At December 31, 2004, our outstanding variable rate debt based off LIBOR totaled approximately $424 million. At
December 31, 2004, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 3.36%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $4.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004.

These amounts were
determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis
assumes no changes in our financial structure.

Funds from Operations

Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from
Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), we calculate Funds from Operations, or “FFO,” by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP,
including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use
of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more
meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets
and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of
a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current
NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amounts represent of our share, which was 83.74%, 82.97%, 82.06%, 81.98% and 81.23% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.



In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO, as
adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2003, 2002 and 2001 which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts and
early lease surrender payments.

The adjustment to exclude
losses from early extinguishments of debt results when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debt’s stated maturity and to write-off unamortized loan costs at the date of the
extinguishment. Such costs are excluded from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP. However, we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost
of the sale transactions because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions. We believe that this supplemental adjustment more
appropriately reflects the results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions.

The adjustments for net derivative losses related to non-qualifying derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
resulted from interest rate contracts we entered into prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to variable rate debt associated with real estate projects under development.
Upon transition to SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, the impacts of these contracts were recorded in current earnings, while prior to that time they were capitalized. Although these adjustments were attributable to a single hedging program,
the underlying contracts extended over multiple reporting periods and therefore resulted in adjustments from the first quarter of 2001 through the third quarter of 2003. Management presents FFO before the impact of non-qualifying derivative
contracts because economically this interest rate hedging program was consistent with our risk management objective of limiting our exposure to interest rate volatility and the change in accounting under GAAP did not correspond to a substantive
difference. Management does not currently anticipate structuring future hedging programs in a manner that would give rise to this kind of adjustment.

The adjustments for early lease surrender for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 resulted from a unique lease transaction related to the
surrender of space by a tenant that was accounted for as a termination for GAAP purposes and recorded in income at the time the space was surrendered. However, we continued to collect payments monthly after the surrender of space through the month
of July 2002, the date on which the terminated lease would otherwise have expired under its original terms. Management presents FFO after the early surrender lease adjustment because economically this transaction impacted periods subsequent to the
time the space was surrendered by the tenant and, therefore, recording the entire amount of the lease termination payment in a single period made FFO less useful as an indicator of operating performance. Although these adjustments are attributable
to a single lease, the transaction impacted multiple reporting periods and resulted in adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Although our FFO, as adjusted, clearly differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate
companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that, by excluding the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, adjustments
for non-qualifying derivative contracts and early lease surrender payments, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting
FFO.

Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, should be considered as
an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of
liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO, as adjusted, should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in
accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.



The following table presents a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to FFO and
FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001:

(1)

Real estate depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation and amortization from the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $266,829, $249,649, $206,686, $176,412 and
$140,197, our share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization of $8,554, $6,814, $8,475, $8,955 and $5,410, and depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations of $812, $3,292, $3,791, $10,016 and $9,966,
less corporate related depreciation and amortization of $1,719, $2,436, $2,717, $2,809 and $2,023 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(2)

Excludes approximately $12.1 million of income allocated to the holders of Series Two Preferred Units to account for their right to participate on an as-converted basis in the
special dividend that followed previously completed sales of real estate.



Reconciliation to Diluted Funds from Operations:

(1)

Our share of diluted funds from operations was 84.60%, 84.01%, 83.45%, 83.79% and 83.49% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Excludes approximately $12.1 million of income allocated to the holders of Series Two Preferred Units to account for their right to participate on an as-converted basis in the
special dividend that followed previously completed sales of real estate.



Net Operating Income

Net operating income, or “NOI,” is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure, plus minority interest in Operating Partnership, net derivative losses, losses from early extinguishments of debt, losses on investments in securities, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of
minority interest), preferred dividends, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued
operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interests in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and
management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items
that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.

Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is
useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis,
providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property’s results of operations. For example, interest expense is
not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful
life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs and real estate companies that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear
understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or
to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.

The following sets forth a reconciliation of NOI to net income available to common shareholders for the fiscal years 2001 through 2005.



Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2005, we were subject to contractual payment obligations as described in the table below.

(1)

Committed tenant-related obligations based on executed leases as of December 31, 2005 (tenant improvements and lease commissions).

We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related
to our property management. In addition, we have certain other utility contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year and that vary based on usage. These contracts include terms that provide for
cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally one year or less.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Joint Ventures

We have investments in
seven unconsolidated joint ventures (including our investment in the Value-Added Fund) with our effective ownership interests ranging from 23.89% to 51%, all of which have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not
control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2005, our share of the debt related to these investments was
equal to approximately $212.2 million. The table below summarizes our share of the outstanding debt (based on our respective ownership interests) of these joint venture properties at December 31, 2005:

(1)

The mortgage financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.10% per annum and requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.



(2)

This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund. The mortgage financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.89% per annum and requires interest only payments
with a balloon payment due at maturity. This mortgage matures in December 2007, with two one-year extension options. In addition, the Value-Added Fund entered into an agreement to cap the interest rate at 9.5% for a nominal fee.

(3)

Amount represents construction financing of up to $96.5 million, of which our maximum share is $23.1 million, at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum with a
maturity in March 2009. The mortgage debt requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. We have guaranteed approximately $4.6 million of the total construction loan amount on behalf of the land and infrastructure entity.

(4)

In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rates shown were adjusted to reflect the fair value of the note using an effective interest rate of 4.38% per
annum. This note is non-interest bearing and matures in January 2008. The weighted average rates exclude the impact of this loan. We have agreed, together with our third-party joint venture partners to guarantee this seller financing on behalf of
the land and infrastructure entity.

(5)

Amount represents construction financing comprised of a $60.0 million loan commitment (of which our share is $30.0 million) which bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.73% per
annum and a $35.0 million loan commitment (of which our share is $17.5 million) which bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum. The financing converts to a ten-year fixed rate loan in October 2007 at an interest rate of
5.73% per annum with a provision for an increase in the borrowing capacity by $35.0 million (of which our share would be $17.5 million). The conversion is subject to conditions which we expect to satisfy. As of December 31, 2005 the
interest rate on the variable rate portion of the debt was 5.62% per annum. The weighted average rate as of December 31, 2005 is reflected in the table.

(6)

This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund. The mortgage financing bears interest at a fixed rate and requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.

Environmental Matters

It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct
or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental
assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions
with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory
filings, as well as remedial action.

In February 1999, we
(through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater
contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property
acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases
and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no
assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.

Environmental investigations at two of our properties in Massachusetts have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source
properties. In both cases we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments and to prepare submittals to the state regulatory authority, including Downgradient Property Status Opinions.
The environmental consultant



concluded that the properties qualify for Downgradient Property Status under the state regulatory program, which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting
response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory amendments regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source
properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). Other than periodic testing, no such additional response
actions are anticipated at this time.

We own a property in
Massachusetts where historic groundwater contamination was identified prior to acquisition. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform investigations and to prepare necessary submittals to the state regulatory authority. The
environmental consultant has concluded that (1) certain identified groundwater contaminants are migrating to the subject property from an off-site source property and (2) certain other detected contaminants are likely related to a historic
release on the subject property. We have filed a Downgradient Property Status Opinion (described above) with respect to contamination migrating from off-site and a Response Action Outcome (“RAO”) with respect to the identified historic
release. The RAO indicates that regulatory closure has been achieved and that no further action is required at this time.

Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or
current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with
development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and
extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the
property. We own a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility, which we may develop in the future. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have engaged
a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. We anticipate that additional response actions
necessary to achieve regulatory closure (if any) will be performed prior to or in connection with future development activities. When appropriate, closure documentation will be submitted for public review and comment pursuant to the state regulatory
authority’s public information process.

We expect that
resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental
liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.

Newly Issued Accounting Standards-

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections – A Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS Statement No. 3” (“SFAS No. 154”). SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in
accounting principle by requiring retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of the change in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in depreciation or
amortization for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 to have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.



In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) regarding EITF 04-5, “Investor’s Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights” (“EITF 04-5”). The
conclusion provides a framework for addressing the question of when a sole general partner, as defined in EITF 04-5, should consolidate a limited partnership. Pursuant to EITF 04-5, the general partner of a limited partnership should consolidate a
limited partnership unless the limited partners have either (a) the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause, or (b) substantive participating rights. In addition, EITF
04-5 concluded that the guidance should be expanded to include all limited partnerships, including those with multiple general partners. EITF 04-5 became effective on June 29, 2005 for all agreements entered into or modified after June 29,
2005. For pre-existing agreements that have not been modified, EITF 04-05 is effective for reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of EITF 04-5 to have a material impact on our cash
flows, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN 47”). FIN 47 clarifies that the term
“conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in FASB Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or
method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing
and/or method of settlement. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The fair value of a liability for the
conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred—generally upon the acquisition, construction, or development and/or through the normal operation of an asset. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient
information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 became effective and we adopted it on December 31, 2005. Certain of our real estate assets contain asbestos. Although the asbestos is
appropriately contained, in accordance with current environmental regulations, our practice is to remediate the asbestos upon the renovation or redevelopment of its properties. At December 31, 2005, we have recognized a liability for the
fair value of the asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $7.1 million, which amount is included in “Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we have recognized the
cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is included in “Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
year ended December 31, 2005.

Inflation

Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and
operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent
increases and operating expense escalations.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Approximately $4.0 billion of our borrowings bear interest at fixed rates, and therefore the fair value of these instruments
is affected by changes in the market interest rates. The following table presents our aggregate fixed rate debt obligations with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by maturity date and our aggregate variable rate debt obligations
sorted by maturity date. The weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of December 31, 2005 was 4.96%.

During 2005 we entered
into twelve forward-starting interest rate swap contracts which fix the 10-year treasury rate for a financing in February 2007 at a weighted average rate of 4.34% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $500.0 million. The swaps go into
effect in February 2007 and expire in February 2017. We obtained the swaps to lock in the 10-year treasury rate and 10-year swap spread in contemplation of obtaining long-term fixed rate financing to refinance existing debt that is expiring or
freely prepayable prior to February 2007. We expect to settle the interest rate swaps in cash at the time we close on the long-term fixed-rate financing. Each swap contract provides for a fixed 10-year LIBOR swap rate (the fixed
strike rate) ranging from 4.562% per annum to 5.016% per annum. If the 10-year LIBOR swap rate is below the fixed strike rate at the time we settle each swap, we would be required to make a payment to the swap
counter-parties; if the 10-year LIBOR swap rate is above the fixed strike rate at the time we cash settle each swap, we would receive a payment from the swap counter-parties. The amount that we either pay or receive will equal
the present value of the basis point differential between the applicable fixed strike rate and the 10-year swap rate at the time we settle each swap. We believe that these swaps qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. We intend to consider entering into additional hedging arrangements to minimize our interest rate risk.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over

Financial Reporting

Management of Boston Properties, Inc. (“the Company”) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As of the
end of the Company’s 2005 fiscal year, management conducted assessments of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on these assessments, management has determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 was effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the
directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report appearing on pages 79 and 80, which
expresses unqualified opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Boston Properties, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of Boston Properties, Inc.’s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of
its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions on
Boston Properties, Inc.’s 2005, 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements and on its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Properties, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 19 to the financial statements, in the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.”

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing on page 78, that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.



A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Organization and Basis of Presentation

Organization

Boston
Properties, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”). The Company is the sole general partner of Boston Properties Limited Partnership (the
“Operating Partnership”) and at December 31, 2005 owned an approximate 80.9% (80.3% at December 31, 2004) general and limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. Partnership interests in the Operating Partnership
are denominated as “common units of partnership interest” (also referred to as “OP Units”), “long term incentive units of partnership interest” (also referred to as “LTIP Units”) or “preferred units of
partnership interest” (also referred to as “Preferred Units”).

Unless specifically noted otherwise, all references to OP Units exclude units held by the Company. A holder of an OP Unit may present such OP Unit to the Operating Partnership for redemption at any time (subject to
restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such redemption right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, the Operating
Partnership must redeem such OP Unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of common stock of the Company (“Common Stock”). In lieu of a cash redemption, the Company may elect to acquire such OP Unit for one share of Common Stock.
Because the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at all times equals the number of OP Units that the Company owns, one share of Common Stock is generally the economic equivalent of one OP Unit, and the quarterly distribution that may be paid
to the holder of an OP Unit equals the quarterly dividend that may be paid to the holder of a share of Common Stock. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of restricted common stock of the Company. LTIP Units, whether vested
or not, will receive the same quarterly per unit distributions as OP Units, which equal per share dividends on Common Stock (See Note 16).

At December 31, 2005, there was one series of Preferred Units outstanding (i.e., Series Two Preferred Units). The Series Two Preferred Units bear a
distribution that is set in accordance with an amendment to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Preferred Units may also be converted into OP Units at the election of the holder thereof or the Operating Partnership in accordance
with the amendment to the partnership agreement (See also Note 10).

All references to the Company refer to Boston Properties, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires.

Properties

At December 31, 2005, the Company owned or had interests in a portfolio
of 121 commercial real estate properties (125 properties at December 31, 2004) (the “Properties”) aggregating approximately 42.0 million net rentable square feet (approximately 44.1 million net rentable square feet at
December 31, 2004), including three properties under construction and one redevelopment/expansion project collectively totaling approximately 1.1 million net rentable square feet and structured parking for approximately 30,152 vehicles
containing approximately 9.3 million square feet. At December 31, 2005, the Properties consist of:

•

117 office properties, including 100 Class A office properties (including three properties under construction) and 17 Office/Technical properties;

•

two hotels; and

•

two retail properties.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company owns or controls undeveloped land parcels totaling approximately 527.1 acres. In
addition, the Company has a 25% interest in the Boston Properties Office Value-Added Fund, L.P. (the “Value-Added Fund”), which is a strategic partnership with two institutional investors through which the Company intends to pursue the
acquisition of value-added investments in assets within its existing markets. The Company’s investments through the Value-Added Fund are not included in its portfolio information or any other portfolio level statistics. At December 31,
2005, the Value-Added Fund had investments in an office complex in Herndon, Virginia and an office property in Chelmsford, Massachusetts.

The Company considers Class A office properties to be centrally located buildings that are professionally managed and maintained, that attract
high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings. The Company considers Office/Technical properties to be properties that support office, research and
development and other technical uses. Net rentable square feet amounts are unaudited.

Basis of Presentation

Boston Properties, Inc. does not have any other significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its investment in the Operating Partnership, nor does it have employees of its own. The Operating Partnership, not Boston Properties,
Inc., executes all significant business relationships. All majority-owned subsidiaries and affiliates over which the Company has financial and operating control and variable interest entities (“VIE”s) in which the Company has determined it
is the primary beneficiary are included in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company accounts for all other unconsolidated joint ventures using
the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the Company’s share of the earnings of these joint ventures and companies is included in consolidated net income.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”). In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which amended FIN 46. FIN 46R was effective immediately for
arrangements entered into after January 31, 2003, and became effective during the first quarter of 2004 for all arrangements entered into before February 1, 2003. FIN 46R requires existing unconsolidated VIEs to be consolidated by their
primary beneficiaries. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses or receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are
the ownership interests, contractual interests, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests. Prior to FIN 46R, the Company included an entity in
its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests. The adoption and application of FIN 46 and FIN 46R has not had a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Real Estate

Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of
acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, “above-” and “below-market” leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations”), and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value
and buildings at replacement cost. The Company assesses and considers fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of
factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The Company
also considers an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing
relationship with the tenants, the tenant’s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on its acquisitions to date, the Company’s allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.

The Company records acquired “above-” and “below-market”
leases at their fair value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and
(2) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market
fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Company’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease. Factors to be
considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes real estate taxes, insurance
and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, the Company considers leasing commissions, legal
and other related expenses.

The Company reviews its long-lived
assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If
such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding
future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Because cash flows on properties considered to be “long-lived assets to be held and used,” as defined by SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” (“SFAS No. 144”) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, the Company’s established
strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases, but does not eliminate, the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If the Company’s strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an
impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date.

SFAS No. 144, which was adopted on January 1, 2002, requires
that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as “held for sale,” be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to
be eliminated and the Company will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the property’s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of
the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). The Company generally considers assets to be “held for sale” when the transaction has been approved by the
Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as “held for
sale,” no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.

A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After
determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must
cease involves a degree of judgement. The Company’s capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 “Capitalization of Interest Cost” and SFAS No. 67 “Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental
Operations of Real Estate Properties.” The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development
costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for
occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. The Company ceases capitalization on the portion(s) substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy,
and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion(s) under construction. Interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $5.7 million, $10.8 million and $19.2 million, respectively. Salaries and
related costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $3.9 million, $4.4 million and $3.7 million, respectively.

The acquisitions of minority interests (i.e., OP Units) for shares of the Company’s common stock are recorded under the purchase method with assets
acquired reflected at the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of acquisition. The acquisition amounts are allocated to the underlying assets based on their estimated fair values.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as
incurred. Significant betterments are capitalized. When assets are sold or retired, their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses reflected in net income or loss for the period.

The Company computes depreciation and amortization on
properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, the Company allocates the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired “above-” and
“below-market” leases, origination costs and acquired in-place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciates or amortizes these assets (or liabilities) over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired
“above-” and “below-market” leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the assets as follows:

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on
hand and investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit of $100,000. The Company has not experienced any losses to date on its invested cash.

Cash Held in Escrows

Escrows include amounts established pursuant to various agreements for security deposits, property taxes, insurance and other costs.

Investments in Securities

The Company accounts for investments in securities of publicly traded companies in accordance with SFAS No. 115
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Investments.” Investments in securities of non-publicly traded companies are recorded at cost, as they are not considered marketable under SFAS No. 115. At December 31, 2005
and 2004, the Company had insignificant investments in securities.

Tenant and other receivables

Tenant and other
accounts receivable, other than accrued rents receivable, are expected to be collected within one year.

Deferred Charges

Deferred charges include leasing costs and financing fees. Leasing costs include an allocation for acquired intangible in-place lease values and direct
and incremental fees and costs incurred in the successful negotiation of leases, including brokerage, legal, internal leasing employee salaries and other costs which have been deferred and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms
of the respective leases. Internal leasing salaries and related costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $2.0 million, $1.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively. External fees and costs incurred to obtain
long-term financing have been deferred and are being amortized over the terms of the respective loans on a basis that approximates the effective interest method and are included with interest expense. Unamortized financing and leasing costs are
charged to expense upon the early repayment or significant modification of the financing or upon the early termination of the lease, respectively. Fully amortized deferred charges are removed from the books upon the expiration of the lease or
maturity of the debt.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint
Ventures

Except for ownership interests in a variable
interest entity, the Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because it exercises significant influence over, but does not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at
cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the balance sheet and the underlying
equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, the net equity investment of the Company is reflected within the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the Company’s share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among
investors for profits and losses, however, the Company’s recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture’s distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return
thresholds. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, the Company consolidates those in which it is the primary beneficiary.

To the extent that the Company contributes assets to a joint venture, the Company’s investment in joint venture is recorded at the Company’s
cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that the Company’s cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related
asset and included in the Company’s share of equity in net income of the joint venture. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 78-9 “Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures,” the Company will recognize
gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner’s interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

Equity Offering Costs

Underwriting commissions and offering costs have been reflected as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.

Treasury Stock

The Company’s share repurchases are reflected as treasury stock
utilizing the cost method of accounting and are presented as a reduction to consolidated stockholders’ equity. The Company did not repurchase any of its shares during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Dividends

Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to
stockholders, will differ from income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal income tax purposes in the treatment of gains on the sale of real property, revenue and expense recognition, compensation expense, and
in the estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation.

The tax treatment of common dividends per share for federal income tax purposes is as follows (unaudited):

(1)

Includes special dividend of $2.50 per common share paid on October 31, 2005.

Revenue Recognition

Base rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. The impact of the straight-line rent adjustment
increased revenue by approximately $66.0 million, $61.3 million and $48.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, as the revenue recorded exceeded amounts billed. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, the
Company recognizes rental revenue of acquired in-place “above-” and “below-market” leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets,
represents rental income earned in excess of rent payments received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. The Company maintains an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential tenant credit losses. The credit
assessment is based on the estimated accrued rental income that is recoverable over the term of the lease. The Company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required
rent payments. The computation of this allowance is based on the tenants’ payment history and current credit status, as well as certain industry or geographic specific credit considerations. If the Company’s estimates of collectibility
differ from the cash received, then the timing and amount of the Company’s reported revenue could be impacted. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of the Company’s existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenant’s
risk profiles prior to lease execution and continual monitoring of the Company’s portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real
estate taxes and other recoverable costs are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with EITF Issue 99-19 “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus
Net as an Agent” (“Issue 99-19”). Issue 99-19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded gross, as the Company is generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third- party suppliers, has
discretion in selecting the supplier and has credit risk.

The
Company’s hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long-distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel
revenues are recognized as earned.

The Company receives
management and development fees from third parties. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the
collection of rents. The Company reviews each development agreement and records development fees on a straight-line basis or percentage of completion depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint
venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners’ ownership interest.

The Company recognizes gains on sales of real estate pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66 “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.” The
specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the property. If the sales
criteria are not met, the Company defers gain recognition and accounts for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.

Interest Expense and Interest Rate Protection Agreements

From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate protection
agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt or in anticipation of issuing fixed rate debt. The fair value of these agreements is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of
these agreements would be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations if the agreements were not effective for accounting purposes.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders, as adjusted for unallocated earnings (if
any) of certain securities issued by the Operating Partnership, by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from shares issuable under stock-based
compensation plans, including upon the exercise of stock options, and conversion of the minority interests in the Operating Partnership.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, escrows, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable
estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments.

For purposes of disclosure, the Company calculates the fair value of mortgage debt and unsecured senior notes. The Company discounts the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest

payments on mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, the Company adds its estimation of a
market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to its debt.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1997. As a result, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders. A REIT is subject to a number of
organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income. The Company’s policy is to distribute 100% of its taxable income. Accordingly, the only provision for
federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the Company’s consolidated taxable REIT subsidiaries. The Company’s taxable REIT subsidiaries did not have significant tax provisions or deferred income
tax items.

In January 2002, the Company formed a taxable REIT
subsidiary (“TRS”), IXP, Inc. (IXP) which acts as a captive insurance company and is one of the elements of its overall insurance program. The accounts of IXP are consolidated within the Company. IXP is a captive TRS that is subject to tax
at the federal and state level. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a tax provision in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Effective July 1, 2002, the Company restructured the leases with respect
to its ownership of the three hotel properties by forming a TRS. The hotel TRS, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is the lessee pursuant to leases for each of the hotel properties. As lessor, the Operating Partnership is
entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel properties. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel properties under the Marriott

®

name and under terms of the existing management agreements. In connection with the restructuring, the revenue and
expenses of the hotel properties are being reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The hotel TRS is subject to tax at the federal and state level and, accordingly, the Company has recorded a tax provision in the
Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The net difference between the tax basis and the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities is approximately $1.5 billion as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Certain entities included in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements are subject to certain state and local taxes. These taxes are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The following reconciles GAAP net income to taxable income:

Stock-based employee compensation plan

At December 31, 2005, the Company has stock-based employee compensation
plans. Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123,” using the modified prospective application method
for stock compensation awards. In addition, effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted early SFAS No. 123 (revised) (“SFAS No. 123R”), “Share-Based Payment,” which revised the fair value based method of
accounting for share-based payment liabilities, forfeitures and modifications of stock-based awards and clarified SFAS No. 123’s guidance in several areas, including measuring fair value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability
and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods. In 2003, the Company transitioned to granting restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options, as its primary vehicle for employee equity compensation under its
stock-based employee compensation plan. The Company had previously accounted for its stock-based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of the Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations. All outstanding options had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, and all outstanding options are currently
exercisable. As a result, the following table only illustrates the effect on net income available to common shareholders and earnings per common share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions to stock-based employee
compensation for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Use of Estimates in
the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include such items as depreciation and allowances for doubtful accounts. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Real estate consisted of the following at December 31 (in thousands):

Acquisitions

On December 30, 2005, the Company acquired Prospect
Place, a Class A office property with approximately 297,000 net rentable square feet located in Waltham, Massachusetts, at a purchase price of approximately $62.8 million. The acquisition was financed with available cash.

Dispositions

On February 23, 2005, the Company sold a parcel of land at the
Prudential Center located in Boston, Massachusetts for a net sale price of approximately $31.5 million and an additional obligation of the buyer to fund an estimated $18.6 million of future costs at the Prudential Center (of which approximately
$18.5 million has been received as of December 31, 2005) for aggregate proceeds of $50.1 million. Due to the structure of the transaction and certain continuing involvement provisions related to the development of the property, this transaction
does not qualify as a sale for financial reporting purposes and has been accounted for as a financing transaction. Under the financing method, the cost of real estate and other assets totaling approximately $46.0 million continues to be reflected
within the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and the cash received from the buyer totaling approximately $50.0 million has been recorded in “Other liabilities” within the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. At such time as the
continuing involvement provisions expire or otherwise are terminated, the Company will record the transaction as a sale for financial reporting purposes and the gain on sale will be recognized in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66
“Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.”

On
February 28, 2005, the Company sold Decoverly Four and Five, consisting of two undeveloped land parcels located in Rockville, Maryland for net cash proceeds of approximately $5.3 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $1.2

5.    Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

The investments in unconsolidated joint ventures consists of the following
at December 31, 2005:

(1)

This joint venture is accounted for under the equity method due to participatory rights of the outside partner.

(2)

The Company’s economic ownership can increase based on the achievement of certain return thresholds.

(3)

The property is not in operation (i.e., under construction).

(4)

Represents the Company’s effective ownership interest. The Company has a 66.67%, 5% and 0% interest in the office, retail and residential joint venture entities, respectively,
which each own a 33.33% interest in the entity developing and owning the land and infrastructure of the project.

Certain of the Company’s joint venture agreements include provisions whereby, at certain specified times, each partner has the right to initiate a
purchase or sale of its interest in the joint ventures at an agreed upon fair value. Under these provisions, the Company is not compelled to purchase the interest of its outside joint venture partners.

On March 8, 2005, the Company entered into the 505 9

th

Street joint venture with an unrelated third party to develop a build-to-suit Class A office building totaling 323,000
net rentable square feet at 505 9th Street in Washington, D.C. The joint venture partner contributed the land for a 50% interest. The joint venture subsequently entered into a 15-year lease with a law firm to occupy 230,000 net rentable square feet
of the building. On September 26, 2005, the joint venture commenced construction on the project. In conjunction with the commencement of construction, the Company’s Operating Partnership issued 253,860 OP Units and cash of approximately
$4.9 million to the owners of its joint venture partner as consideration for the Company’s 50% interest in the joint venture.

On March 11, 2005, the Wisconsin Place joint venture entity, which owns and is developing the land and infrastructure components of the project (the
“Land and Infrastructure Entity”), obtained construction financing totaling $96.5 million collateralized by the Wisconsin Place development project in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Wisconsin Place is a mixed-use development project consisting of
office, retail and residential properties. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum and matures in March 2009 with a one-year extension option. The Company has guaranteed approximately
$4.6 million of the loan amount on behalf of the Land and Infrastructure Entity.

On January 1, 2005, the Company placed-in-service 901 New York Avenue, a 539,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in Washington, D.C., in which the Company has a 25% interest.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

On December 9, 2005, the Company withdrew as a member of the New Jersey & H Street LLC
joint venture. The Company no longer has an interest in the joint venture and its initial capital contribution of approximately $3.0 million was returned to the Company.

On December 14, 2005, the joint venture entity that is developing 505 9th Street in Washington, D.C. closed on a
collateralized, construction-to-permanent financing totaling $95.0 million. The construction financing is comprised of a $60.0 million loan commitment, which bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.73% per annum, and a $35.0 million loan
commitment, which bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum. The construction financing converts to a ten-year fixed rate loan in October 2007, subject to the satisfaction of certain operating performance and
financial measures, at an interest rate of 5.73% per annum with a provision for an increase in the borrowing capacity by $35.0 million (which would bring the total available financing to $130.0 million).

On December 20, 2005, the Company’s Value-Added Fund acquired 300
Billerica Road, a 111,000 net rentable square foot office property located in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, at a purchase price of approximately $10.0 million. The acquisition was financed with new mortgage indebtedness totaling $7.5 million and
approximately $2.5 million in cash, of which the Company’s share was approximately $0.6 million. The mortgage financing bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.69% per annum and matures on January 1, 2016.

The combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint
ventures is as follows (in thousands):

(1)

The Company and its partner in the 901 New York Avenue venture had agreed to guarantee up to $3.0 million and $9.0 million, respectively, of mortgage financing on behalf of the
joint venture entity. The joint venture partner had pledged cash for its $9.0 million guarantee. The guarantees were released by the lender in April 2005.

The Company and its third-party joint venture partners in the Wisconsin Place ventures have guaranteed the seller financing
totaling $23.5 million related to the acquisition of the land by the Land and Infrastructure Entity. The fair value of the Company’s stand-ready obligation related to the issuance of this guarantee is immaterial. In addition, the Company has
agreed to guarantee up to approximately $4.6 million of the construction loan on behalf of the Land and Infrastructure Entity.

(2)

This amount represents the aggregate difference between the Company’s historical cost basis reflected and the basis reflected at the joint venture level, which is typically
amortized over the life of the related asset. Basis differentials occur primarily upon the transfer of assets that were previously owned by the Company into a joint venture. In addition, certain acquisition, transaction and other costs may not be
reflected in the net assets at the joint venture level.

6.    Mortgage
Notes Payable

The Company had outstanding mortgage notes
payable totaling approximately $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, each collateralized by one or more buildings and related land included in real estate assets. The mortgage notes payable are generally
due in monthly installments and mature at various dates through August 1, 2021.

Fixed rate mortgage notes payable totaled approximately $2.5 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, with interest rates ranging from 5.55% to 8.59% (averaging 7.15% and 7.00% at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively).

Variable rate
mortgage notes payable (including construction loans payable) totaled approximately $816.1 million and $423.8 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, with interest rates ranging from 0.32% to 1.65% above the London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) in 2005 and ranging from 0.90% to 1.00% above LIBOR in 2004. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the LIBOR rate was 4.39% and 2.40%, respectively.

On February 17, 2005, the Company obtained construction financing of up to $47.2 million collateralized by the Capital
Gallery property in Washington, D.C. Capital Gallery is a Class A office property currently totaling approximately 397,000 net rentable square feet. The purpose of the financing is to fund a portion of the cost of an expansion project at the
property. The expansion project entails removing a three-story low-rise section of the property comprised of 100,000 net rentable square feet from in-service status and redeveloping it into a ten-story office building. Upon completion, the total
complex size will approximate 610,000 net rentable square feet. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.65% per annum and matures in February 2008. At December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on
the construction loan facility was $17.2 million. The construction financing is provided by the same lender as the existing mortgage loan collateralized by the property, which, at December 31, 2005, had an outstanding principal balance of
approximately $50.7 million and bears interest at a fixed rate equal to 8.24% per annum with a maturity in August 2006. The agreement with the lender provides an extension provision for the existing mortgage loan to coincide with the February
2008 maturity date of the construction financing.

On April 12, 2005, the Company obtained construction financing of up to $125.0 million
collateralized by its Seven Cambridge Center development project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Seven Cambridge Center is a fully-leased, build-to-suit project with approximately 231,000 net rentable square feet of office, research laboratory
and retail space plus parking for approximately 800 cars. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum and matures in April 2007 with a one-year extension option. At December 31, 2005,
the outstanding balance on the construction loan facility was $98.9 million.

In connection with the sale of the Old Federal Reserve on April 20, 2005, the Company modified the mortgage loans collateralized by Embarcadero Center One, Two and the Old Federal Reserve properties totaling
approximately $293.8 million. The modification consisted solely of the release of the Old Federal Reserve property from the collateral in exchange for the payment of a release fee totaling approximately $0.6 million. As the modification was not
considered substantial, the Company has amortized the release fee and remaining unamortized deferred financing costs over the remaining term of the modified mortgage loans using the effective interest method.

On May 12, 2005, the Company modified its $83.8 million mortgage loan
collateralized by 601 and 651 Gateway Boulevard located in South San Francisco, California. The loan required monthly payments equal to the net cash flow from the property which was allocated first to interest based on a rate of 3.50% per annum
with the remainder applied to principal. The loan was scheduled to mature in September 2006 with an option held by the lender, subject to certain conditions, to extend the term to October 2010. If extended, the loan was to require payments of
principal and interest at a fixed interest rate of 8.00% per annum based on a 27-year amortization period. The loan provided for the payment of contingent interest up to a maximum of $10.8 million, under certain circumstances, during the
extension period. The modified mortgage loan of $83.8 million matured on December 31, 2005 and continued to require monthly payments equal to the net cash flow from the property, which were allocated first to interest based on a rate of
3.50% per annum with the remainder applied to principal, through the end of the term, with a balloon payment due at maturity. In addition, the Operating Partnership had guaranteed the repayment of the mortgage loan. The Company had not
recognized any gain or loss as a result of the modification, and had accounted for the modified terms prospectively. On December 30, 2005, the Company repaid at maturity the outstanding balance on the mortgage loan totaling approximately $85.7
million.

In connection with the sale of 100 East Pratt Street
on May 12, 2005, the Company repaid the mortgage loans collateralized by the property totaling approximately $84.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling
approximately $6.7 million, consisting of prepayment fees of approximately $6.5 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $0.2 million. The mortgage loans bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.73% per annum
and were scheduled to mature in November 2008.

In connection
with the sale of Riverfront Plaza on May 16, 2005, the Company repaid the mortgage loan collateralized by the property totaling approximately $104.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a loss from early
extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $4.3 million, consisting of a prepayment fee. The mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.61% per annum and was scheduled to mature in February 2008.

On June 21, 2005, the Company refinanced its construction loan facility
collateralized by Times Square Tower located in New York City. The original construction loan facility totaled $475.0 million and was comprised of two tranches. The first tranche consisted of a $300.0 million loan commitment bearing interest at
LIBOR plus 0.90% per annum and maturing in January 2006. The first tranche included a provision for a one-year extension at the option of the Company. The second tranche consisted of a $175.0 million term loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus
1.00% per annum and maturing in January 2007. On June 21, 2005, the



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

outstanding balance under the construction loan facility was $448.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a loss from
early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $1.8 million, consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. The new mortgage loan totaling $475.0 million bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.50% per
annum and matures on July 9, 2008. The new mortgage loan includes provisions for two one-year extensions at the option of the Company. In addition, the Company entered into an agreement to cap the interest rate at 10.5% per annum.

On July 19, 2005, the Company refinanced at maturity its
mortgage loan collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue located in New York City. The mortgage loan totaling $225.0 million bore interest at a fixed rate of 7.00% per annum. The mortgage loan was refinanced through a $225.0 million secured draw
from the Company’s revolving credit facility.

On
October 4, 2005, the Company repaid the mortgage loan collateralized by its Embarcadero Center West Tower property located in San Francisco, California totaling approximately $90.7 million using approximately $72.7 million of available cash and
$18.0 million drawn under the Company’s Unsecured Line of Credit. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. The mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.50% per annum and was scheduled to mature on
January 1, 2006.

During 2005, the Company entered into
forward-starting interest rate swap contracts which fix the ten-year treasury rate for a financing in February 2007 at a weighted-average rate of 4.34% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $500.0 million. The swaps go into effect in
February 2007 and expire in February 2017. The Company entered into the interest rate swap contracts designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedges to reduce its exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the
Treasury rate in contemplation of obtaining ten-year fixed-rate financing in early 2007. SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS No. 133”), as amended and interpreted,
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments. The Company has formally documented all of its relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedging instrument’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. All components of the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. At December 31, 2005, derivatives with a fair value
of $6.2 million were included in Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and derivatives with a fair value of $0.2 million were included in Other Liabilities within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has recorded the changes in
fair value of the swap contracts related to the effective portion of the interest rate contracts totaling approximately $6.0 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount
of hedge ineffectiveness was not material. The accumulated comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to interest expense over the term of the forecasted fixed-rate debt. The Company does not expect to reclassify any amounts recorded within
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relating to the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts within the next twelve months.

Four mortgage loans totaling $250.6 million and $257.3 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, have been accounted for at their fair
values on the date the mortgage loans were assumed. The impact of using this accounting method decreased interest expense by $3.2 million, $2.7 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
cumulative liability related to these accounting methods was $20.8 million and $24.1 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and is included in mortgage notes payable.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Combined aggregate principal payments of mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2005 are as
follows:

7.    Unsecured
Senior Notes

The following summarizes the unsecured senior
notes outstanding as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands):

(1)

Yield on issuance date including the effects of discounts on the notes.

(2)

No principal amounts are due prior to maturity.

The indenture relating to the unsecured senior notes contains certain financial restrictions and requirements, including (1) a leverage ratio not to
exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of greater than 1.50, and (4) an unencumbered asset value of not less than 150% of unsecured debt. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
Company was in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements.

8.    Unsecured Line of Credit

On May 19, 2005, the Company modified its $605.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Unsecured Line of Credit”) by extending the maturity date from January 17, 2006 to October 30, 2007, with a
provision for a one-year extension at the option of the Company, subject to certain conditions, and by reducing the per annum variable interest rate on outstanding balances from Eurodollar plus 0.70% to Eurodollar plus 0.65% per annum. Under
the Unsecured Line of Credit, a facility fee equal to 15 basis points per annum is payable in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in the Operating Partnership’s unsecured
debt ratings. The Unsecured Line of Credit involves a syndicate of lenders. The Unsecured Line of Credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to the Company at a
reduced Eurodollar rate. For those lenders that participated in both the original facility and the modified facility, the initial direct debt issuance costs and the



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

costs incurred with the modification are being amortized over the new term of the facility. For the lender that did not participate in the modification, the
Company has reflected the write-off of the unamortized initial direct debt issuance costs as an extinguishment of debt, which did not have a significant impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company had an outstanding
balance on the Unsecured Line of Credit of $283.0 million at December 31, 2005, of which $225.0 million is collateralized by the Company’s 599 Lexington Avenue property and therefore is included in Mortgage Notes Payable in the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. There was no outstanding balance at December 31, 2004. The weighted-average balance outstanding was approximately $107.3 million (including the $225.0 million collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue)
and $19.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on amounts outstanding was approximately 4.32% and 1.83% during the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The terms of the Unsecured Line of Credit require that the
Company maintain a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however for a single period of not more than five consecutive quarters the leverage ratio can exceed
60% (but may not exceed 65%), (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%, (3) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40, (4) an unsecured leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (5) a minimum net worth requirement,
(6) an unsecured interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75 and (7) limitations on permitted investments, development, partially owned entities, business outside of commercial real estate and commercial non-office properties. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company was in compliance with each of these financial and other covenant requirements.

9.    Commitments and Contingencies

General

In the normal course of business, the Company guarantees its performance of services or indemnifies third parties against its negligence.

The Company has letter of credit and performance obligations of approximately
$15.5 million related to lender and development requirements.

The Company and its third-party joint venture partners have guaranteed the seller financing totaling $23.5 million related to the acquisition of the land by the WP Project Developer LLC, the Land and Infrastructure Entity of the Wisconsin
Place joint venture entities. In addition, the Company has agreed to guarantee up to approximately $4.6 million of the construction loan on behalf of WP Project Developer LLC.

The Company had agreed to guarantee up to $3.0 million of mortgage financing on behalf of its 901 New York Avenue joint
venture entity. The guarantee was released by the lender in April 2005.

The Company’s agreement for its Citigroup Center consolidated joint venture includes a provision whereby, after a certain specified time, the joint venture partner has the right to initiate a purchase or sale of its interest in the
joint venture. Under this provision, the Company is compelled to purchase, at fair value, the joint venture partner’s interest. Certain of the Company’s other joint venture agreements include provisions whereby, at certain specified times,
each partner has the right to initiate a purchase or sale of its interest in the joint ventures. Under these other provisions, the Company is not compelled to purchase the interest of its outside joint venture partners.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Management of the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of tenants and
may require tenants to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees and/or other financial guarantees. Although the



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Company’s properties are geographically diverse and the tenants operate in a variety of industries, to the extent the Company has a significant
concentration of rental revenue from any single tenant, the inability of that tenant to make its lease payments could have an adverse effect on the Company.

Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.

The Company carries insurance coverage on its properties of types and in amounts and with deductibles that it believes are in line with coverage
customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. In response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, was enacted in November 2002
to require regulated insurers to make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the statute) through December 31, 2004, which date was extended to December 31, 2005 by the United States Department of Treasury on
June 18, 2004 and which date was further extended to December 31, 2007 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (the “TRIA Extension Act”). TRIA expires on December 31, 2007, and the Company cannot currently
anticipate whether it will be extended. Effective as of March 1, 2006, the Company’s property insurance program per occurrence limits were decreased from $1 billion to $800 million, including coverage for both “certified” and
“non-certified” acts of terrorism by TRIA. The amount of such insurance available in the market has decreased because of the natural disasters which occurred during 2005. The Company also carries nuclear, biological and chemical terrorism
insurance coverage (“NBC Coverage”) for “certified” acts of terrorism as defined by TRIA, which is provided by IXP, Inc. as a direct insurer. Effective as of March 1, 2006, the Company extended the NBC Coverage to
March 1, 2007, excluding the Company’s Value-Added Fund properties. Effective as of March 1, 2006, the per occurrence limit for NBC Coverage was decreased from $1 billion to $800 million. Under TRIA, after the payment of the required
deductible and coinsurance the NBC Coverage is backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a “program trigger.” Under the TRIA Extension Act (a) the
program trigger is $5 million through March 31, 2006, $50 million from April 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 and $100 million from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007 and (b) the coinsurance is 10%
through December 31, 2006 and 15% through December 31, 2007. The Company may elect to terminate the NBC Coverage when the program trigger increases on January 1, 2007, if there is a change in its portfolio or for any other reason. The
Company intends to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable.

The Company also currently carries earthquake insurance on its properties located in areas known to be subject to
earthquakes in an amount and subject to self-insurance that the Company believes are commercially reasonable. In addition, this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. Specifically, the Company
currently carries earthquake insurance which covers its San Francisco portfolio with a $120 million per occurrence limit and a $120 million aggregate limit, $20 million of which is provided by IXP, Inc., as a direct insurer. The amount of the
Company’s earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. As a result of increased costs of coverage and limited availability, the amount of third-party earthquake insurance that the Company may be able to
purchase on commercially reasonable terms may be reduced. In addition, the Company may discontinue earthquake insurance on some or all of its properties in the future if the premiums exceed the Company’s estimation of the value of the coverage.

In January 2002, the Company formed a wholly-owned taxable
REIT subsidiary, IXP, Inc., or IXP, to act as a captive insurance company and be one of the elements of the Company’s overall insurance program. IXP acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of the Company’s earthquake insurance
coverage for its Greater San Francisco properties and the Company’s NBC Coverage for “certified acts of terrorism” under TRIA. Insofar as the Company owns IXP, it is responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the
accounts of IXP are part of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by the



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Company’s NBC Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any
backstop by the Federal Government. If the Company experiences a loss and IXP is required to pay under its insurance policy, the Company would ultimately record the loss to the extent of IXP’s required payment. Therefore, insurance coverage
provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance.

The Company continues to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism in particular,
but the Company cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars or the presence of mold at the Company’s properties, for which the
Company cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, if the Company experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy
limits, the Company could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that the Company could
be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition and results of operations.

Legal Matters

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in
the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. Management believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of
the Company.

State and Local Tax Matters

Because the Company is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally
not subject to federal income taxes, but is subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which the Company owns real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits.
Although the Company believes that it has substantial arguments in favor of its positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax
deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

Environmental Matters

It is the Company’s policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos
surveys in connection with the Company’s acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its business, assets,
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the Company is not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to its properties that the Company believes would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to
time environmental conditions at the Company’s properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action.

In February 1999, the Company (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was
formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. The Company developed an office park on the property. The Company engaged a
specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability
arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to the Company’s ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply
with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify the Company for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the
indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.

Environmental investigations at two of the Company’s properties in Massachusetts have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site
source properties. In both cases the Company engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments and to prepare submittals to the state regulatory authority, including Downgradient Property
Status Opinions. The environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify for Downgradient Property Status under the state regulatory program, which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. The Company also
believes that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory amendments regarding upgradient releases. Although the Company believes that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility
for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, the Company will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). Other than periodic testing, no such additional response actions are anticipated at
this time.

The Company owns a property in Massachusetts where
historic groundwater contamination was identified prior to acquisition. The Company engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform investigations and to prepare necessary submittals to the state regulatory authority. The
environmental consultant has concluded that (1) certain identified groundwater contaminants are migrating to the subject property from an off-site source property and (2) certain other detected contaminants are likely related to a historic
release on the subject property. The Company has filed a Downgradient Property Status Opinion (described above) with respect to contamination migrating from off-site and a Response Action Outcome (“RAO”) with respect to the identified
historic release. The RAO indicates that regulatory closure has been achieved and that no further action is required at this time.

Some of the Company’s properties and certain properties owned by the Company’s affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously
developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design
features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is the Company’s
practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. The Company then uses this information as part of its decision-making process with respect
to the acquisition and/or development of the property. The Company owns a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility, which the Company may develop in the future. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site
contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. The Company has engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an
environmental risk characterization. The Company anticipates that additional response actions necessary to achieve regulatory closure (if any) will be performed prior to or in connection with future development activities. When appropriate, closure
documentation will be submitted for public review and comment pursuant to the state regulatory authority’s public information process.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company expects that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have
a material impact on its business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, the Company cannot assure you that it has identified all environmental liabilities at its properties, that all necessary remediation actions
have been or will be undertaken at the Company’s properties or that the Company will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.

Tax Protection Obligations

The Operating Partnership Agreement provides that, until June 23, 2007, the Operating Partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer three
designated properties (or a property acquired pursuant to the disposition of a designated property in a non-taxable transaction) in a taxable transaction without the prior written consent of Mr. Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Chairman of the Board
of Directors, and Mr. Edward H. Linde, President and Chief Executive Officer. The Operating Partnership is not required to obtain their consent if each of them does not hold at least 30% of their original interests in the Operating
Partnership, or if those properties are transferred in a non-taxable event.

In connection with the acquisition or contribution of 26 properties, the Company entered into similar agreements for the benefit of the selling or contributing parties which specifically state that until specified
dates ranging from November 2006 to April 2016, or such time as the contributors do not hold at least a specified percentage of the OP Units owned by such person following the contribution of the properties, the Operating Partnership will not sell
or otherwise transfer the properties in a taxable transaction. If the Company does sell or transfer the properties in a taxable transaction, it would be liable to the contributors for contractual damages.

10.    Minority Interests

Minority interests relate to the interest in the Operating Partnership not
owned by the Company and interests in property partnerships not wholly-owned by the Company. As of December 31, 2005, the minority interest in the Operating Partnership consisted of 21,377,724 OP Units, 380,821 LTIP Units and 3,701,335 Series
Two Preferred Units (or 4,857,395 OP Units on an as converted basis) held by parties other than the Company.

The minority interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity interests in the ventures that own Citigroup Center and the office entity at
Wisconsin Place. These ventures are consolidated with the financial results of the Company because the Company exercises control over the entities that own the properties. The equity interests in the ventures that are not owned by the Company,
totaling approximately $18.0 million and $26.9 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively, are included in Minority Interests on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The minority interest holder’s share
of income for Citigroup Center is reflective of the Company’s preferential return on and of its capital.

During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, 381,000 and 1,318,327 Series Two Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership, respectively, were
converted by the holders into 500,000 and 1,730,088 OP Units, respectively. The OP Units were subsequently presented by the holders for redemption and were redeemed by the Company in exchange for an equal number of shares of Common Stock. The
aggregate book value of the Preferred Units that were converted, as measured for each Preferred Unit on the date of its conversion, was approximately $13.2 million and $43.6 million, respectively. The difference between the aggregate book value and
the purchase price of these Preferred Units was approximately $22.3 million and $40.2 million, respectively, which increased the recorded value of the Company’s net assets. In addition, the Company paid the accrued preferred distributions due
to the holders of Preferred Units that were converted.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Preferred Units at December 31, 2005 consist solely of 3,701,335 Series Two Preferred Units,
which bear a preferred distribution equal to the greater of (1) the distribution which would have been paid in respect of the Series Two Preferred Unit had such Series Two Preferred Unit been converted into an OP Unit (including both regular
and special distributions) or (2) an increasing rate, ranging from 5.00% to 7.00% per annum (7.00% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003) on a liquidation preference of $50.00 per unit, and are convertible into OP Units
at a rate of $38.10 per Preferred Unit (1.312336 OP Units for each Preferred Unit). Distributions to holders of Preferred Units are recognized on a straight-line basis that approximates the effective interest method.

On July 21, 2005, Boston Properties, Inc., as general partner of the
Operating Partnership, declared a special cash distribution on the OP Units and LTIP Units in the amount of $2.50 per unit which was paid on October 31, 2005 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2005. The
special cash distribution was in addition to the regular quarterly distributions of $0.65, $0.68, $0.68 and $0.68 per unit which were declared by Boston Properties, Inc., as general partner of the Operating Partnership, during the year ended
December 31, 2005.

Holders of Series Two Preferred Units
participated in the special cash distribution on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular February 2006 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement. As a result, the Company accrued
approximately $12.1 million related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.1 million, which amount has been reflected in
Minority Interest in Operating Partnership within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005.

On September 26, 2005, the Operating Partnership issued 253,860 OP Units to the owners of its joint venture partner as consideration for the
Company’s 50% interest in the joint venture which is developing 505 9th Street in Washington, D.C.

11.    Stockholders’ Equity

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had 112,542,262 shares of Common Stock outstanding.

On July 21, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a special cash dividend of $2.50 per share of Common Stock which was paid on
October 31, 2005 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2005. The special cash dividend is in addition to the regular quarterly dividends of $0.65, $0.68, $0.68 and $0.68 per share of Common Stock which were
declared by the Company’s Board of Directors during the year ended December 31, 2005.

On March 3, 2004, the Company completed a public offering of 5,700,000 shares of its Common Stock at a price to the public of $51.40 per share. The
proceeds from this public offering, net of underwriters’ discount and offering costs, totaled approximately $291.0 million.

During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company issued 924,976 and 2,540,452 shares of its Common Stock, respectively, in connection
with the redemption of an equal number of OP Units.

During the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company issued 1,270,436 and 3,815,074 shares of its Common Stock, respectively, upon the exercise of options to purchase Common Stock by certain employees.

12.    Future Minimum Rents

The Properties are leased to tenants under net operating leases with initial term expiration dates ranging from 2006 to
2029. The future minimum lease payments to be received (excluding operating expense reimbursements) by the Company as of December 31, 2005, under non-cancelable operating leases (including leases for properties under development), which expire
on various dates through 2029, are as follows:

No single tenant
represented more than 10.0% of the Company’s total rental revenue for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

13.    Segment Reporting

The Company’s segments are based on the Company’s method of internal reporting which classifies its operations by both geographic area and
property type. The Company’s segments by geographic area are Greater Boston, Greater Washington, D.C., Midtown Manhattan, Greater San Francisco and New Jersey. Segments by property type include: Class A Office, Office/Technical and Hotels.

Asset information by segment is not reported because the
Company does not use this measure to assess performance. Therefore, depreciation and amortization expense is not allocated among segments. Interest and other income, development and management services, general and administrative expenses, interest
expense, depreciation and amortization expense, net derivative losses, losses from early extinguishments of debt, minority interests in property partnerships, income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in Operating Partnership,
gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest) and cumulative effect of
a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest) are not included in Net Operating Income as the internal reporting addresses these items on a corporate level.

Net Operating Income is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as measured by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and it is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. All companies may not calculate Net
Operating Income in the same manner. The Company considers Net Operating Income to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of the Company’s
properties.

14.    Earnings Per Share

Earnings per share (“EPS”) has been computed pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 128. The following table
provides a reconciliation of both the net income and the number of common shares used in the computation of basic EPS, which is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. During 2004, the Company adopted EITF 03-6 “Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB 128” (“EITF 03-6”), which provides further guidance on the definition of participating
securities. Pursuant to EITF 03-6, the Operating Partnership’s Series Two Preferred Units, which are reflected as Minority Interests in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, are considered participating securities and are included in
the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share of the Company if the effect of applying the if-converted method is dilutive. The terms of the Series Two Preferred Units enable the holders to obtain OP Units of the Operating Partnership, as
well as Common Stock of the Company. Accordingly, for the reporting periods in which the Operating Partnership’s net income is in excess of distributions paid on the OP Units, LTIP Units and Series Two Preferred Units, such income is allocated
to the OP Units, LTIP Units and Series Two Preferred Units in proportion to their respective interests and the impact is included in the Company’s consolidated basic and diluted earnings per share computation due to its holding of the Operating
Partnership’s securities. Prior periods of the Company have been restated to conform to the provisions of EITF 03-6. There were no amounts required to be allocated to the Series Two Preferred Units for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004. For the year ended December 31, 2003, approximately $6.2 million was allocated to the Series Two Preferred Units in excess of distributions paid during the reporting period and is included in the Company’s computation of basic and
diluted earnings per share. Other potentially dilutive common shares, including securities of the Operating Partnership that are exchangeable for the Company’s Common Stock, and the related impact on earnings, are considered when calculating
diluted EPS.

15.    Employee
Benefit Plan

Effective January 1, 1985, the
predecessor of the Company adopted a 401(k) Savings Plan (the “Plan”) for its employees. Under the Plan, as amended, employees, as defined, are eligible to participate in the Plan after they have completed three months of service. Upon
formation, the Company adopted the Plan and the terms of the Plan.

Effective January 1, 2000, the Company amended the Plan by increasing the Company’s matching contribution to 200% of the first 3% from 200% of the first 2% of participant’s eligible earnings contributed (utilizing earnings
that are not in excess of $200,000, indexed for inflation) and by eliminating the vesting requirement. The Company’s matching contribution for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $2.1 million, $2.2 million and $1.9
million, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2001, the
Company amended the Plan to provide a supplemental retirement contribution to employees who have at least ten years of service on January 1, 2001, and who are 40 years of age or older as of January 1, 2001. The maximum supplemental
retirement contribution will not exceed the annual



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

limit on contributions established by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company will record an annual supplemental retirement credit for the benefit of each
participant. The Company’s supplemental retirement contribution and credit for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $189,000, $167,000 and $164,000, respectively.

The Company also maintains a deferred compensation plan that is designed to
allow officers of the Company to defer a portion of their current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals. The Company’s obligation under the plan is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred
compensation to the plan participants in the future. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company has funded approximately $4.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively, into a separate account, which is not restricted as to its use. The
Company’s liability under the plan is equal to the total amount of compensation deferred by the plan participants and earnings on the deferred compensation pursuant to investments elected by the plan participants. The Company’s liability
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $4.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, which are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

16.    Stock Option and Incentive Plan and Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has established a stock option and incentive plan for the purpose of attracting and retaining qualified
employees and rewarding them for superior performance in achieving the Company’s business goals and enhancing stockholder value.

Under the plan, the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance is 14,699,162 shares plus as of the first day of each calendar quarter after
January 1, 2000, 9.5% of any net increase since the first day of the preceding calendar quarter in the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, on a fully converted basis (excluding Preferred Stock). At December 31, 2005, the
number of shares available for issuance under the plan was 4,173,728.

Options granted under the plan became exercisable over a two-, three- or five-year period and have terms of ten years, as determined at the time of the grant. All options were granted at the fair market value of the Company’s Common
Stock at the dates of grant. All outstanding options vested on January 17, 2005.

The Company issued 12,317, 32,585 and 175,303 shares of restricted stock and 211,408, 166,430 and 3,408 LTIP Units under the plan during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The shares
of restricted stock were valued at approximately $714,250 ($57.99 per share weighted-average), $1.6 million ($49.88 per share weighted-average) and $6.2 million ($35.23 per share weighted-average) for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. LTIP Units issued during 2005 were valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. LTIP Units for the year ended December 31, 2005 were valued at approximately $10.5 million. The
weighted-average per unit fair value of LTIP Unit grants in 2005 was $49.59. The per unit fair value of each LTIP Unit granted in 2005 was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions; an expected life of eight years, a risk-free
interest rate of 3.96% and an expected price volatility of 20%. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 LTIP Units were valued at approximately $8.3 million ($49.82 per share weighted-average) and $0.1 million ($41.05 per share),
respectively. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of restricted stock in the Company. The aggregate value of the LTIP Units is not included in Unearned Compensation within Stockholders’ Equity as such securities are
those of the Operating Partnership and have been included in Minority Interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five-year term. Restricted stock and LTIP Units are measured at fair value
on the date of grant based on the number of shares or units granted, as adjusted for forfeitures, and the price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant as quoted



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. Dividends paid on both vested
and unvested shares of restricted stock are charged directly to Earnings in Excess of Dividends in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock and LTIP Units was approximately $6.4 million, $4.0
million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, in accordance with the modified prospective application transition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, the Company has recognized compensation
expense of approximately $50,000 relating to its unvested stock options for the year ended December 31, 2005.

In connection with the declaration of the special cash dividend of $2.50 per share of Common Stock paid on October 31, 2005 to shareholders of record
on September 30, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors approved adjustments to all its outstanding stock option awards that were intended to ensure that its employees, directors and other persons who held such stock options were not
disadvantaged by the special cash dividend. The exercise prices and number of all outstanding options were adjusted such that each option had the same fair value to the holder before and after giving effect to the payment of the special cash
dividend. Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, no compensation cost has been recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in connection with such adjustments. As a result, effective as of the close of business on
September 27, 2005, 4,325,656 outstanding stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $38.96 were adjusted to 4,481,864 outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $37.61. There were no other adjustments to the
terms of the outstanding stock option awards.

A summary of the
status of the Company’s stock options as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and changes during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are presented below:

In addition, the
Company had 5,196,166 and 7,570,655 options exercisable at weighted-average exercise prices of $38.11 and $35.14 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company adopted the 1999 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Stock Purchase Plan”) to encourage
the ownership of Common Stock by eligible employees. The Stock Purchase Plan became effective on January 1, 1999 with an aggregate maximum of 250,000 shares of Common Stock available for issuance. The Stock Purchase Plan provides for eligible
employees to purchase at the end of the biannual purchase periods shares of Common Stock at a purchase price equal to 85% of the average closing prices of the Common Stock during the last ten business days of the purchase period. The Company issued
7,492, 11,125 and 12,383 shares with the weighted average purchase price equal to $56.56 per share, $41.54 per share and $33.24 per share under the Stock Purchase Plan as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. The Company’s share of compensation cost under SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, for the stock performance-based plan would have been $1.6 million
and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Had compensation cost for the Company’s grants for stock-based compensation plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS
No. 148, the Company’s net income, and net income per common share for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 would approximate the pro forma amounts below:

18.    Discontinued Operations

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets that are to be disposed
of by sale be measured at the lesser of (1) book value or (2) fair value less cost to sell. In addition, it requires that one accounting model be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of
discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions.

Due to the Company’s continuing involvement in the management, for a
fee, of the 100 East Pratt Street, Riverfront Plaza, Embarcadero Center West Tower, Hilltop Office Center and 2300N Street properties through agreements with the buyers, these properties are not categorized as discontinued operations in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result, the gains on sales related to these properties have been reflected under the caption “Gains on sales of real estate and other assets, net of minority interest,” in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has presented the other properties listed above as discontinued operations in its Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, as applicable.

The Company’s application of SFAS No. 144 results in the presentation of the net operating
results of these qualifying properties sold during 2005, 2004 and 2003, as income from discontinued operations for all periods presented. In addition, SFAS No. 144 results in the gains on sale of these qualifying properties totaling
approximately $47.7 million (net of minority interests share of $9.4 million), $27.3 million (net of minority interests share of $9.6 million) and $73.2 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $16.5 million) to be reflected as gains
on sales of real estate from discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The application of SFAS No. 144 does not have an impact on
net income available to common shareholders. SFAS No. 144 only impacts the presentation of these properties within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

19.    Newly Issued Accounting Standards

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections—A Replacement of
APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS Statement No. 3” (“SFAS No. 154”). SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring retrospective application
to prior periods’ financial statements of the change in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in depreciation or amortization for long-lived, non-financial assets be
accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The
Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 to have a material impact on the Company’s cash flows, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) regarding EITF
04-5, “Investor’s Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights” (“EITF 04-5”). The conclusion provides a framework for
addressing the question of when a sole general partner, as defined in EITF 04-5, should consolidate a limited partnership. Pursuant to EITF 04-5, the general partner of a limited partnership should consolidate a limited partnership unless the
limited partners have either (a) the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause, or (b) substantive participating rights. In addition, EITF 04-5 concluded that the
guidance should be expanded to include all limited partnerships, including those with multiple general partners. EITF 04-5 became effective on June 29, 2005 for all agreements entered into or modified after June 29, 2005. For pre-existing
agreements that have not been modified, EITF 04-05 is effective for reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 04-5 to have a material impact on the Company’s cash
flows, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN 47”). FIN 47 clarifies that the term
“conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in FASB Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or
method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing
and/or method of settlement. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The fair value of a liability for the
conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred—generally upon the acquisition, construction, or development and/or through the normal operation of an asset. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient
information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 became effective and was adopted by the Company on December 31, 2005. Certain of the Company’s real estate assets contain
asbestos. Although the asbestos is appropriately

encapsulated, in accordance with current environmental regulations, the Company’s practice is to remediate the asbestos upon the renovation or
redevelopment of its properties. At December 31, 2005, the Company has recognized a liability for the fair value of the asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $7.1 million, which amount is included in “Accounts Payable
and Accrued Expenses” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company has recognized the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is included in “Cumulative
Effect of A Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest” on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. The pro forma effects of retroactively applying FIN 47 are as
follows:

The Company paid Applied Printing
Technologies, a printing company affiliated with Mr. Mortimer B. Zuckerman, approximately $67,000, $53,000 and $79,000 during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for printing services principally relating
to the printing of the Company’s annual report to shareholders.

An entity controlled by Mr. Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, owned an office building located at 2400 N Street, N.W. in Washington, D.C., in which a company affiliated with
Mr. Zuckerman leased 100% of the building. The Company had entered into an agreement with an entity controlled by Mr. Zuckerman to manage this property on terms comparable with other third-party property management agreements that the
Company currently has in place. The disinterested members of the Company’s Board of Directors had approved the management agreement between the Company and Mr. Zuckerman’s affiliate. Under the management agreement, the Company had
also agreed to provide consulting services and assistance in connection with a possible sale of this property in exchange for a fee of $100,000 payable upon the closing of the sale of the property. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, the Company received approximately $329,000, $777,000 and $681,000, respectively, for reimbursements of building operating costs and earned $66,000, $135,000 and $111,000, respectively, in management fees under the management agreement.
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the entity controlled by Mr. Zuckerman closed on the sale of the property and pursuant to the management agreement the Company received and recognized $100,000 for consulting services and assistance
in connection with the sale.

The Company had a lease with
Daily News LP (an entity controlled by Mr. Zuckerman) for office space located at Sumner Square. The Company and Daily News LP agreed to terminate the lease as of September 30, 2003 subject to another unrelated tenant within the building
executing an amendment to its existing lease pursuant to which it would agree to lease the office space through December 31, 2005. Daily News LP paid the Company $49,214 in lease termination fees. The disinterested directors of the
Company’s Board of Directors approved the lease termination. Daily News LP paid the Company an aggregate of $131,183 in 2003, including the aforementioned termination fees.

its arrangement with CBRE, Turchin & Associates has confirmed to the Company that it is paid on the same basis with respect to properties owned by the Company as it is with respect to properties owned by other clients of CBRE.
Mr. Turchin does not participate in any discussions or other activities relating to the Company’s contractual arrangements with CBRE either in his capacity as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors or as a Vice Chairman of CBRE.

On June 30, 1998, the Company acquired from entities
controlled by Mr. Alan B. Landis a portfolio of properties known as the Carnegie Center Portfolio and Tower Center One and related operations and development rights (collectively, the “Carnegie Center Portfolio”). In connection
with the acquisition of the Carnegie Center Portfolio, the Operating Partnership entered into a development agreement (the “Development Agreement”) with affiliates of Mr. Landis providing for up to approximately 2,000,000 square feet
of development in or adjacent to the Carnegie Center office complex. An affiliate of Mr. Landis was entitled to a purchase price for each parcel developed under the Development Agreement calculated on the basis of $20 per rentable square foot
of property developed. Another affiliate of Mr. Landis was eligible to earn a contingent payment for each developed property that achieves a stabilized return in excess of a target annual return ranging between 10.5% and 11%. The Development
Agreement also provided that upon negotiated terms and conditions, the Company and Mr. Landis would form a development company to provide development services for these development projects and would share the expenses and profits, if any, of
this new company. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of the Carnegie Center Portfolio, Mr. Landis became a director of the Company pursuant to an Agreement Regarding Directorship, dated as of June 30, 1998, with the Company
(the “Directorship Agreement”). Under the Directorship Agreement, the Company agreed to nominate Mr. Landis for re-election as a director at each annual meeting of stockholders of the Company in a year in which his term expires,
provided that specified conditions are met.

On
October 21, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement (the “2004 Agreement”) to modify several provisions of the Development Agreement. Under the terms of the 2004 Agreement, the Operating Partnership and affiliates of
Mr. Landis amended the Development Agreement to limit the rights of Mr. Landis and his affiliates to participate in the development of properties under the Development Agreement. Among other things,



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Mr. Landis agreed that (1) Mr. Landis and his affiliates will have no right to participate in any entity formed to acquire land parcels or the
development company formed by the Operating Partnership to provide development services under the Development Agreement, (2) Mr. Landis will have no right or obligation to play a role in development activities engaged in by the development
company formed by the Operating Partnership under the Development Agreement or receive compensation from the development company and (3) the affiliate of Mr. Landis will have no right to receive a contingent payment for developed
properties based on stabilized returns. In exchange, the Company (together with the Operating Partnership) agreed to:

•

effective as of June 30, 1998, pay Mr. Landis $125,000 on January 1 of each year until the earlier of (A) January 1, 2018, (B) the termination of the
Development Agreement or (C) the date on which all development properties under the Development Agreement have been conveyed pursuant to the Development Agreement, with $750,000, representing payments of this annual amount from 1998 to 2004,
being paid upon execution of the 2004 Agreement; and

•

pay an affiliate of Mr. Landis, in connection with the development of land parcels acquired under the Development Agreement, an aggregate fixed amount of $10.50 per rentable
square foot of property developed (with a portion of this amount (i.e., $5.50) being subject to adjustment, in specified circumstances, based on future increases in the Consumer Price Index) in lieu of a contingent payment based on stabilized
returns, which payment could have been greater or less than $10.50 per rentable square foot of property developed.

The Operating Partnership also continues to be obligated to pay an affiliate of Mr. Landis the purchase price of $20 per rentable square foot of
property developed for each land parcel acquired as provided in the original Development Agreement. During the 20-year term of the Development Agreement, until such time, if any, as the Operating Partnership elects to acquire a land parcel, an
affiliate of Mr. Landis will remain responsible for all carrying costs associated with such land parcel.

In addition, in connection with entering into the 2004 Agreement, Mr. Landis resigned as a director of the Company effective as of May 11, 2005
and agreed that the Company will have no future obligation to nominate Mr. Landis as a director of the Company under the Directorship Agreement or otherwise. Mr. Landis did not resign because of a disagreement with the Company on any
matter relating to its operations, policies or practices.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, a joint venture in which the Company has a 35.7% interest sold 430 Rozzi Place, an industrial property totaling 20,000 net rentable square feet, Hilltop Office Center, comprised of nine
office/technical properties totaling approximately 143,000 net rentable square feet and 560 Forbes Boulevard, an industrial property totaling 40,000 net rentable square feet located in South San Francisco, California. The properties were sold in
three separate transactions for aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately $17.8 million and the assumption by the buyer of the mortgage debt on the Hilltop Office Center properties totaling $5.2 million, resulting in aggregate gains on sale to
the Company of approximately $8.4 million (net of minority interest in the property partnership’s share of approximately $11.3 million and net of minority interest in the Operating Partnership’s share of approximately $1.7 million). The
joint venture was consolidated in the Company’s financial statements due to the Company’s unilateral control. The outside partners in the joint venture, owning a 64.3% interest, are related parties of Mr. Zuckerman. The related
parties were allocated their pro-rata share of the net proceeds from the sale totaling approximately $11.3 million.

In accordance with the Company’s 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended, and as approved by the Board of Directors, each non-employee
director has made an election to receive in lieu of cash fees deferred stock units to be settled in shares of common stock upon the cessation of such director’s service on the Board of Directors. As a result of these elections, the aggregate
cash fees otherwise payable to a non-employee director during a fiscal quarter are converted into a number of deferred stock units equal to the aggregate cash fees



divided by the last reported sales price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the last trading of the applicable fiscal quarter. The deferred
stock units are also credited with dividend equivalents. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had outstanding 46,800 and 43,552 deferred stock units, respectively, with an aggregate value of approximately $2.4 million and $2.1 million,
respectively, which amounts are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

21.    Subsequent Events

On January 17, 2006, the Company placed-in-service its Seven Cambridge Center development project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Seven Cambridge Center is a fully-leased, build-to-suit project with

October 1, 2005, the Company had placed-in-service the West Garage phase of the project consisting of parking for approximately 800 cars.

On January 31, 2006, the Company repaid the mortgage loan collateralized by its 101 Carnegie Center property located in Princeton, New Jersey
totaling approximately $6.6 million using available cash. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. The mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 7.66% per annum and was scheduled to mature on April 1, 2006.

On February 24, 2006, the Company repaid the construction
financing collateralized by its Seven Cambridge Center property located in Cambridge, Massachusetts totaling approximately $112.5 million using approximately $7.5 million of available cash and $105.0 million drawn under the Company’s Unsecured
Line of Credit. The construction financing bore interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum and was scheduled to mature in April 2007.
