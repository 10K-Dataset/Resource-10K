PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

As used herein, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to Boston Properties, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in 1997, individually or together with its
subsidiaries, including Boston Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and our predecessors. We are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or “REIT,” and one of the
largest owners and developers of office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets—Boston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. We conduct substantially all of our business
through our subsidiary, Boston Properties Limited Partnership. At December 31, 2007, we owned or had interests in 139 properties, totaling approximately 33.9 million net rentable square feet and structured parking for vehicles containing
approximately 9.9 million square feet. Our properties consisted of:

•

135 office properties comprised of 115 Class A office properties (including 13 properties under construction) and 20 Office/Technical properties;

•

one hotel; and

•

three retail properties.

We own or control undeveloped land totaling approximately 605.2 acres, which will support approximately 13.1 million square feet of development. In
addition, we have a minority interest in the Boston Properties Office Value-Added Fund, L.P., which we refer to as the “Value-Added Fund,” which is a strategic partnership with two institutional investors through which we have pursued the
acquisition of assets within our existing markets that have deficiencies in property characteristics which provide an opportunity to create value through repositioning, refurbishment or renovation. Our investments through the Value-Added Fund are
not included in our portfolio information tables or any other portfolio level statistics. At December 31, 2007, the Value-Added Fund had investments in an office complex in San Carlos, California, and an office property in Chelmsford,
Massachusetts. On January 7, 2008, we transferred our Mountain View, California properties to the Value-Added Fund. The Mountain View properties were not included in our property information set forth above as of December 31, 2007.

We consider Class A office properties to be
centrally-located buildings that are professionally managed and maintained, attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings. We consider
Office/Technical properties to be properties that support office, research and development, laboratory and other technical uses. Our definitions of Class A office and Office/Technical properties may be different than those used by other
companies.

We are a full-service real estate company, with substantial in-house expertise and resources in acquisitions, development, financing, capital markets, construction management, property management, marketing, leasing, accounting, tax and
legal services. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 660 employees. Our thirty-three senior officers have an average of twenty-four years experience in the real estate industry and an average of fifteen years of experience with us. Our
principal executive office and Boston regional office is located at The Prudential Center, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1900, Boston, Massachusetts 02199 and our telephone number is (617) 236-3300. In addition, we have regional offices at 505 9

th

Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20004; 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022; Four Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, California 94111; and
302 Carnegie Center, Princeton, New Jersey 08540.

pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The
name “Boston Properties” and our logo (consisting of a stylized “b”) are registered service marks of Boston Properties Limited Partnership.



Boston Properties Limited Partnership

Boston Properties Limited Partnership, or BPLP, is a Delaware limited
partnership, and the entity through which we conduct substantially all of our business and own, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of our assets. We are the sole general partner and, as of February 22, 2008, the owner of
approximately 84.0% of the economic interests in BPLP. Economic interest was calculated as the number of common partnership units of BPLP owned by the Company as a percentage of the sum of (1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common
partnership units of BPLP, (2) the number of common partnership units issuable upon conversion of outstanding preferred partnership units of BPLP and (3) the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding long term
incentive plan units of BPLP, or LTIP units, other than LTIP units issued in the form of 2008 Outperformance Awards assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP units. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a
share of our restricted common stock, although LTIP units issued in the form of 2008 Outperformance awards are only entitled to receive one-tenth (1/10

th

) of the regular quarterly distributions (and no special distributions) prior to being earned. See “2008 Outperformance Awards” on page 6. Our general and limited partnership interests in BPLP entitle us to share in cash
distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, BPLP in proportion to our percentage interest and entitle us to vote on all matters requiring a vote of the limited partners. The other limited partners of BPLP are persons who contributed their
direct or indirect interests in properties to BPLP in exchange for common units or preferred units of limited partnership interest in BPLP or recipients of LTIP units pursuant to the Second Amendment and Restatement of our 1997 Stock Option and
Incentive Plan (the “1997 Plan”). Under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, unitholders may present their common units of BPLP for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of the units that
may restrict such right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of a unit for redemption, BPLP must redeem the unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of our common stock. In lieu of cash redemption by
BPLP, however, we may elect to acquire any common units so tendered by issuing shares of our common stock in exchange for the common units. If we so elect, our common stock will be exchanged for common units on a one-for-one basis. This one-for-one
exchange ratio is subject to specified adjustments to prevent dilution. We generally expect that we will elect to issue our common stock in connection with each such presentation for redemption rather than having BPLP pay cash. With each such
exchange or redemption, our percentage ownership in BPLP will increase. In addition, whenever we issue shares of our common stock other than to acquire common units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership, we must contribute any net proceeds we
receive to BPLP and BPLP must issue to us an equivalent number of common units of BPLP. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or “UPREIT.”

Preferred units of BPLP have the rights, preferences and other privileges, including the right to convert into common units
of BPLP, as are set forth in an amendment to the limited partnership agreement of BPLP. As of December 31, 2007 and February 22, 2008, BPLP had one series of its preferred units outstanding. The Series Two preferred units have a
liquidation preference of $50.00 per unit (or an aggregate of approximately $55.7 million at December 31, 2007 and February 22, 2008). The Series Two preferred units are convertible, at the holder’s election, into common units at a
conversion price of $38.10 per common unit (equivalent to a ratio of 1.312336 common units per Series Two preferred unit). Distributions on the Series Two preferred units are payable quarterly and, unless the greater rate described in the next
sentence applies, accrue at 7.0% until May 12, 2009 and 6.0% thereafter. If distributions on the number of common units into which the Series Two preferred units are convertible are greater than distributions calculated using the rates
described in the preceding sentence for the applicable quarterly period, then the greater distributions are payable instead. Since May 2005, distributions have been made at the greater rate determined on the basis of distributions paid on the common
units into which the Series Two preferred units are convertible. The terms of the Series Two preferred units provide that they may be redeemed for cash in six annual tranches, beginning on May 12, 2009, at our election or at the election of the
holders. We also have the right to convert into common units of BPLP any Series Two preferred units that are not redeemed when they are eligible for redemption.



Transactions During 2007

Real Estate Acquisitions/Dispositions

In January 2007, we acquired 6601 and 6605 Springfield Center Drive, consisting of two office/technical properties aggregating approximately 97,000 net
rentable square feet located in Springfield, Virginia for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $16.5 million. On April 11, 2007, we acquired an adjacent parcel of land for a purchase price of approximately $25.6 million. The

55th Street in New York City, through a majority-owned venture, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $228.8 million. The acquisitions were financed with a $160.0 million mortgage loan, which bore interest at a variable rate equal to
LIBOR plus 0.40% per annum and was scheduled to mature in January 2009, and member capital contributions. The loan was collateralized by mortgages totaling approximately $13.6 million. On February 26, 2007, we entered into an agreement to
redeem the outside members’ equity interest in the limited liability company that owns 250 West 55th Street for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $23.4 million, of which approximately $21.0 million has been paid. On May 9,
2007, we used available cash to repay the mortgage loan.

Revenue Code.

On March 30, 2007, we acquired Kingstowne
Towne Center, a mixed-use property located in Alexandria, Virginia, at a purchase price of approximately $134.0 million. This property is comprised of two Class A office properties totaling approximately 307,000 net rentable square feet and a
retail/movie theater complex totaling approximately 88,000 net rentable square feet. The acquisition was financed with the assumption of mortgage indebtedness totaling $65.3 million and available cash. The acquisition of this property was completed

On March 30, 2007, we acquired Russia Wharf, a land parcel located in Boston, Massachusetts, for a purchase price of approximately $105.5 million.
The acquisition was financed with available cash. The land parcel will support a mixed-use development of approximately 815,000 net rentable square feet, anchored by office space. The acquisition of this property was completed as part of a
“like-kind exchange” under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.



On April 5, 2007, we sold Newport Office Park, an approximately 172,000 net rentable square foot
Class A office property located in Quincy, Massachusetts, for approximately $37.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $33.7 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $11.5 million (net of minority interest share of
approximately $2.1 million).

On April 12, 2007, we
entered into an agreement for the sale of a parcel of land located in Washington, D.C. for approximately $33.7 million. In addition, we entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the
parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. The sale is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and there can be no assurance that the sale will be consummated on the terms currently contemplated or at all.

On June 1, 2007, our Value-Added Fund sold Worldgate Plaza
located in Herndon, Virginia for approximately $109.0 million. Worldgate Plaza is an office complex consisting of approximately 322,000 net rentable square feet. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $50.5 million, of which our share was
approximately $20.3 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of $57.0 million and closing costs of approximately $1.5 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $32.8 million. Our share of the gain on sale was
approximately $15.5 million, which amount reflects the achievement of certain return thresholds as provided for in the joint venture agreement.

On July 24, 2007, we acquired 701 Carnegie Center, a land parcel located in Princeton, New Jersey, for a purchase price of approximately $3.1 million
with the title transferring pending subdivision approval. The purchase price was financed with available cash. We entered into a lease agreement on June 11, 2007 with The Trustees of Princeton University for a build-to-suit project on the site
for approximately 120,000 net rentable square feet of Class A office space. We expect that the building will be complete and available for occupancy during the fourth quarter of 2009.

On August 7, 2007, we sold Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for
approximately $280.5 million. Democracy Center is a Class A office complex that contains an aggregate of approximately 685,000 net rentable square feet. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $184.5 million, after the repayment of the mortgage
indebtedness of approximately $94.6 million and closing costs of approximately $1.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $168.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $29.9 million). The sale of this property was
completed as part of a “like-kind exchange” under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.

On November 20, 2007, we sold our Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E properties located in Loudon County, Virginia, for

office/technical property totaling approximately 127,000 net rentable square feet, respectively. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $125.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $46.5 million (net of minority interest share of
approximately $8.5 million).

On November 27, 2007, we
acquired Mountain View Research Park for $183.0 million and Mountain View Technology Park for $40.0 million. The Research Park properties are comprised of sixteen Class A office and office/technical properties aggregating approximately 601,000

acquisition was financed with available cash. On January 7, 2008, we transferred the properties to our Value-Added Fund for an aggregate of approximately $223.2 million, consisting of approximately $100.2 million of cash and a promissory note
having a principal amount of $123.0 million.

square feet and three vacant properties all located on approximately 24 acres



of land. The acquisition was financed with available cash. We expect to redevelop this site into approximately 1.3 million net rentable square feet of
Class A office space.

Developments

As of December 31, 2007, we had thirteen buildings under construction,
which aggregate an estimated total investment of $2.1 billion and 3.9 million square feet. The investment to date and estimated total investment for our properties under construction as of December 31, 2007 is detailed below (in
thousands):

(1)

Represents our share of the investment.

(2)

Includes costs associated with the land and infrastructure project in which we have a 23.89% interest.

Equity Transactions

During the year ended December 31, 2007, holders of Series Two preferred units of BPLP converted 606,186 Series Two preferred units into 795,519
common units of limited partnership interest. The common units of limited partnership interest were subsequently presented by the holders for redemption and 794,768 common units were acquired by us in exchange for an equal number of shares of common
stock and 751 common units were acquired by us in exchange for cash. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we acquired an aggregate of 547,458 common units of limited partnership interest, including 653 common units issued upon
the conversion of LTIP units, presented by the holders for redemption, in exchange for an equal number of shares of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we issued 659,798 shares of common stock as a result of stock options
being exercised.

Exchangeable Notes Offering

On February 6, 2007, our Operating Partnership
completed an offering of $862.5 million in aggregate principal amount (including $112.5 million as a result of the exercise by the initial purchasers of their over-allotment option) of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037. The notes were
priced at 97.433333% of their face amount, resulting in an effective interest rate of approximately 3.438% per annum and net proceeds to us of approximately $840.0 million. The notes mature on February 15, 2037, unless earlier repurchased,
exchanged or redeemed.

Special Dividend

On December 17, 2007, our Board of Directors (the “Board”)
declared a special cash dividend of $5.98 per common share which was paid on January 30, 2008 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2007. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the
sales of assets in 2007, including 5 Times Square, Orbital Sciences Campus, Broad Run Business Park—Building E, Worldgate Plaza and Newport Office Park. The Board did not make any change in our policy with respect to regular quarterly
dividends. The special cash dividend was in addition to the regular quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share resulting in a total payment of $6.66 per share paid on January 30, 2008.



2008 Outperformance Awards

On January 24, 2008, our Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of our Board approved outperformance awards
under the 1997 Plan to officers and key employees. These awards (the “2008 OPP Awards”) are part of a new broad-based, long-term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the
organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to our “outperforming” and creating shareholder value in a pay-for-performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders (“TRS”) over a
three-year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time-based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards
will share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three-year measurement period from February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011, based on the average
closing price of a share of our common stock for the five trading days prior to and including February 5, 2008. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a
maximum cap of $110 million, although OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million have been allocated to date and were granted on February 5, 2008. The balance remains available for future grants, with OPP awards
exceeding a potential reward of $1 million requiring the approval of the Committee (See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Business and Growth Strategies

Business Strategy

Our primary business objective is to maximize return on investment so as to provide our investors with the greatest possible total return. Our strategy to
achieve this objective is:

•

to concentrate on a few carefully selected geographic markets, including Boston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ, and to be one
of the leading, if not the leading, owners and developers in each of those markets. We select markets and submarkets where tenants have demonstrated a preference for high-quality office buildings and other facilities;

•

to emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where the lack of available sites and the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development
and the necessary financing constitute high barriers to the creation of new supply, and where skill, financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop, finance and manage high-quality office, research and development space as
well as selected retail space;

•

to take on complex, technically challenging projects, leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop, acquire or reposition properties which
other organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue;

•

to concentrate on high-quality real estate designed to meet the demands of today’s tenants who require sophisticated telecommunications and related
infrastructure and support services, and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients;

•

to opportunistically acquire assets which increase our penetration in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate and which exhibit an opportunity to improve
or preserve returns through repositioning (through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy), changes in management focus and re-leasing as existing leases terminate;

•

to explore joint venture opportunities primarily with existing owners of land parcels located in desirable locations, who seek to benefit from the depth of
development and management expertise we are able to provide and our access to capital, and/or to explore joint venture opportunities with strategic institutional partners, leveraging our skills as owners, operators and developers of Class A
office space as well as partners with expertise in mixed-use opportunities;



•

to pursue on a selective basis the sale of properties, including core properties, to take advantage of our value creation and the demand for our premier properties;

•

to seek third-party development contracts, which can be a significant source of revenue and enable us to retain and utilize our existing development and
construction management staff, especially when our internal development is less active or when new development is less-warranted due to market conditions; and

•

to enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital.

Growth Strategies

External Growth

We believe that our development experience and our organizational depth position us to continue to selectively develop a range of property types,
including low-rise suburban office properties, high-rise urban developments, mixed-use developments and research and laboratory space, within budget and on schedule. Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include:

•

our control of sites (including sites under contract or option to acquire) in our markets that will support approximately 13.1 million square feet of new
office, retail, hotel and residential development;

•

our reputation gained through 38 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties;

•

our relationships with leading national corporations and public institutions seeking new facilities and development services;

•

our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry;

•

our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provides comfort to domestic and foreign institutions, private investors and corporations who
seek to sell commercial real estate in our market areas;

•

our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing; and

•

our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality real estate assets.

Opportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three
categories:

•

Development in selected submarkets.

We believe the continued development of well-positioned office buildings will be justified in many of our submarkets. We
believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time. While we purposely concentrate in markets with high
barriers-to-entry, we have demonstrated throughout our 38-year history, an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms. We believe that
there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a well-capitalized developer to acquire land with development potential.

In the past, we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals for
development. Because of our development expertise, knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies, we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow
development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value. We seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment.



Our strong regional relationships and recognized development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on
unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development opportunities through multiple business
cycles.

•

Acquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions or individuals.

We believe that due to our size, management strength and reputation, we are
well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria. In addition, we believe that our relatively low leverage and our liquidity and access to capital may provide
us with a competitive advantage when pursuing acquisitions in the current credit-constrained environment. There may be enhanced opportunities to purchase assets with near-term financing maturities or possibly provide debt on assets at enhanced
yields given the limited availability of traditional sources of debt. We may acquire properties for cash, but we are also particularly well-positioned to appeal to sellers wishing to contribute on a tax-deferred basis their ownership of property for
equity in a diversified real estate operating company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution. Our ability to offer common and preferred units of limited partnership in BPLP to
sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets for cash or our common stock may facilitate this type of transaction on a tax-efficient basis. In addition, we may consider mergers with and acquisitions of compatible real
estate firms.

•

Acquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets

. We believe that because of our in-depth market knowledge and development experience in each
of our markets, our national reputation with brokers, financial institutions and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively-priced capital, we are well-positioned to identify and acquire existing, underperforming
properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies and a responsive property management program. We have developed this strategy and program for our existing
portfolio, where we provide high-quality property management services using our own employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand and relocate in our properties. We are able to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing
departing tenants through the use of in-house and third-party vendors’ services for marketing, including calls and presentations to prospective tenants, print advertisements, lease negotiation and construction of tenant improvements. Our
tenants benefit from cost efficiencies produced by our experienced work force, which is attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management.

Internal Growth

We believe that significant opportunities will exist to increase cash flow from our existing properties because they are of high quality and in desirable
locations. In addition, our properties are in markets where, in general, the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites, the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development on vacant land and the difficulty of
obtaining financing. Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is three-fold: (1) to provide high-quality property management services using our employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand and relocate in
our properties, (2) to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in-house services for marketing, lease negotiation and construction of tenant improvements and (3) to work with new or
existing tenants with space expansion and contraction maximizing the cash flow from our assets. We believe that our office properties will add to our internal growth because of their desirable locations and the fact that our in-place rents are
currently lower than market rents. We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to:

•

Cultivate existing submarkets and long-term relationships with credit tenants.

In choosing locations for our properties, we have paid particular attention to
transportation and commuting patterns, physical environment, adjacency to established business centers, proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors.



We had an average lease term of 7.4 years at December 31, 2007 and continue to cultivate long-term
leasing relationships with a diverse base of high quality, financially stable tenants. Based on leases in place at December 31, 2007, leases with respect to 5.5% of the total square feet in our portfolio will expire in calendar year 2008.

•

Directly manage properties to maximize the potential for tenant retention.

We provide property management services ourselves, rather than contracting for
this service, to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to tenant needs. We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our
continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in tenant relations.

•

Replace tenants quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs

. We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new tenants
and achieve relatively high rental rates as a result of our well-located, well-designed and well-maintained properties, our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to tenants, and our ability to offer expansion and
relocation alternatives within our submarkets.

•

Extend terms of existing leases to existing tenants prior to expiration

. We have also successfully structured early tenant renewals, which have reduced the
cost associated with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality credit-worthy tenants on a long-term basis and enhancing relationships.

Policies with Respect to Certain Activities

The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been
determined by our Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by our Board of Directors.

Investment Policies

Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate

Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends to our securityholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases
in the value of Boston Properties, Inc. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives.

We expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties, development projects and other
acquired properties. We currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment, and acquisitions of land that we believe have development
potential, primarily in our markets—Boston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. Future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets. We intend to engage in
such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we may purchase or lease income-producing commercial and other types of
properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such real estate properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. We do not have a policy that restricts the
amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property, however, our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants.

We may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership, including third
parties with expertise in mixed-use opportunities. These investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and, therefore, add flexibility in structuring our portfolio.



Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing
or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to our common stock. Investments are also
subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).

Investments in Real Estate Mortgages

While our current portfolio consists of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of
the Board of Directors, invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests consistent with our qualification as a REIT. Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that
the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup its full investment. Although we currently do not have any investments in mortgages or deeds of trust, we may invest in participating or convertible mortgages if we
conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in value of the property.

Securities of or Interests in Persons Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities

Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for our REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of other
REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.

Dispositions

Our disposition of properties is based upon the periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the Board of Directors that such action would be
in our best interests. Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP, including Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde, would incur
adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to us. Consequently, holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and
timing of any such sale. Such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable
gain. Generally this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction. Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code or in
a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue, recognition of the deferred tax gain allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by the sale. Some of our assets are subject to tax protection agreements, which may limit our ability to
dispose of the assets or require us to pay damages to the prior owners in the event of a taxable sale.

Financing Policies

The agreement of limited partnership of BPLP and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur. We do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may
incur. However, our mortgages, credit facilities and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. We have not established any limit on the number or amount of
mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole.

Our Board of Directors will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, including the purchase price of properties to be
acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing, the entering into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties
and BPLP as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service.



Policies with Respect to Other Activities

As the sole general partner of BPLP, we have the authority to issue additional common and preferred units of limited
partnership interest of BPLP. We have in the past, and may in the future, issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP to persons who contribute their direct or indirect interests in properties to us in exchange for such
common or preferred units of limited partnership interest in BPLP. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than BPLP and we do not intend to do so. At all times, we intend to make
investments in such a manner as to maintain our qualification as a REIT, unless because of circumstances or changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or the Treasury Regulations), our Board of Directors determines that it is no
longer in our best interest to qualify as a REIT. We may make loans to third parties, including, without limitation, to joint ventures in which we participate. We intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment
company under the 1940 Act. Our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the Board of Directors.

Energy and Natural Resource Conservation

As one of the largest owners and developers of office properties in the United States, we strive to control our energy and natural resource consumption
through active management at our properties. On an annual basis, our property managers identify capital improvement projects and building systems enhancements that have the potential to reduce the use of energy at each property. The identified
projects and enhancements are then reviewed with senior management, and the projects and enhancements that offer material energy or resource savings and meet our investment criteria are then implemented.

During 2007, we continued implementing numerous improvement projects and
system enhancements, including, without limitation, the following:

•

installation of higher efficiency lighting in public spaces, garages, stairways and elevators;

•

installation of new, high-efficiency motors, air compressors, chillers and other heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) system components;

•

replacing and upgrading energy management systems, including installation of carbon dioxide controls;

•

installation of solar reflective window film to reduce solar heat gain, glare and ultraviolet radiation, and adding wall and ceiling insulation to reduce thermal
losses;

•

modernizing cooling towers with high-efficiency fill and distribution pans;

•

implementing programs to minimize waste of water and reclaim steam condensate for our cooling towers;

•

upgrading water treatment, plumbing and irrigation operations; and

•

implementing extensive recycling programs.

In addition to the physical improvements and systems enhancements described above, our property managers also benchmark building energy consumption with
the goal of optimizing equipment use and operation, provide training for our property management staff and strive to make our tenants more aware of energy codes and energy saving opportunities. For example, we have worked collaboratively with our
tenants at many of our buildings to implement new policies for providing HVAC on weekends only upon request. We also continue to increase the use of shuttle services between certain of our properties and the local bus and subway stations to
encourage the use of mass transportation. These management initiatives are intended to not only help reduce energy consumption in the short term, but also heighten awareness of the issue to help ensure energy efficiency over the long term.



We believe our efforts described above have led to
a meaningful reduction in the number of kilowatt-hours (“kWh”) used in the operation of our properties and a reduction in our operating expenses. We estimate that the efforts we undertook in 2007 alone will reduce the amount of electrical
usage throughout our portfolio by more than 2.4 million kWh per year. Our efforts have also been recognized by third parties as we have achieved the Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star

®

designation at several of our buildings and have earned energy conservation awards and recognition at properties located throughout our portfolio.

In addition to the efforts described above, we participate in utility rebate programs when making significant capital
improvements and, when economically practicable, we subscribe to long-term, fixed utility contracts on a regional basis.

On an annual basis, we intend to continue to explore ways of reducing our energy consumption and related expenses, and conserving natural resources,
across our portfolio.

Environmentally Sound Development

“Green” buildings are designed, constructed, and operated to provide greater environmental, economic, health and productivity performance than conventional buildings. As a developer, we participate in the U.S. Green Building
Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. The LEED Green Building Rating System

®

is a voluntary, consensus-based national standard of design guidelines
for high-performance, sustainable “Green” buildings. The USGBC’s LEED certification follows a rigorous registration process which evaluates and gives Certified, Silver, Gold, and Platinum ratings to green buildings.

We currently have LEED registered projects under development throughout our
portfolio, including the following:

•

250 West 55th Street—This 1,000,000 square foot Class A office tower in New York, NY has been pre-certified with a Gold LEED rating.

•

Annapolis Junction—This 117,600 square foot Class A office property in Annapolis, MD has been pre-certified with a Gold LEED rating.

•

77 CityPoint—This 210,000 square foot Class A office property in Waltham, MA has been pre-certified with a Silver LEED rating.

We also have several other development
projects that have been designed to achieve LEED certification. These include Russia Wharf, an 815,000 square foot office tower in Boston, MA, and 701 Carnegie Center, a 120,000 square foot office property in Princeton, NJ. We expect to apply for
official LEED pre-certification of these projects in due course. In addition, we actively seek opportunities to achieve LEED ratings on commercial interiors as tenants build-out or renovate their space. We have numerous commercial interior projects
either planned or currently under construction that have been designed to achieve LEED certification, and we have already completed various projects that either already received, or we expect will receive, LEED certifications, including our new
headquarters in the Prudential Center in Boston.

Many of the
local jurisdictions in which we operate and develop buildings are also making efforts to promote environmentally sound developments by adopting aspects of the LEED program. As a result, we intend to continue to be proactive in evaluating each new
development to determine whether it is physically practical and economically feasible to produce a LEED certified building.



Competition

We compete in the leasing of office space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have
greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us. In addition, our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and to the manager
of our one hotel, Marriott International, Inc.

Principal
factors of competition in our primary business of owning, acquiring and developing office properties are the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and
convenience of location, the quality and breadth of tenant services provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in the relevant market. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends
of the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental
regulations, legislation and population trends.

Our Hotel
Property

We operate our hotel property through a taxable
REIT subsidiary. The taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to leases for the hotel property. As lessor, BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property. The hotel lease allows
all the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements. Marriott has been engaged under a separate
long-term incentive management agreement to operate and manage the hotel on behalf of the taxable REIT subsidiary. In connection with these arrangements, Marriott has agreed to operate and maintain our hotel in accordance with its system-wide
standard for comparable hotels and to provide the hotel with the benefits of its central reservation system and other chain-wide programs and services. Under a management agreement for the hotel, Marriott acts as the taxable REIT subsidiary’s
agent to supervise, direct and control the management and operation of the hotel and receives as compensation base management fees that are calculated as a percentage of the hotel’s gross revenues, and supplemental incentive fees if the hotel
exceeds negotiated profitability breakpoints. In addition, the taxable REIT subsidiary compensates Marriott, on the basis of a formula applied to the hotel’s gross revenues, for certain system-wide services provided by Marriott, including
central reservations, marketing and training. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, Marriott received an aggregate of approximately $3.2 million, $4.7 million and $4.2, respectively. For the years 2006 and 2005, these amounts include payments related to Long
Wharf Marriott and Residence Inn by Marriott hotel properties, as applicable.

Corporate Governance

Boston Properties is currently managed by a nine member
Board of Directors, which is divided into three classes (Class I, Class II and Class III). Our Board of Directors is currently composed of three Class I directors (Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Carol B. Einiger and Richard E. Salomon), four Class II
directors (Lawrence S. Bacow, Zoë Baird, Alan J. Patricof and Martin Turchin) and two Class III directors (Edward H. Linde and David A. Twardock). As a result of the resignation of William M. Daley in May 2007, there is currently a vacancy in



Class III. The members of each class of our Board of Directors serve for staggered three-year terms, and the terms of our current Class I, Class II and Class
III directors expire upon the election and qualification of directors at the annual meetings of stockholders held in 2010, 2008 and 2009, respectively. At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors will be elected or re-elected for a full term
of three years to succeed those directors whose terms are expiring.

Our Board of Directors has Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. The membership of each of these committees is described below.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. We refer to the shares of our common stock and the units of limited
partnership interest in BPLP together as our “securities,” and the investors who own shares or units, or both, as our “securityholders.” This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the
qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 40.

Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.

Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our office
and hotel properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected. The following
factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our office and hotel properties:

•

downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment);

•

competition from other office, hotel and commercial buildings;

•

local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, hotel or other commercial space;

•

changes in interest rates and availability of attractive financing;

•

vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;

•

increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;

•

civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;

•

significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not
reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property;

•

declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; and

•

decreases in the underlying value of our real estate.

We are dependent upon the economic climates of our markets—Boston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ.

Substantially all of our revenue is derived from properties located in five
markets: Boston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. A downturn in the economies of these markets, or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies, could result in reduced
demand for office space. Because our portfolio consists primarily of office buildings (as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio), a decrease in demand for office space in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.
Additionally, there are submarkets within our markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries. For example, in our Washington, D.C. market we focus on leasing office properties to governmental agencies and contractors, as well as
legal firms. In our midtown Manhattan market we have historically leased properties to financial, legal and other professional firms. A significant downturn in one or more of these sectors could adversely affect our results of operations.



Our investment in property development may be more costly than anticipated.

We intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office
properties. Our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:

•

we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;

•

we may incur construction costs for a development project which exceed our original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased materials, labor,
leasing or other costs, which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs;

•

we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which
could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;

•

we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and as a result we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred;

•

we may expend funds on and devote management’s time to projects which we do not complete; and

•

we may be unable to complete construction and/or leasing of a property on schedule.

Investment returns from our developed properties may be lower than anticipated.

Our developed properties may be exposed to the following risks:

•

we may lease developed properties at rental rates that are less than the rates projected at the time we decide to undertake the development; and

•

occupancy rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in
our investments being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all.

We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties.

We may develop properties, either alone or through joint ventures with other persons, that are known as “mixed-use” developments. This means
that in addition to the development of office space, the project may also include space for other commercial purposes. We have limited experience in developing and managing non-office and non-retail real estate. As a result, if a development project
includes a non-office or non-retail use, we may seek to sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer with experience in that use or we may seek to partner with such a developer. If we are not able to sell the rights or partner with
such a developer, or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, but also to specific risks associated with the
development and ownership of non-office and non-retail real estate. In addition, even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture, we may be exposed to the risks associated
with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected. These include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves (including providing any necessary
financing).

We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund
acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.

We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that only a small portion of



the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it
matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or
repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant “balloon” payments come due. In addition, we may rely on debt to fund a portion
of our new investments such as our acquisition and development activity. There is a risk that we may be unable to finance these activities on favorable terms or at all. This risk is currently heightened because the debt market
is experiencing volatility, including reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums. These conditions, which increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt, may continue or worsen in the future.

We have agreements with a number of limited partners of BPLP who contributed
properties in exchange for partnership interests that require BPLP to maintain for specified periods of time secured debt on certain of our assets and/or allocate partnership debt to such limited partners to enable them to continue to defer
recognition of their taxable gain with respect to the contributed property. These tax protection and debt allocation agreements may restrict our ability to repay or refinance debt.

An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to
refinance existing debt or sell assets.

As of
February 22, 2008, we had approximately $142.3 million of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, and we may incur more of such indebtedness in the future. Approximately $96.7 million of this variable rate debt is fixed through an
interest rate swap contract at 5.82% per annum through October 2008. If interest rates increase, then so will the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and
interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements and
other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. While these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements
will not perform, we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly-effective cash
flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended” (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount
third-parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those
that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facility, unsecured debt securities and secured loans contain customary
restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured
debt, which we must maintain. Our continued ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants. In addition, our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the
applicable debt agreement, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. Additionally, in
the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders’ insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism or losses resulting from earthquakes than
is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms.



We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, issuances of
unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance our acquisition and development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or to refinance existing
indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of
the property securing the defaulted loan. In addition, our unsecured debt agreements contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in
default under other loans in some circumstances. Defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock or debt
securities.

On February 22, 2008, we had
approximately $5.5 billion in total indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis (i.e., excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt). Debt to market capitalization ratio, which measures total debt as a percentage of the aggregate of total debt
plus the market value of outstanding equity securities, is often used by analysts to gauge leverage for equity REITs such as us. Our market value is calculated using the price per share of our common stock. Using the closing stock price of $88.06
per share of our common stock of Boston Properties, Inc. on February 22, 2008, multiplied by the sum of (1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP (including common partnership units held by us),
(2) the number of common partnership units available upon conversion of all outstanding preferred partnership units of BPLP and (3) the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP units (other than LTIP units
issued in the form of 2008 Outperformance Awards) assuming all conditions have been met for conversion of the LTIP units, our debt to total market capitalization ratio was approximately 31% as of February 22, 2008.

Our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional
financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. Our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by the three major rating agencies. However, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to maintain this rating, and in the event our senior debt is downgraded from its current rating, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and/or difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Our degree of leverage could also
make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. There is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio, which is in part a function of our stock price, or our ratio of indebtedness to other measures of
asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities.

We face risks associated with property acquisitions.

We have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that
could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:

•

even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non-refundable deposit and incurring
certain other acquisition-related costs;

•

we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;

•

acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;

•

the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be greater than our estimates;

•

the acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions
that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied;



•

acquired properties may be located in new markets where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of
business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and

•

we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and
this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in
exchange for partnership interests in BPLP. This acquisition structure has the effect, among others, of reducing the amount of tax depreciation we can deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and typically requires that we agree to
protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. These
restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.

Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.

We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties
with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations
and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:

•

liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;

•

claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;

•

liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and

•

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties.

We plan to continue to acquire properties as we are presented
with attractive opportunities. We may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors, and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks:

•

we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and private
REITs, institutional investment funds and other real estate investors; and

•

even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.

Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility
with jointly owned investments.

In appropriate
circumstances, we intend to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. We currently have eight joint ventures that are not consolidated with our financial
statements. Our share of the aggregate revenue of these joint ventures represented approximately 2.5% of our total revenue (the sum of our total consolidated revenue and our share of such joint venture revenue) for the year ended December 31,
2007. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:

•

we could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop or operate a property;



•

our joint venture partners may default on their obligations necessitating that we fulfill their obligation ourselves;

•

our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties; and

•

our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.

Our properties face significant competition.

We face significant competition from developers, owners and operators of
office properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from our tenants. Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. This competition may affect our ability to
attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge. These competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may result in their owners being willing to lease available space at lower rates than the
space in our properties.

We face potential difficulties or delays
renewing leases or re-leasing space.

We derive most
of our income from rent received from our tenants. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. Also, when our tenants decide not to renew their leases or
terminate early, we may not be able to re-let the space. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than
current lease terms. As a result, our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected.

We face potential adverse effects from major tenants’ bankruptcies or insolvencies.

The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. Our tenants could
file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future. We cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. On the other hand, a bankrupt tenant may reject and terminate its lease with us. In such case, our claim against the
bankrupt tenant for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and, even so, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. This
shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.

We may have difficulty selling our properties, which may limit our flexibility.

Large and high-quality office and hotel properties like the ones that we own could be difficult to sell. This may limit our ability to change our
portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our
securityholders. These restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to dispose of some of our properties is constrained by their tax
attributes. Properties which we developed and have owned for a significant period of time or which we acquired through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP often have low tax bases. If we dispose of
these properties outright in taxable transactions, we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our securityholders under the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code for REITs, which in turn would impact our cash
flow and increase our leverage. In some cases, without incurring additional costs we may be restricted from disposing of properties contributed in exchange for our partnership interests under tax



protection agreements with contributors. To dispose of low basis or tax-protected properties efficiently we from time to time use like-kind exchanges, which
qualify for non-recognition of taxable gain, but can be difficult to consummate and result in the property for which the disposed assets are exchanged inheriting their low tax bases and other tax attributes (including tax protection covenants).

Because we own a hotel property, we face the risks associated with the
hospitality industry.

Because the lease payments we
receive under our hotel lease is based on a participation in the gross receipts of the hotel, if the hotel does not generate sufficient receipts, our cash flow would be decreased, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to
our securityholders. The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel property:

•

our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, a number of which have greater marketing and financial resources than our hotel-operating business
partners;

•

if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, our hotel-operating business partners may not be able to offset such increase
by increasing room rates;

•

our hotel property is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism; and

•

our hotel property is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war and terrorism.

In addition, because our hotel property is
located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it is subject to the Cambridge market’s fluctuations in demand, increases in operating costs and increased competition from additions in supply.

We face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.

We continue to have significant cash balances that we invest in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to
preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. From time to time, these investments may include (either directly or indirectly):

•

direct obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury;

•

obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies;

•

taxable municipal securities;

•

obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and thrifts;

•

commercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term U.S. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks;

•

repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and asset-backed obligations;

•

both registered and unregistered money market funds; and

•

other highly rated short-term securities.

Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. Under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part
of our investment, and our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended. In addition, there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value. A decline in the value of our
investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.



Failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would
substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends.

If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes, we will be taxed as a corporation. We believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT and intend to operate in a manner that will allow
us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we are qualified as such, or that we will remain qualified as such in the future. This is because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and
complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. Future legislation, new
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of
such qualification.

In addition, we currently hold certain of
our properties, and the Value-Added Fund holds its properties, through a subsidiary that has elected to be taxed as a REIT and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or
more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as REITs. If any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT we will face serious tax consequences that
will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular
corporate rates;

•

we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes;

•

unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during
which we were disqualified; and

•

all dividends will be subject to tax as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will no longer be required
to pay dividends. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and it would adversely affect the value of our common stock.

In order to maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds during
unfavorable market conditions.

In order to maintain
our REIT status, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. To qualify as REIT, we generally must distribute to
our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding capital gains. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends paid by us in any calendar year are less than the
sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We may need short-term debt or long-term debt or proceeds from asset sales, creation of joint ventures or sales of common
stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of
reserves or required debt or amortization payments. The inability of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise short—and long-term debt or sell equity securities in order to fund
distributions required to maintain our REIT status.



Congress has introduced legislation that, if enacted, could cause Boston Properties Limited Partnership to be
taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the publicly traded partnership rules.

Legislation was recently introduced in Congress that would treat publicly traded partnerships as corporations for federal income tax purposes if the
partnership directly or indirectly derives income from certain investment adviser or asset management services. Because certain of our Operating Partnership’s activities could constitute investment adviser or asset management services as
defined for these purposes, unless transfers of ownership of interests in BPLP are limited in a manner that complies with certain regulatory safe harbors or another exception applies, it is possible that this legislation, if enacted, could cause
BPLP to be taxable as a corporation. Classification of BPLP as a corporation would also cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Under a transitional rule contained in one version of the proposed legislation BPLP would be exempt from the new rules
until its taxable year beginning January 1, 2013. An alternative proposal, however, would shorten the transition period to make the new law applicable to existing publicly-traded partnerships beginning January 1, 2008, and it is possible
that any legislation ultimately enacted could be effective immediately, or possibly even retroactively.

Congress is also considering legislative proposals to treat all or part of certain income allocated to a partner by a partnership in respect of certain
services provided to or for the benefit of the partnership (“carried interest revenue”) as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. While the current legislative proposal provides that such income will nevertheless retain its
original character for purposes of the REIT qualification tests, it is not clear what form any such final legislation would take. Furthermore, under the proposed legislation, carried interest revenue could be treated as non- qualifying income for
purposes of the “qualifying income” exception to the publicly-traded partnership rules. If enacted, this could result in BPLP being taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the amount of any such carried interest
revenue plus any other non-qualifying income earned by BPLP exceeds 10% of its gross income in any taxable year.

Limits on changes in control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership
agreement of BPLP, as well as provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Delaware corporate law, may:

•

delay or prevent a change of control over us or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to our stockholders; and

•

limit our stockholders’ opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then-prevailing market prices.

Stock Ownership Limit

To facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a REIT and to otherwise
address concerns relating to concentration of capital stock ownership, our certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 6.6% of the number of outstanding
shares of any class or series of our common stock. We refer to this limitation as the “ownership limit.” Our board of directors may waive, in its sole discretion, or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is
satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, under our certificate of incorporation each of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde, along with their
respective families and affiliates, as well as, in general, pension plans and mutual funds, may actually and beneficially own up to 15% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our equity common stock. Shares owned in violation
of the ownership limit will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties. The ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.



BPLP’s Partnership Agreement

We have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP not to engage in specified extraordinary transactions,
including, among others, business combinations, unless limited partners of BPLP other than Boston Properties, Inc. receive, or have the opportunity to receive, either (1) the same consideration for their partnership interests as holders of our
common stock in the transaction or (2) limited partnership units that, among other things, would entitle the holders, upon redemption of these units, to receive shares of common equity of a publicly traded company or the same consideration as
holders of our common stock received in the transaction. If these limited partners would not receive such consideration, we cannot engage in the transaction unless limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership
interest, other than those held by Boston Properties, Inc. or its affiliates, consent to the transaction. In addition, we have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP that we will not complete specified extraordinary transactions,
including among others, business combinations, in which we receive the approval of our common stockholders unless (1) limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by Boston
Properties, Inc. or its affiliates, consent to the transaction or (2) the limited partners of BPLP are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as common stockholders on the
transaction. Therefore, if our common stockholders approve a specified extraordinary transaction, the partnership agreement requires the following before we can complete the transaction:

•

holders of partnership interests in BPLP, including Boston Properties, Inc., must vote on the matter;

•

Boston Properties, Inc. must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as our stockholders voted on the transaction; and

•

the result of the vote of holders of partnership interests in BPLP must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders, the business combination would have
been approved.

As a result of these
provisions, a potential acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal, and we may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed extraordinary transaction, including a proposed business combination, even though our stockholders
approve of the transaction.

Shareholder Rights Plan

We have a shareholder rights plan. Under the terms of this
plan, we can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock because, unless we approve of the acquisition, after the person acquires more than 15% of our outstanding common stock, all
other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value. This would substantially reduce the value and influence of the stock owned by the acquiring person. Our board of
directors can prevent the plan from operating by approving the transaction in advance, which gives us significant power to approve or disapprove of the efforts of a person or group to acquire a large interest in our company.

Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our common
stock.

As with other publicly traded equity
securities, the value of our common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the value of our common stock are the following:

•

the extent of investor interest in our securities;

•

the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real
estate-based companies;

•

our underlying asset value;

•

investor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally;



•

national economic conditions;

•

changes in tax laws;

•

our financial performance;

•

changes in our credit ratings; and

•

general stock and bond market conditions.

The market value of our common stock is based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future
earnings and cash dividends. Consequently, our common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than our net asset value per share of common stock. If our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected, it is likely that the
market price of our common stock will diminish.

Further issuances of
equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders.

The interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments, acquisitions, or repay indebtedness. Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our
access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity.

The number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price
of our stock.

In connection with and subsequent to
our initial public offering, we have completed many private placement transactions in which shares of capital stock of Boston Properties, Inc. or partnership interests in BPLP were issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional
investors. This common stock, or common stock issuable in exchange for such partnership interests in BPLP, may be sold in the public securities markets over time under registration rights we granted to these investors. Additional common stock
issuable under our employee benefit and other incentive plans, including as a result of the grant of stock options and restricted equity securities, may also be sold in the market at some time in the future. Future sales of our common stock in the
market could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of our common stock.

We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.

Our operating and financial policies, including our policies
with respect to acquisitions of real estate, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our securityholders do not control these policies.

Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.

We depend on the efforts of key personnel,
particularly Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Chairman of our Board of Directors, Edward H. Linde, our Chief Executive Officer, and Douglas T. Linde, our President. Among the reasons that Messrs. Zuckerman, E. Linde and D. Linde are important to our success
is that each has a national reputation, which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders. If we lost their services, our relationships with lenders, potential tenants and industry personnel could
diminish. Mr. Zuckerman has substantial outside business interests that could interfere with his ability to devote his full time to our business and affairs.

Our two Executive Vice Presidents and five Regional Managers also have strong reputations. Their reputations aid us in
identifying opportunities, having opportunities brought to us, and negotiating with tenants and build-to-suit prospects. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could materially and
adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, prospective tenants and industry personnel.



Conflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in BPLP.

Sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have
different effects on holders of interests in BPLP than on our stockholders.

Some holders of interests in BPLP, including Messrs. Zuckerman and E. Linde, would incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the
tax consequences to us and our stockholders. Consequently, these holders of partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt. While we have exclusive
authority under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, subject, in the case of certain properties, to the contractual commitments described
below, any such decision would require the approval of our Board of Directors. While the Board of Directors has a policy with respect to these matters, as directors and executive officers, Messrs. Zuckerman and E. Linde could exercise their
influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of our stockholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.

Agreement not to sell some properties.

We have entered into agreements with respect to some properties that we have
acquired in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP. Pursuant to those agreements, we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer some of our properties, prior to specified dates, in any transaction that would trigger taxable income and we are
responsible for the reimbursement of certain tax-related costs to the prior owners if the subject properties are sold in a taxable sale. In general, our obligations to the prior owners are limited in time and only apply to actual damages suffered.
As of December 31, 2007, there were a total of 24 wholly-owned properties subject to these restrictions, and those properties are estimated to have accounted for approximately 34% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007.

BPLP has also entered into agreements providing prior owners
of properties with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and, in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced, additional and/or substitute indebtedness. These agreements may hinder actions that we
may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because we would be required to make payments to the beneficiaries of such agreements if we violate these agreements.

Messrs. Zuckerman and E. Linde will continue to engage in other
activities.

Messrs. Zuckerman and E. Linde have a broad
and varied range of investment interests. Either one could acquire an interest in a company which is not currently involved in real estate investment activities but which may acquire real property in the future. However, pursuant to each of their
employment agreements, Messrs. Zuckerman and E. Linde will not, in general, have management control over such companies and, therefore, they may not be able to prevent one or more of such companies from engaging in activities that are in competition
with our activities.

Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans
with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including office buildings and hotels, be made accessible to disabled
persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital
expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders.



Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and
local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will
require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.

Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.

We carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained
by owners of similar properties. In response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (as amended, “TRIA”) was enacted in November 2002
to require regulated insurers to make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the statute). The expiration date of TRIA was extended to December 31, 2014 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of
2007 (“TRIPRA”). Prior to TRIPRA, only acts of foreign terrorism could be “certified” for coverage under TRIA. Under TRIPRA, acts of both foreign and domestic terrorism can be “certified” for coverage under TRIA.
Currently, the Company’s property insurance program per occurrence limits are $900 million, including coverage for foreign acts of terrorism “certified” under TRIA and coverage for domestic acts of terrorism up to $500 million per
occurrence, and an additional $400 million of coverage for domestic acts of terrorism on a per occurrence and annual aggregate basis. Currently, we also carry nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage (“NBCR
Coverage”) for foreign acts of terrorism “certified” under TRIA, which is provided by IXP, LLC as a direct insurer, excluding our Value-Added Fund properties. The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is $900 million. Under TRIA,
after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the NBCR Coverage is backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a “program trigger.” The
program trigger is $100 million and the coinsurance is 10%. Under TRIPRA, if the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA
coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIPRA. We may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if there is a change in our portfolio or for any other reason.
We intend to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable.

We also currently carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes in an
amount and subject to self-insurance that we believe are commercially reasonable. In addition, this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. Specifically, we currently carry earthquake insurance
which covers our San Francisco region with a $120 million per occurrence limit and a $120 million annual aggregate limit, $20 million of which is provided by IXP, LLC, as a direct insurer. The amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be
sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact our ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. We may discontinue earthquake insurance on some or all of our properties in the
future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage.

In January 2002, we formed a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, IXP, Inc., to act as a captive insurance company and be one of the elements of our overall insurance program. On September 27, 2006, IXP, Inc.
was merged into IXP, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, and all insurance policies issued by IXP, Inc. were cancelled and reissued by IXP, LLC. The term “IXP” refers to IXP, Inc. for the period prior to September 27, 2006 and to IXP, LLC
for the period on and subsequent to September 27, 2006. IXP acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage for our Greater San Francisco properties and our NBCR Coverage for foreign acts of terrorism
“certified” under TRIA. Insofar as we own IXP, we are responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP are part of our consolidated financial statements. In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by our
NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the



Federal Government. IXP would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out under TRIA and if IXP
maintains the NBCR policy after the payout by the Federal Government. If we experience a loss and IXP is required to pay under its insurance policy, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of IXP’s required payment. Therefore,
insurance coverage provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism in particular, but we
cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars or the presence of mold at our properties, for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or
at a reasonable cost. With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged
properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the
property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations.

Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties.

We have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been
or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks, including midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C., Boston and San Francisco. As a result, some tenants in these markets may choose to relocate their businesses to other
markets or to lower-profile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity. This could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these markets generally or in
our properties in particular, which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both. In addition, future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage
our properties, both physically and financially, or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially. See also
“

—Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.

”

We face risks associated with our tenants being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.

Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”)
maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”). OFAC regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with Prohibited Persons (the
“OFAC Requirements”). Certain of our loan and other agreements require us to comply with OFAC Requirements. We have established a compliance program whereby tenants and others with whom we conduct business are checked against the OFAC list
of Prohibited Persons prior to entering into any agreement and on a periodic basis thereafter. Our leases and other agreements require the other party to comply with OFAC Requirements. If a tenant or other party with whom we contract is placed on
the OFAC list we may be required by the OFAC Requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement. Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful.

Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs.

Under federal, state and local environmental laws,
ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real
estate. If unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders, because:

•

as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination;



•

the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination;

•

even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible
for all of the clean-up costs; and

•

governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs.

These costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the amount
of our insurance or the value of the contaminated property. We currently carry environmental insurance in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. Specifically, we carry a pollution legal liability policy
with a $10 million limit per incident and a policy aggregate limit of $25 million. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may materially and adversely affect our ability
to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. In addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination. Changes in laws
increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties, or increasing the restrictions on the handling, storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in
significant unanticipated expenditures.

Environmental laws
also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos:

•

properly manage and maintain the asbestos;

•

notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and

•

undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building.

Such laws may impose fines and penalties on
building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.

Some of our properties are located in urban and previously developed areas
where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination. It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to
our acquisition of properties. These assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant
state, federal and historical documents, but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling. Where appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing,
including sampling for asbestos, for lead in drinking water, for soil contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage creates a potential environmental problem, and for contamination in groundwater.
Even though these environmental assessments are conducted, there is still the risk that:

•

the environmental assessments and updates did not identify all potential environmental liabilities;

•

a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments;

•

new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and

•

future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us.



Inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and, depending on the results,
remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs. Indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants such as molds,
pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants above certain levels can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. If these conditions were
to occur at one of our properties, we may need to undertake a targeted remediation program, including without limitation, steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants. Such remediation programs could be costly,
necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the property’s tenants or require rehabilitation of the affected property.

We did not obtain new owner’s title insurance policies in connection with properties acquired during our initial public offering.

We acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion
of our initial public offering in June 1997. Before we acquired these properties, each of them was insured by a title insurance policy. We did not obtain new owner’s title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of these
properties. However, to the extent we have financed properties after acquiring them in connection with the IPO, we have obtained new title insurance policies, however, the amount of these policies may be less than the current or future value of the
applicable properties. Nevertheless, because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by acquiring ownership of the entity that owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries, some of these title
insurance policies may continue to benefit us. Many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties. If there was a title defect related to any of these properties, or to any
of the properties acquired at the time of our initial public offering, that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose both our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property. We have obtained title insurance
policies for all properties that we have acquired after our initial public offering, however, these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties.

Because of the ownership structure of our hotel property, we face potential adverse
effects from changes to the applicable tax laws.

We
own one hotel property. However, under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs like us are not allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we lease our hotel property to one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. As lessor, we are entitled to
a percentage of the gross receipts from the operation of the hotel property. Marriott International, Inc. manages the hotel under the Marriott name pursuant to a management contract with the taxable REIT subsidiary as lessee. While the taxable REIT
subsidiary structure allows the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us, the taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotel at the federal and state level. In addition, the taxable REIT subsidiary is
subject to detailed tax regulations that affect how it may be capitalized and operated. If the tax laws applicable to taxable REIT subsidiaries are modified, we may be forced to modify the structure for owning our hotel property, and such changes
may adversely affect the cash flows from our hotel. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, and we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent
new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such actions may prospectively or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the taxable REIT subsidiary and, therefore, may adversely affect our after-tax returns
from our hotel property.

We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.

From time to time changes in state and local tax laws
or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur,
we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.



We face possible state and local tax audits.

Because we are organized and qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but are subject to
certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our
positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits
have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Properties

At December 31, 2007, our portfolio consisted of 139 properties totaling 43.8 million net rentable square feet. Our properties consisted of
(1) 135 office properties, comprised of 102 Class A office buildings, including 13 properties under construction, and 20 properties that support both office and technical uses, (2) three retail properties and (3) one hotel. In
addition, we own or control 605.2 acres of land for future development. The table set forth below shows information relating to the properties we owned, or in which we had an ownership interest, at December 31, 2007. On January 7, 2008, we
transferred the Mountain View properties to the Value-Added Fund. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the financial results of these properties are included in our consolidated financial results, but not included in any of our portfolio
information tables or any other portfolio level statistics. Information relating to properties owned by the Value-Added Fund is not included in our portfolio information tables or any other portfolio level statistics because the Value-Added Fund
invests in assets within our existing markets that have deficiencies in property characteristics which provide an opportunity to create value through repositioning, refurbishment or renovation. We therefore believe including such information in our
portfolio tables and statistics would render the portfolio information less useful to investors. Information relating to the Value-Added Fund is set forth below separately.

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

(a) Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol “BXP.” The high and low sales prices and distributions for the periods indicated in the table below were:

(1)

Paid on January 30, 2008 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2007. Amount includes a $5.98 per common share special dividend.

(2)

Paid on January 30, 2007 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 29, 2006. Amount includes a $5.40 per common share special dividend.

At February 22, 2008, we had approximately
1,536 stockholders of record. This does not include beneficial owners for whom Cede & Co. or others act as nominee.

In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income (not
including net capital gains). We have adopted a policy of paying regular quarterly distributions on our common stock, and we have adopted a policy of paying regular quarterly distributions on the common units of BPLP. Cash distributions have been
paid on our common stock and BPLP’s common units since our initial public offering. Distributions are declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on actual and anticipated cash from operations, our financial condition,
capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and other factors the Board of Directors may consider relevant.

During the three months ended December 31, 2007, we issued an aggregate of 14,633 common shares in exchange
for 14,633 common units of limited partnership held by certain limited partners of BPLP. These shares were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(2). We relied on the exemption under Section 4(2) based upon
factual representations received from the limited partners who received the common shares.



Stock Performance Graph

The following graph provides a comparison of cumulative total stockholder return for the period from December 31, 2002 through December 31,
2007, among Boston Properties, the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (“NAREIT”) Equity REIT Total Return Index (the “Equity REIT
Index”) and the NAREIT Office REIT Index (the “Office REIT Index”). The Equity REIT Index includes all tax-qualified equity REITs listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ Stock Market. Equity
REITs are defined as those with 75% or more of their gross invested book value of assets invested directly or indirectly in the equity ownership of real estate. The Office REIT Index includes all office REITs included in the Equity REIT Index. Data
for Boston Properties, the S&P 500 Index, the Equity REIT Index and the Office REIT Index was provided to us by NAREIT. Upon written request, Boston Properties will provide any stockholder with a list of the REITs included in the Equity REIT
Index and the Office REIT Index. The stock performance graph assumes an investment of $100 in each of Boston Properties and the three indices, and the reinvestment of any dividends. The historical information set forth below is not necessarily
indicative of future performance. The data shown is based on the share prices or index values, as applicable, at the end of each month shown.

Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth our selected financial and operating data on a historical basis, which has been revised for the reclassification of
(1) losses from early extinguishments of debt in accordance with SFAS No. 145, (2) the restatement of earnings per share to include the effects of participating securities in accordance with EITF 03-6 and (3) the disposition of
qualifying properties during 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 which have been reclassified as discontinued operations, for the periods presented, in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Refer to Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
following data should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Our historical operating results may not be comparable to our future
operating results.



(1)

Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, we calculate Funds from Operations, or “FFO,” by adjusting net
income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures
and preferred distributions. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the
investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses
related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and
useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real
estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amount represents our share, which was 85.32%, 84.40%, 83.74%, 82.97% and 82.06% for the years
ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively, after allocation to the minority interest in the Operating Partnership.

In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO, as adjusted, for the years
ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2003 which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and adjustments for net derivative losses related to non-qualifying derivative
contracts.

The adjustment to exclude losses from early
extinguishments of debt results when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debt’s stated maturity and to write-off unamortized loan costs at the date of the extinguishment. Such
costs are excluded from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP. However, we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost of the sale transactions
because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions. We believe that this supplemental adjustment more appropriately reflects the
results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions.

The adjustments for net derivative losses related to non-qualifying derivative contracts for the year ended December 31, 2003 resulted from interest rate contracts we entered into prior to the effective date of
SFAS No. 133 to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to variable rate debt associated with real estate projects under development. Upon transition to SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, the impacts of these
contracts were recorded in current earnings, while prior to that time they were capitalized. Although these adjustments were attributable to a single hedging program, the underlying contracts extended over multiple reporting periods and therefore
resulted in adjustments through the third quarter of 2003. Management presents FFO before the impact of non-qualifying derivative contracts



because economically this interest rate hedging program was consistent with our risk management objective of limiting our exposure to interest rate
volatility and the change in accounting under GAAP did not correspond to a substantive difference. Management does not currently anticipate structuring future hedging programs in a manner that would give rise to this kind of adjustment.

Although our FFO, as adjusted, clearly differs from NAREIT’s
definition of FFO, and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that, by excluding the effects of the losses from
early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the
objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO.

Neither FFO, nor FFO as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, represent cash generated from operating
activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO, as adjusted should be compared with our
reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

A reconciliation of FFO, and FFO, as adjusted, to net income available to common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP is provided under the
heading of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Funds from Operations.”

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report
on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions “Business-Business and Growth Strategies,” “Risk Factors” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are
based on management’s beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“may,” “might,” “plan,” “project,” “result” “should,” “will,” and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should
one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward-looking statements. We caution you that,
while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any
responsibility to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and
trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.

Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the
following:

•

general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants’ financial
condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate);

•

failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub-markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully;



•

risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain
necessary permits and public opposition to such activities);

•

risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including the risk associated with interest
rates impacting the cost and/or availability of financing;

•

risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements;

•

risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets;

•

risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks;

•

costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws;

•

potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;

•

risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;

•

possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws;

•

the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period-to-period comparisons of financial results;

•

risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and

•

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.

The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report,
including “Part I, Item 1A- Risk Factors,” include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors
emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should
also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on Form 8-K or otherwise.

Overview

We are a fully integrated self-administered and self-managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of
Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets—Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our
Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, the costs of tenant improvements, current and anticipated operating
costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space generally and general economic factors. We also generate cash through the sale of assets, which may be either non-core assets or
core assets that command premiums from real estate investors.

The impact of the current state of the economy, including rising unemployment and constrained capital, on our company is unknown. Our core strategy has always been to operate in supply constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to
focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong tenants. Historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure to down cycles and, based on our current occupancy and recent



leasing success, lack of available supply in our markets and limited lease rollover, we believe we are well positioned to withstand a slowing economy. The
state of the debt capital markets is continuing to deteriorate with many lenders, including CMBS providers, out of the market and others such as banks and life insurance companies tightening their credit standards and cautiously allocating capital.
We believe our current liquidity, including our cash balances and the availability under our $605 million line of credit, is sufficient to meet our foreseeable capital needs and helps to insulate us from the difficulties in the capital markets. In
fact, we believe that, given our strong balance sheet and liquidity, we will have opportunities to capitalize on the current environment and we intend to seek acquisitions of high-quality real estate at attractive returns.

Although we intend to pursue such acquisitions, we continue to believe that
the returns we can generate from developments will be greater than those we can expect from acquisitions. Since the beginning of 2005 we have completed over $4.3 billion of asset sales and have redeployed a significant amount of the proceeds into
our development pipeline. We started approximately $1.7 billion of developments in 2007, including commencing construction on our approximately 1.0 million square foot office tower in New York City at 250 West 55th Street and on our 815,000
square foot mixed-use Russia Wharf development in Boston. We entered 2008 with an active development program of approximately $2.1 billion, and although we will consider additional asset sales, we do not expect our sales volume to be comparable to
that of prior years and we currently do not have any assets on the market. We believe our focus on new development will enhance our long-term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in-service in 2009, 2010 and 2011.

Update on Recent Regulatory Initiatives

On August 31, 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
“FASB”) issued proposed FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-a “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)” (the “proposed FSP”) that would
require the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible
debt borrowing rate. The proposed FSP, if issued as currently contemplated, would require that the initial debt proceeds from the sale of Boston Properties Limited Partnership’s (“BPLP”) $862.5 million of 2.875% exchangeable senior
notes due 2037 and $450.0 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 be allocated between a liability component and an equity component in a manner that reflects interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt. The
resulting debt discount would be amortized over the period during which the debt is expected to be outstanding (i.e., through the first optional redemption dates) as additional non-cash interest expense. The proposed FSP would be effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and it would be applied retrospectively to BPLP’s outstanding exchangeable senior notes for all periods presented. Based on our current
understanding of the application of the proposed FSP, this would result in an aggregate of approximately $18 million (net of incremental capitalized interest) of additional non-cash interest expense for fiscal 2008. Excluding the impact of
capitalized interest, the additional non-cash interest expense would be approximately $20 million to $22 million, and this amount (before netting) will increase in subsequent reporting periods through the first optional redemption dates as the debt
accretes to its par value over the same period. There can be no assurance that the proposed FSP will be issued in the form currently contemplated by the FASB, or at all, and therefore its ultimate impact on our interest expense may differ materially
from the aforementioned estimate.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is



possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we
evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies
that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Real Estate

Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements,
“above-” and “below-market” leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 141, “Business Combinations” and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated
cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results,
known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other
acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants’ credit quality and
expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.

We record acquired “above-” and “below-market” leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated
with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured
over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place
lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market
conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on
local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.

Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other
acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development.

Management reviews its long-lived assets used in operations
for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is
present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy,
rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be “long-lived assets to be held and used” as defined by SFAS No. 144
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” (“SFAS No. 144”) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over
the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we
determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date.



SFAS No. 144 requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have
been sold, or otherwise qualify as “held for sale,” be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following
the sale. The components of the property’s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the
property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be “held for sale” when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating
to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as “held for sale,” no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.

A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing
of properties. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease
involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 “Capitalization of Interest Cost” and SFAS No. 67 “Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real
Estate Projects.” The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction
costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of
tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only
those costs associated with the portion under construction.

Investments
in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Except for ownership
interests in variable interest entities, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. These investments are recorded
initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and
the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated
Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and
losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture’s distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interests in variable
interest entities, we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary. Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our
investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment
charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary.

Revenue Recognition

Base rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place “above-” and “below-market” leases
at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the
individual lease agreements.



Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines.
Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenant’s creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we:

•

review relevant financial information, including:

•

financial ratios;

•

net worth;

•

debt to market capitalization; and

•

liquidity;

•

evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant’s management team; and

•

assess the strength/growth of the tenant’s industry.

As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories:

(1)

low risk tenants;

(2)

the tenant’s credit is such that we require collateral, in which case we:

•

require a security deposit; and/or

•

reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or

(3)

the tenant’s credit is below our acceptable parameters.

We maintain a rigorous process of monitoring the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated
losses that could result from the tenant’s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease.

Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1-4 with a rating of 1
representing the highest possible rating with no allowance recorded and a rating of 4 representing the lowest credit rating, recording a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating
include:

•

payment history;

•

credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric);

•

change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize);

•

tenant financial performance;

•

economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and

•

industry specific credit considerations.

If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining
term of our in-place tenant leases was approximately 7.4 years as of December 31, 2007. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants’ risk profiles prior to lease
execution and frequent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.

Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant
reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue



99-19 “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent,” or Issue 99-19. Issue 99-19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded
on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. We also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll
related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with Issue 99-19.

Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long-distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie
and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned.

We receive management and development fees from third parties. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the
properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and record development fees on a straight-line basis or percentage of completion
depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners’ ownership interest.

Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of
SFAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.” The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of
management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods,
as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.

Depreciation and
Amortization

We compute depreciation and amortization
on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired “above-” and
“below-market” leases, origination costs and acquired in-place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired “above-” and
“below-market” leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage
notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market
rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the
fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate.

Results of Operations

The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 139, 131 and 121 properties, respectively (the “Total Property
Portfolio”). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period
financial data with respect to the Total



Property Portfolio are necessarily meaningful. Therefore, the comparisons of operating results for the years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005 show separately the
changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the “Same Property Portfolio”) and the changes attributable to the properties included in Properties Acquired, Sold, Repositioned and Placed-in
Service.

In our analysis of operating results, particularly to
make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service
prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service, acquired or
repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.

Net operating income, or “NOI,” is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure, plus cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest), minority interest in Operating Partnership, losses from early extinguishments of debt, depreciation and amortization, interest
expense, general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and other assets
(net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe
NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure
for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.

Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods,
NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes
certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property’s results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and
is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI
presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as
presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31,

The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 102 properties, including properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to
January 1, 2006 and owned through December 31, 2007, totaling approximately 25.5 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other
properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2006 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2007. Properties Placed In-Service includes our 505 9

th

Street joint venture project. In connection with partially placing this property in-service, we consolidated the joint venture entity that owns the property as of October 1,
2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. The Same Property Portfolio includes our Cambride Center Marriott hotel property, but does not include the Long Wharf Marriott hotel property, which was sold on
March 23, 2007. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 with respect to the properties which were
acquired, placed in-service, repositioned or sold.



(1)

For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 47. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2006 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $37,811 and $33,014, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $27,765 and $24,966, respectively, per the Consolidated Income Statement.



Rental Revenue

The increase of approximately $7.3 million in the Total Property Portfolio Rental Revenue is comprised of increases and decreases within the five
categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $54.5 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $102.9 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $40.7
million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $8.2 million and Properties Repositioned increased approximately $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006.

We incur certain tenant specific property costs for which we are reimbursed
from our tenants. Starting in 2007, we have included these reimbursements in rental revenue and included the tenant specific operating cost within real estate operating expenses. This income and expense classification in 2007 results in a presented
increase to comparable rental revenue and real estate operating expenses, however does not impact our consolidated net operating income. For the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the rental income and real estate operating expense gross up
was approximately $8.9 million and $12.0 million, respectively.

Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in base rental
revenue of approximately $39.1 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $7.3 million in straight-line rents. Approximately $18.8 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants which
correlates with the increase in operating expenses. Approximately $3.9 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income.

The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to partially placing in-service our 505 9th Street
development project in the fourth quarter of 2007, placing in-service our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. Rental revenue from Properties Placed
In-Service increased approximately $8.2 million, as detailed below:

The acquisition of
6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive, 103 Fourth Avenue, Kingstowne Towne Center, the Mountain View Properties and North First Business Park in 2007, and 303 Almaden Boulevard, 3200 Zanker Road and Four and Five Cambridge Center in 2006,
increased revenue from Properties Acquired by approximately $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as detailed below:



Rental revenue from Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased
approximately $6.8 million over the year ended December 31, 2006. Our Capital Gallery expansion project is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. In April 2006, tenants began to
take occupancy and we placed our Capital Gallery expansion project in-service in July 2006.

The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in 2006. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to
our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property through agreements entered into at the time of sale. Rental Revenue from Properties Sold decreased by approximately $102.9 million, as detailed below:

Termination Income

Termination income for the year ended
December 31, 2007 was related to multiple tenants across the Total Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, and we recognized termination income totaling approximately $7.0 million. This compared to termination income of $8.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006. We expect to recognize approximately $6 million of termination income for the year 2008.

Real Estate Operating Expenses

The $18.1 million increase in property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other
property-related expenses) in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within five categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $29.2
million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $29.1 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $12.7 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $3.3 million and Properties Repositioned increased approximately $2.0
million.

Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio
increased approximately $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in utility expenses of approximately $2.5 million, which represents an increase
of approximately 3% over the prior year to date. In addition, real estate taxes increased approximately $10.7 million due to increased real estate tax assessments and repairs and maintenance increased approximately $8.4 million. The remaining $7.6
million increase in the Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is related to an increase in cleaning contracts and other general and administrative items.



The acquisition of 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive, 103 Fourth Avenue, Kingstowne Towne
Center, the Mountain View Properties and North First Business Park in 2007, and 303 Almaden Boulevard, 3200 Zanker Road and Four and Five Cambridge Center in 2006, increased operating expenses from Properties Acquired by approximately $12.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2007 as detailed below:

The increase in
operating expenses from Properties Placed In-Service relates to partially placing in-service our 505 9th Street development project in the fourth quarter of 2007, placing in-service our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter
of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. Operating expenses from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $3.3 million, as detailed below:

Operating expenses
from Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased approximately $2.0 million over the year ended December 31, 2006. Our Capital Gallery expansion project is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended
December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. In April 2006, tenants began to take occupancy and during July 2006, we placed our Capital Gallery expansion project in-service.

A decrease of approximately $29.1 million in the Total Property Portfolio operating expenses was due to the sales of
Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in 2006, as detailed below:

We continue to
review and monitor the impact of rising energy costs, as well as other factors, on our operating budgets for fiscal year 2008. Because some operating expenses are not recoverable from tenants, an increase in operating expenses
due to one or more of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.



Hotel Net Operating Income

Net operating income for our hotel property increased approximately $2.0 million, a 24.8% increase for the year ended December 31,
2007 as compared to 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the operations of the Long Wharf Marriott was included as part of discontinued operations due to its sale on March 23, 2007.

Development and Management
Services

Development and Management Services income
increased approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. We have maintained management contracts following the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 as well as the sale of 280 Park Avenue on
June 6, 2006 which contributed to an increase of approximately $1.1 million in management fees. A decrease of approximately $0.4 million was attributed to reduced work order income. We expect third-party fee income for the year 2008 to be
between $19 million and $20 million, a slight increase due to leasing and management fees we are projecting to earn at 280 Park Avenue as well as fees generated from the additional investment in the Value-Added Fund.

Interest and Other Income

Interest and other income increased by approximately $53.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of higher overall interest rates and increased cash balances. In February 2007, our Operating Partnership issued $862.5 million of 2.875% unsecured exchangeable senior notes. On
February 15, 2007, we completed the sale of our long-term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City for approximately $1.23 billion in cash. On March 23, 2007, we completed the sale of the Long Wharf Marriott for approximately
$225.6 million in cash. On April 5, 2007, we completed the sale of Newport Office Park for approximately $33.7 million in cash. On August 7, 2007, we completed the sale of Democracy Center for approximately $184.5 million in cash and on
November 20, 2007, we completed the sale of Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park Building E properties for an aggregate of approximately $125.4 million in cash.

We paid our special dividend and regular dividend payments totaling $6.66 per share on January 30, 2008. Our current
cash balance, after the dividends and our purchase of the Mountain View Properties and North First Business Park, is approximately $750 million. As the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, short-term investment returns have decreased
significantly and therefore we anticipate interest income to be between approximately $22 million to $25 million for the year 2008.

Other Expenses

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses increased approximately $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. An overall increase of approximately $2.6 million was attributed to bonuses and salaries for the year
ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as well as an increase in long-term compensation expense of approximately $3.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized



additional expenses related to abandoned project costs of approximately $4.5 million. We anticipate our general and administrative expenses to be between $74
million and $75 million for the year 2008. A significant portion of the expected increase results from the inclusion of the 2008 OPP Awards described below, which adds approximately $4.9 million in 2008.

On January 24, 2008, our compensation committee approved outperformance
awards under the 1997 Plan to our officers and employees. These awards (the “2008 OPP Awards”) are part of a new broad-based long-term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the
organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to “outperforming” and creating shareholder value in a pay-for-performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders (“TRS”) over a three-year
measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time-based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards will share in
an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three-year measurement period from February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011, based on the average closing price of
a share of our common stock of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February 5, 2008. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap
of $110 million, although OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million have been allocated to date and were granted on February 5, 2008. The balance remains available for future grants. We expect that under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payment” the 2008 OPP Awards will have an aggregate value of approximately $19.7 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the five-year plan period
(although awards for retirement-eligible employees will be amortized over a three-year period). Because the 2008 OPP Awards requires a sustained price target to achieve the threshold stock price, unless the target has actually been met by the end of
the applicable reporting period, we will exclude all contingently issueable shares from the diluted EPS calculation. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997
Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a four- or five-year term (for awards granted
between 2003 and November 2006, vesting is over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted after November 2006, vesting will occur in equal annual installments over a four-year term). Restricted stock
and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit
awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as
an offset to "stock-based compensation." Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $27.6 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2008 and approximately $18.5 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in
January 2007 will be incurred ratably over the four-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably over the five-year
vesting period.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately
$12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease is due to (1) the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sale of Democracy Center in August 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in June 2006,
which decreased interest expense by $11.2 million, (2) the repayment of our mortgage loans collateralized by Capital Gallery, 191 Spring Street, 101 Carnegie Center, Seven Cambridge Center, Embarcadero Center Three and Embarcadero Center Four,
504, 506, 508 and 510 Carnegie Center Properties, which decreased interest expense



by approximately $15.9 million, and (3) an increase in capitalized interest costs which results in a decrease of interest expense of approximately $18.5
million. These decreases were offset by (1) an increase of approximately $4.4 million related to interest paid on the $450 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2006 by our Operating Partnership at a per
annum interest rate of 3.75%, (2) an increase of approximately $26.2 million related to interest paid on the $862.5 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2007 by our Operating Partnership at an effective per
annum interest rate of 3.438% and (3) an increase of approximately $4.3 million related to the acquisition of Kingstowne Towne Center on March 30, 2007 as well as the consolidation of our 505 9

th

joint venture property due to the involvement we now have because the property is operational. The remaining decrease is attributed to scheduled loan amortization on our outstanding
debt.

At December 31, 2007, our variable rate debt
consisted of our construction loan at South of Market. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006:

Portfolio increased approximately $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in depreciation and amortization consisted of approximately $20.6 million related to the 2007 acquisitions compared with the
2006 activity, approximately $0.7 million related to partially placing in-service 505 9th Street in the fourth quarter of 2007, approximately $1.3 million related to placing Capital Gallery into service during the third quarter of 2006, and
approximately $0.7 million was due to the placing in-service of our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. The increase was offset by reductions in depreciation
and amortization resulting from the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 compared with 280 Park Avenue in 2006, which resulted in an aggregate decrease of approximately $15.3 million. Depreciation and amortization in the Same
Property Portfolio increased approximately $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006.

Capitalized Costs

Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real
estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized
wages for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $11.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and



administrative expenses discussed above. We expect capitalized wages to increase proportionately with our increased development activity and increased wages
into 2008. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $31.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above.

Losses from early extinguishments of debt

On February 12, 2007, we refinanced our mortgage loan collateralized by
599 Lexington Avenue located in New York City. The new mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the new loan were used to
refinance the $225.0 million mortgage loan on 599 Lexington Avenue and the $475.0 million mortgage loan on Times Square Tower. In connection with the refinancing, the lien of the Times Square Tower mortgage was spread to 599 Lexington Avenue
and released from Times Square Tower so that Times Square Tower is no longer encumbered by any mortgage debt. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling
approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

In conjunction with the sale of Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland on August 7, 2007, we repaid the mortgage financing collateralized by the
property totaling approximately $94.6 million. We paid a prepayment fee of approximately $2.6 million associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $2.7 million consisting of the
prepayment fee and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, in connection with the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we legally defeased the mortgage indebtedness collateralized by the property, totaling approximately $254.4 million. In
connection with the legal defeasance of the mortgage indebtedness at 280 Park Avenue, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $31.4 million consisting of the difference between the value of the U.S. Treasuries
and the principal balance of the mortgage loan totaling approximately $28.2 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling approximately $3.2 million. In addition, we repaid construction financing collateralized by our
Seven Cambridge Center property. The construction financing at Seven Cambridge Center totaling approximately $112.5 million was repaid using approximately $7.5 million of available cash and $105.0 million drawn under our Unsecured Line of Credit.
There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment for Seven Cambridge Center. We recognized losses from early extinguishments of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing
costs. We repaid the construction and permanent financing at Capital Gallery totaling approximately $34.0 million and $49.7 million using available cash. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.2 million
comprised of a prepayment penalty and the write-off of unamortized deferred finance costs.

Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

For the year ended December 31, 2007, income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $4.1 million. On June 1, 2007, our Value-Added Fund sold Worldgate Plaza located in Herndon, Virginia
for approximately $109.0 million. Worldgate Plaza is an office complex consisting of approximately 322,000 net rentable square feet. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $50.5 million, of which our share was approximately $20.3 million, after the
repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of $57.0 million. Our share of the gain, which is included as income from joint ventures, was approximately $15.5 million which amount reflects the achievement of certain return thresholds as provided for in
the joint venture agreement. On October 1, 2007, our 505 9th Street joint venture project, a 323,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in Washington, D.C was partially placed in-service. In connection with partially
placing this property in-service, we consolidated this entity as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational.



On September 15, 2006, a joint venture in which we had a 35% interest sold 265 Franklin Street
located in Boston, Massachusetts, at a sale price of approximately $170.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $108.3 million, of which our share was approximately $37.9 million, after the repayment of mortgage indebtedness of
approximately $60.8 million and unfunded tenant obligations and other closing costs of approximately $0.9 million. The venture recognized a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $51.4 million, of which our share was approximately $18.0
million, and a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.2 million, of which our share was $0.1 million.

Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest

Marriott were included as part of income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest.

Minority interests in property partnerships

Minority interests in property partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2007 consists of
the outside equity interests in the venture that owns our Wisconsin Place Office Property as well as our 505 9

th

Street project. In connection with
partially placing 505 9

th

Street in-service, we consolidated this entity as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture
once the property is operational.

For the year ended
December 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership includes our outside equity interest in Citigroup Center. This venture was consolidated with our financial results because we exercised control over the entity. Due to the redemption
of the minority interest holder at Citigroup Center on May 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership no longer reflects an allocation to the minority interest holder.

Minority interest in Operating Partnership

Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to
2006. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 17, 2007 payable on January 30, 2008, holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2008 distribution
payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series
Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $8.7 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2007. In connection
with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 and paid on January 30, 2007, we recognized an adjustment of approximately $3.1 million in 2007 to the special cash distribution accrual and allocation of earnings to the Series Two
Preferred Units, as a result of conversions of Series Two Preferred Units. This decrease was offset by an increase related to the minority interest in our Operating Partnership’s income allocation related to an underlying
increase in allocable income.

In connection with the special
dividend declared on December 15, 2006 payable on January 30, 2007, holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2007 distribution payment as provided for in the
Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have
allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.2 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2006.



Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest

On August 7, 2007, we sold Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for
approximately $280.5 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $184.5 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of approximately $94.6 million and closing costs of approximately $1.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of
approximately $168.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $29.9 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been
categorized as discontinued operations.

On February 15,
2007, we sold the long-term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City and related credits, for approximately $1.28 billion in cash. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $1.23 billion, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately
$605.4 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $108.1 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as
discontinued operations.

On June 6, 2006, we sold 280
Park Avenue, a 1,179,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in midtown Manhattan, New York, for approximately $1.2 billion. Net proceeds totaled approximately $875 million after legal defeasance of indebtedness secured by
the property (consisting of approximately $254.4 million of principal indebtedness and approximately $28.2 million of related defeasance costs) and the payment of transfer taxes, brokers’ fees and other customary closing costs. We recognized at
closing a gain on sale of approximately $583.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $109.2 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this
property has not been categorized as discontinued operations.

In January 2006, we recognized a $4.8 million gain (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.9 million) on the sale of a parcel of land at the Prudential Center located in Boston, Massachusetts which had been accounted for
previously as a financing transaction. During January 2006, the transaction qualified as a sale for financial reporting purposes.

2006 and 2005 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $33,014 and $29,650, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $24,966 and $22,776, respectively, per the Consolidated Income Statement.



Rental Revenue

The increase of approximately $7.5 million in the Total Property Portfolio Rental Revenue is comprised of increases and decreases within the five
categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $33.3 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $72.2 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $15.5
million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $23.7 million and Properties Repositioned increased approximately $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005.

Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $33.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in base rental revenue of approximately $35.5 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $17.5
million in straight-line rents, primarily due to the reduction of free rent at Times Square Tower during the prior year. Approximately $14.2 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants
which correlates with the increase in operating expenses. Approximately $1.0 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income.

The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to placing in-service our Seven Cambridge Center
development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we placed our West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development into service which is included as

The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006 and
Embarcadero Center West Tower, Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street during 2005. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property through
agreements entered into at the time of sale. Rental Revenue from Properties Sold decreased by approximately $72.2 million, as detailed below:

approximately $8.5 million due to increased real estate tax assessments, with more than half of this increase specifically attributed to properties located in New York City. The remaining $10.2 million increase in the Same Property Portfolio
operating expenses is related to an increase in repairs and maintenance.

The acquisitions of Prospect Place on December 30, 2005, 303 Almaden Boulevard on June 30, 2006, 3200 Zanker Road on August 10, 2006 and Four and Five Cambridge Center on November 30, 2006
increased operating expenses from Properties Acquired by approximately $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as detailed below:

Development and Management Services

Development and Management Services income increased approximately
$2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Management Service income has increased approximately $1.6 million due to management contracts following the sales of 100 East Pratt Street, Riverfront Plaza and Embarcadero
Center West Tower in 2005, as well as the sale of 280 Park Avenue on June 6, 2006. Approximately $0.5 million of the increase related to tenant improvement construction management fees earned, the majority of which was in San Francisco. An
increase in development income of approximately $0.4 million was due to the increasing development activity at our 505 9

th

Street joint venture
project.

Interest and Other Income

Interest and other income increased by approximately $24.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of higher overall interest rates and increased cash balances. During the second quarter of 2006, we issued $450 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036. On June 6, 2006,
we completed the sale of 280 Park Avenue for net cash proceeds of approximately $875 million. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2006, including 280 Park Avenue and 265 Franklin Street.

Other Expenses

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. An overall
increase of approximately $4.7 million was attributed to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 and approximately $1.5 million related to tax savings during 2005. These increases were offset by approximately
$2.1 million of decreased accounting- and legal-related expenses, and other overall decreases aggregating approximately $0.2 million.

Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our
primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees generally vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five-year term (for awards granted prior to
2003, vesting is in equal annual installments; for those granted in 2003 through 2006, vesting occurs over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted in 2007, vesting will occur in equal annual
installments over a four-year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that
were issued in January 2005 and all subsequent LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the
corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to “stock-based compensation.” Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $11.4 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2005 and
approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vest.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The
majority of the decreases are due to (1) the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006, Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street in the second quarter of 2005, and Embarcadero Center
West Tower in October 2005, which collectively decreased interest expense by $20.4 million and (2) the repayment of our mortgage loans collateralized by Capital Gallery, Montvale Center, 101 Carnegie Center, 191 Spring Street and 601 and 651
Gateway Boulevard, which decreased interest expense approximately $8.2 million. These decreases were offset by (1) increases of



approximately $8.6 million at Times Square Tower due to increasing interest rates (5.85% on December 31, 2006 and 4.87% on December 31, 2005) and
the increased principal balance due to the refinancing of the mortgage loan in June 2005, (2) an increase of approximately $12.3 million related to interest paid on the $450 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 issued in the
second quarter of 2006 by our Operating Partnership and (3) a net increase of approximately $1.2 million due to the interest imputed on the unpaid redemption price related to the redemption of the outside members’ equity interest at
Citigroup Center to reflect the fair value of debt as well as the impact of placing Seven Cambridge Center into service prior to the repayment of debt. The remaining decrease is attributed to scheduled loan amortization on our outstanding debt.

At December 31, 2006, our variable rate debt consisted of
our construction loan at Times Square Tower, South of Market and our secured borrowings under our unsecured line of credit. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2006 compared with December 31, 2005:

Depreciation and
Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense for
the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in depreciation and amortization consisted of approximately $7.3 million due to the placing in-service of our
Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006, approximately $6.8 million related to the acquisition of Prospect Place on December 30, 2005, 303 Almaden Boulevard
on June 30, 2006, 3200 Zanker Road on August 10, 2006 and Four and Five Cambridge Center in November 2006, and approximately $1.4 million related to placing Capital Gallery into service during the third quarter. The increase was offset by
reductions in depreciation and amortization resulting from the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006 and Embarcadero Center West Tower, 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in 2005, which resulted in an aggregate decrease of approximately
$14.2 million. Depreciation and amortization in the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005.

Capitalized Costs

Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real
estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other



project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $7.0 million and $5.9
million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $5.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively. These costs are
not included in the interest expense referenced above.

Losses from early extinguishments of debt

For
the year ended December 31, 2006, in connection with the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we legally defeased the mortgage indebtedness collateralized by the property, totaling approximately $254.4 million. In connection with the legal defeasance of
the mortgage indebtedness at 280 Park Avenue, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $31.4 million consisting of the difference between the value of the U.S. Treasuries and the principal balance of the mortgage
loan totaling approximately $28.2 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling approximately $3.2 million. In addition, we repaid construction financing collateralized by our Seven Cambridge Center property. The
construction financing at Seven Cambridge Center totaling approximately $112.5 million was repaid using approximately $7.5 million of available cash and $105.0 million drawn under our Unsecured Line of Credit. There was no prepayment penalty
associated with the repayment for Seven Cambridge Center. We recognized losses from early extinguishments of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. We repaid the construction and
permanent financing at Capital Gallery totaling approximately $34.0 million and $49.7 million using available cash. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.2 million comprised of a prepayment penalty and the
write-off of unamortized deferred finance costs. During 2006, we also repaid the mortgage loan collateralized by our Embarcadero Center Three property located in San Francisco, California totaling approximately $133.4 million, the mortgage loan
collateralized by our 191 Spring Street property located in Lexington, Massachusetts totaling approximately $17.9 million, the mortgage loan collateralized by our Montvale Center property located in Gaithersburg, Maryland totaling approximately $6.6
million and the mortgage loan collateralized by our 101 Carnegie Center property located in Princeton, New Jersey totaling approximately $6.6 million. There were no significant prepayment penalties or write-offs of unamortized deferred financing
costs related to these repayments.

In connection with the
sales of 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in May 2005, we repaid the mortgage loans collateralized by the properties totaling approximately $188 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss from early
extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $11.0 million, consisting of prepayment fees of approximately $10.8 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $0.2 million. We also recognized a $1.9 million loss
from early extinguishment of debt, which relates to the refinancing of our Times Square Tower mortgage loan and the modification on our Unsecured Line of Credit.

Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

On September 15, 2006, a joint venture in which we had a 35% interest sold 265 Franklin Street located in Boston,
Massachusetts, at a sale price of approximately $170.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $108.3 million, of which our share was approximately $37.9 million, after the repayment of mortgage indebtedness of approximately $60.8 million
and unfunded tenant obligations and other closing costs of approximately $0.9 million. The venture recognized a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $51.4 million, of which our share was approximately $18.0 million, and a loss from early
extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.2 million, of which our share was $0.1 million.

Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest

For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Orbital Sciences Campus, Broad Run, Building E, Long Wharf Marriott and Newport Office Park were included
as part of income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest. Properties included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of the Orbital Science Campus, Broad Run, Building E, Long Wharf Marriott,
Newport Office Park, 40-46 Harvard Street, the Residence Inn by Marriott and Old Federal Reserve.



Minority interest in property partnership

Minority interest in property partnership consists of the outside equity interests in the venture that owns Citigroup
Center. This venture was consolidated with our financial results because we exercised control over the entity. Due to the redemption of the minority interest holder’s interest at Citigroup Center on May 31, 2006, minority interest in
property partnership will no longer reflect an allocation to the minority interest holder.

Minority interest in Operating Partnership

Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 payable on
January 30, 2007, holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2007 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement. As a
result, we accrued approximately $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of
approximately $12.2 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2006.

In connection with the special cash distribution declared in July 2005, holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated on an as-converted basis in
connection with their regular February 2006 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to the
special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.1 million, which amount is reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the
year ended December 31, 2005. This decrease was offset by an increase related to the minority interest in our Operating Partnership’s income allocation related to an underlying increase in allocable income.

Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest

On June 6, 2006, we sold 280 Park Avenue, a 1,179,000 net rentable
square foot Class A office property located in midtown Manhattan, New York, for approximately $1.2 billion. Net proceeds totaled approximately $875 million after legal defeasance of indebtedness secured by the property (consisting of
approximately $254.4 million of principal indebtedness and approximately $28.2 million of related defeasance costs) and the payment of transfer taxes, brokers’ fees and other customary closing costs. We recognized at closing a gain on sale of
approximately $583.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $109.2 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been
categorized as discontinued operations.

In January 2006, we
recognized a $4.8 million gain (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.9 million) on the sale of a parcel of land at the Prudential Center located in Boston, Massachusetts which had been accounted for previously as a financing
transaction. During January 2006, the transaction qualified as a sale for financial reporting purposes.

Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio primarily relate to the sales of Riverfront Plaza
and 100 East Street which are not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of these properties after the sales. In addition, the sale of Decoverly Four and Five, consisting of two
undeveloped land parcels located in Rockville, Maryland are included in gains on sales of real estate and other assets for the year ended December 31, 2005. Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the
property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations.



Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest

Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year
ended December 31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sale of Old Federal Reserve in April 2005, Residence Inn by Marriott and 40-46 Harvard Street, both which were sold in November 2005.

Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN 47”). FIN 47 clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used
in FASB Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
or may not be within the control of the entity. At December 31, 2005, we recognized a liability for the fair value of the asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $7.1 million, which amount is included in “Accounts
Payable and Accrued Expenses” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we have recognized the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is included in “Cumulative Effect of a
Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to:

•

fund normal recurring expenses;

•

meet debt service and principal repayment obligations including balloon payments on maturing debt;

•

fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs;

•

fund current development costs not covered under construction loans;

•

fund the costs associated with the settlement of our hedge agreements at maturity;

•

fund possible property acquisitions; and

•

make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

On December 17, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a special cash
dividend of $5.98 per common share that was paid on January 30, 2008 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2007. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2007,
including 5 Times Square, Orbital Sciences Campus, Broad Run Business Park - Building E, Worldgate Plaza and Newport Office Park. The Board of Directors did not make any change in our policy with respect to regular quarterly dividends. The payment
of the regular quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share and the special dividend of $5.98 per share resulted in a total payment of $6.66 per share paid on January 30, 2008.

We believe that our liquidity needs during 2008, including approximately $451.0 million of estimated development costs, will
be satisfied using our approximately $750 million of cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our line of credit (currently $582.9 million) and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We may also generate cash
from asset sales. Base rental revenue, recovery income from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances, draws on our unsecured line of credit and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to
pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification.



We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit
increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses.
Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short-term liquidity needs. However, material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash
flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with
the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes.

Our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the costs of developments, possible property acquisitions, scheduled debt
maturities, major renovations, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:

•

construction loans;

•

long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness);

•

income from operations;

•

income from joint ventures;

•

sales of real estate;

•

issuances of our equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in BPLP; and

•

our unsecured revolving line of credit or other short-term bridge facilities.

We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. Our unsecured line of credit is utilized
primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short-term development and working capital needs. We generally fund our development projects with construction loans that may be
partially guaranteed by BPLP, our Operating Partnership, until project completion or lease-up thresholds are achieved.

To the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at
the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including,
among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would
distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales.

Cash Flow Summary

The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.



Cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion and $725.8 million at December 31, 2007 and
December 31, 2006, respectively, representing an increase of $781.1 million. The increase was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows:

Our principal source
of cash flow is related to the operation of our office properties. The average term of our tenant leases is approximately 7.4 years with occupancy rates historically in the range of 92% to 98%. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream
of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. In addition, over the past two years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our
properties and raised proceeds from secured and unsecured borrowings.

In 2007, our total dividends exceeded our cash flow from operating activities due to the special dividend which was declared in December 2006 and paid to common stockholders and common unitholders of BPLP on January 30, 2007. The cash
flows distributed were generated from sales of real estate assets and proceeds from the sales are included as part of cash flows from investment activities. We expect that in 2008 our total dividends will exceed our cash flow from operating
activities due to the special dividend declared in December 2007. Dividends will generally exceed cash flows from operating activities during periods in which we sell significant real estate assets and distribute gains on sale that would otherwise
be taxable.

Cash is used in investing activities to fund
acquisitions, development and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing
buildings that meet our investment criteria. Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted of the following:

Cash used in financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled approximately $425.2 million. This consisted primarily of the $840 million of net proceeds from our offering of 2.875% unsecured exchangeable senior notes and proceeds from mortgage notes
payable, offset by the repayment of our Embarcadero Center Four mortgage loan, Times Square Tower mortgage loan and other mortgage notes payable, our secured draw under our Unsecured Line of Credit, as well as the payments of dividends and
distributions to shareholders and the unitholders of our Operating Partnership. Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading “Debt Financing.”



Capitalization

At December 31, 2007, our total consolidated debt was approximately $5.5 billion. The GAAP weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated
indebtedness was 5.60% and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.2 years.

Debt to total market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage
commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Our total market capitalization was approximately $18.5 billion at December 31, 2007. Total market capitalization was calculated using the December 31, 2007 closing stock price of $91.81 per
common share and the following: (1) 119,502,485 shares of our common stock, (2) 20,271,341 outstanding common units of limited partnership of BPLP (excluding common units held by Boston Properties, Inc.), (3) an aggregate of 1,460,688
common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding preferred units of partnership interest in BPLP, (4) an aggregate of 676,067 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP units, assuming all conditions have been met for
the conversion of the LTIP units, and (5) our consolidated debt totaling approximately $5.5 billion. Our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2007 represented approximately 29.66% of our total market capitalization. This percentage will
fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours,
whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the debt to total market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various
components of our outstanding indebtedness.

Debt Financing

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately
$5.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness, representing 29.66% of our total market capitalization as calculated above consisting of (1) $1.472 billion (net of discount) in publicly traded unsecured debt having a weighted-average interest rate of
5.95% per annum and maturities in 2013 and 2015; (2) $450 million of publicly traded exchangeable unsecured debt having an interest rate of 3.75% per annum, an initial optional redemption date in 2013 and maturity in 2036;
(3) $844.1 million (net of discount) of publicly traded exchangeable unsecured debt having an interest rate of 2.875% per annum (an effective rate of 3.438% per annum) having an initial optional redemption in 2012 and maturing in
2037; and (4) $2.7 billion of property-specific mortgage debt having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 6.32% per annum and weighted-average term of 5.1 years. The table below summarizes our mortgage notes payable, our senior
unsecured notes and our Unsecured Line of Credit at December 31, 2007 and 2006:



The variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various spreads over the London Interbank
Offered Rate or Eurodollar rates. As of December 31, 2007, the interest rate on our variable rate debt was LIBOR/Eurodollar plus 1.25% per annum. On September 27, 2007, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the
one-month LIBOR index rate at 5.82% per annum on a notional amount of $96.7 million. On February 12, 2007, we repaid $700 million of variable rate indebtedness which was outstanding at December 31, 2006 consisting of (1) the
$225.0 million draw on our Unsecured Line of Credit, which draw was collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue, and (2) the mortgage loan collateralized by Times Square Tower totaling $475.0 million. The variable rate indebtedness was repaid with
proceeds from a new mortgage financing secured by 599 Lexington Avenue totaling $750.0 million, which bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017. On December 19, 2006, we terminated our
forward-starting interest rate swap contracts that we had entered into in connection with the expected new mortgage financing and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount will reduce our interest expense over the ten-year term of the
financing, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.38% per annum.

Unsecured Line of Credit

On August 3, 2006, we modified our $605.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Unsecured Line of Credit”) by extending the maturity date from October 30, 2007 to August 3, 2010, with a provision for a
one-year extension at our option, subject to certain conditions, and by reducing the per annum variable interest rate on outstanding balances from Eurodollar plus 0.65% to Eurodollar plus 0.55% per annum. Under the Unsecured Line of Credit, a
facility fee equal to 15 basis points per annum is payable in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in our Operating Partnership’s unsecured debt ratings. Based on our
current debt ratings, the per annum variable interest rate is Eurodollar plus 0.475%. In addition, we pay a facility fee payable quarterly of 0.125% per annum. The Unsecured Line of Credit involves a syndicate of lenders. The Unsecured Line of
Credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to the Company at a negotiated LIBOR-based rate. The Unsecured Line of Credit is available to fund working capital and
general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to fund development of properties, land and property acquisitions and to repay or reduce indebtedness. The Unsecured Line of Credit is a recourse obligation of Boston Properties Limited
Partnership.

Our ability to borrow under our Unsecured Line of
Credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including:

•

a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days;

•

a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%;

•

a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40;

•

an unsecured leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180
days;

•

a minimum net worth requirement;

•

an unsecured debt interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75; and

•

limitations on permitted investments.

We believe we are in compliance with the financial and other covenants listed above.

As of December 31, 2007, we had no amount outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit with the ability to borrow
$582.9 million. As of February 22, 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Unsecured Line of Credit.



Unsecured Senior Notes

The following summarizes the unsecured senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands):

(1)

Yield on issuance date including the effects of discounts on the notes.

(2)

No principal amounts are due prior to maturity.

Our unsecured senior notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of their
principal amount or (2) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at a rate equal to the yield on U.S. Treasury securities with a comparable maturity plus 35 basis points (or 25 basis
points in the case of the $250 million 12 Year Unsecured Senior Notes that mature on June 1, 2015), in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The indenture under which our senior unsecured notes were issued contains
restrictions on incurring debt and using our assets as security in other financing transactions and other customary financial and other covenants, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to
exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of 1.5, and (4) unencumbered asset value to be no less than 150% of our unsecured debt. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and
requirements.

BPLP’s investment grade ratings on its
senior unsecured notes are as follows:

The security rating is
not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, as it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Unsecured exchangeable senior notes

3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2036

On April 6, 2006, our Operating Partnership completed a public offering
of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036. On May 2, 2006, the Operating Partnership issued an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of the notes as a result of the exercise by the
underwriter of its over-allotment option. The notes mature on May 15, 2036, unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or redeemed.

Upon the occurrence of specified events, holders of the notes may exchange their notes prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day
immediately preceding May 18, 2013 into cash and, at the Operating Partnership’s option, shares of our common stock at an exchange rate of 10.0066 shares per $1,000 principal



amount of notes (or an exchange price of approximately $99.93 per share of common stock). The initial exchange rate of 8.9461 shares per $1,000 principal
amount of notes and the initial exchange price of approximately $111.78 per share of our common stock were adjusted to 9.3900 and $106.50, respectively, effective as of December 29, 2006 in connection with the special dividend declared on
December 15, 2006. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 17, 2007, the exchange rate was further adjusted from 9.3900 to 10.0066 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as of December 31, 2007,
resulting in the current exchange price of approximately $99.93 per share of our common stock. On and after May 18, 2013, the notes will be exchangeable at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately
preceding the maturity date at the option of the holder at the applicable exchange rate. The exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

Prior to May 18, 2013, the Operating Partnership may not redeem the notes except to preserve our status as a REIT. On or after May 18, 2013, the
Operating Partnership may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Operating Partnership must make at least 12 semi-annual interest payments
(including interest payments on November 15, 2006 and May 15, 2013) before redeeming any notes at the option of the Operating Partnership. Note holders may require the Operating Partnership to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on
May 18, 2013 and May 15 of 2016, 2021, 2026 and 2031 at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all
notes so repurchased.

If we undergo a “fundamental
change,” note holders will have the option to require the Operating Partnership to purchase all or any portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so purchased. In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to May 18, 2013, the Operating Partnership will increase the
exchange rate for a holder who elects to exchange its notes in connection with such a fundamental change under certain circumstances.

2.875% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2037

On February 6, 2007, our Operating Partnership completed an offering of $862.5 million in aggregate principal amount (including $112.5 million as a
result of the exercise by the initial purchasers of their over-allotment option) of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037. The notes were priced at 97.433333% of their face amount, resulting in an effective interest rate of approximately
3.438% per annum and net proceeds to us of approximately $840.0 million. The notes mature on February 15, 2037, unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or redeemed.

Upon the occurrence of specified events, holders of the notes may exchange their notes prior to the close of business on the
scheduled trading day immediately preceding February 20, 2012 into cash and, at the Operating Partnership’s option, shares of our common stock at an exchange rate of 7.0430 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or an exchange price
of approximately $141.98 per share of our common stock). In connection with the special dividend declared on December 17, 2007, the initial exchange rate of 6.6090 was adjusted to 7.0430 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as
of December 31, 2007, resulting in an exchange price of approximately $141.98 per share of our common stock. On and after February 20, 2012, the notes will be exchangeable at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading
day immediately preceding the maturity date at the option of the holder at the applicable exchange rate. The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

Prior to February 20, 2012, the Operating Partnership may not redeem the notes except to preserve our status as a REIT.
On or after February 20, 2012, the Operating Partnership may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Note holders may require the Operating
Partnership to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on February 15 of 2012, 2017, 2022, 2027 and 2032 at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The
Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so repurchased.



If we undergo a “fundamental change,” note holders will have the option to require the
Operating Partnership to purchase all or any portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date.
The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so purchased. In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to February 20, 2012, the Operating Partnership will increase the exchange rate for a holder who elects to exchange its notes
in connection with such a fundamental change under certain circumstances.

The Operating Partnership offered and sold the notes to the initial purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. The initial purchasers then
sold the notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

In connection with the closing, we and our Operating Partnership entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the initial purchasers, under which we
and our Operating Partnership agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and maintain a shelf registration statement providing for the sale by the holders of the notes and our common
stock, if any, issuable upon exchange of the notes. The Operating Partnership will be required to pay liquidated damages in the form of specified additional interest to the holders of the notes if we fail to comply with these obligations; provided
that we will not be required to pay liquidated damages with respect to any note after it has been exchanged for any of our common stock. On March 13, 2007, we filed with the SEC a registration statement covering the resale of the notes and
shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of the notes. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on April 20, 2007.

Mortgage Debt

The following represents the outstanding principal balances due under the mortgages notes payable at December 31, 2007:



(1)

GAAP interest rate differs from the stated interest rate due to the inclusion of the amortization of financing charges and adjustments required by EITF 98-1. All adjustments related
to EITF 98-1 are noted below.

(2)

On December 19, 2006, we terminated our forward-starting interest rate swap contracts and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount will reduce our interest expense
for this mortgage over the term of the financing, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.38% per annum for the financing. The stated interest rate is 5.57% per annum. The mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon
payment due at maturity.

(3)

In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rate shown were adjusted upon redemption of the outside members’ equity interest in the limited liability

balance at December 31, 2007 was $20.0 million and the stated interest rate was 5.96% per annum.

Combined aggregate principal payments of mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2007 are as follows (in thousands):

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and
interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable
rates. The fair



value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term,
fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and
permanent financing terms. Approximately 98% of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements
with financial institutions. Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing
transactions. This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy protects us against future increases in interest rates.

In July and August 2007, we entered into nine interest rate contracts, known as “treasury locks,” which fix
the 10-year treasury rate at a weighted-average rate of 4.74% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $325.0 million. The treasury locks fix the 10-year treasury rate for a long-term fixed-rate financing commencing in April
2008 and expiring in April 2018. We expect to settle the interest rate contracts at the time we lock the rate on long-term fixed-rate financing. If the 10-year treasury rate is below the fixed strike rate at the time we settle each
contract, we would be required to make a payment to the contract counterparties; if the 10-year treasury rate is above the fixed strike rate at the time we cash settle each contract, we would receive a payment from the contract
counterparties. The amount that we either pay or receive will equal the present value of the basis point differential between the applicable fixed strike rate and the 10-year treasury rate at the time we settle each
contract. These treasury locks qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended.

In August and September 2007, we entered into four forward-starting
interest rate swap contracts to lock in the 10-year treasury rate and 10-year swap spread. The swaps fixed the 10-year swap rate for a financing in July 2008 at a weighted-average rate of 5.21% per annum on notional amounts aggregating
$125.0 million. The 10-year treasury rate is a component of the 10-year swap rate and the swap contracts effectively fixed the 10-year treasury rate at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.53% per annum. The forward-starting swaps fix the
10-year swap rate for a long-term fixed-rate financing commencing in July 2008 and expiring in July 2018. We expect to settle the interest rate contracts in cash at the time we lock the rate on long-term fixed-rate financing. If the
10-year swap rate is below the fixed strike rate at the time we settle each contract, we would be required to make a payment to the contract counter-parties; if the 10-year swap rate is above the fixed strike rate at the time we
cash settle each contract, we would receive a payment from the contract counterparties. The amount that we either pay or receive will equal the present value of the basis point differential between the applicable fixed strike rate and
the 10-year swap rate at the time we settle each contract. We believe that these swaps qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as
amended.

On November 2, 2007, we entered into a
forward-starting interest rate swap contract to lock the 10-year LIBOR swap rate on a notional amount of $25.0 million at a forward-starting 10-year swap rate of 5.05% per annum. The 10-year treasury rate is a component of the 10-year swap rate
and the referenced contract effectively fixed the 10-year treasury rate at 4.38%. The swap contract goes into effect on July 31, 2008 and expires on July 31, 2018. On November 9, 2007 and November 16, 2007, we entered into
treasury locks to fix the 10-year treasury rate at 4.33% per annum on a notional amount of $25 million and 4.24% per annum on a notional amount of $25.0 million, respectively. The treasury locks mature on July 31, 2008.

We have effectively fixed the 10-year treasury rate at a weighted average
interest rate of 4.63% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $525.0 million with our interest rate hedging program.

On September 27, 2007, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate (including a 1.25% spread), at
5.82% per annum on a notional amount of $96.7 million. The swap contract went into effect on October 22, 2007 and expires on October 29, 2008.



We have recorded the changes in fair value of the treasury lock and swap contracts related to the
effective portion of the interest rate contracts executed during 2007 totaling a liability of approximately $25.7 million in Other Liabilities and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect that
within the next twelve months we will reclassify into earnings as interest expense approximately $2.1 million of the amounts recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) relating to the treasury lock contracts and forward-starting
interest rate swap contracts.

During 2005, we entered into
twelve forward-starting interest rate swap contracts to lock in the 10-year treasury rate and 10-year swap spreads. On December 19, 2006, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a lender for a fixed interest rate of
5.57% per annum on a ten-year mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million to be collateralized by our 599 Lexington Avenue property in New York City. We closed on the mortgage financing on February 12, 2007. In conjunction with the interest
rate lock agreement, we terminated the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount will reduce our interest expense over the ten-year term of the financing, resulting in an effective interest
rate of 5.38% per annum. Over the next twelve months we will reclassify into earnings as a reduction of interest expense approximately $1.1 million of the amounts recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) relating to the
forward-starting interest rate swap contracts.

At
December 31, 2007, our outstanding variable rate debt based off LIBOR totaled approximately $122.9 million, of which approximately $96.7 million is fixed at 5.82% due to the interest rate swap contract we entered into on September 27,
2007. At December 31, 2007, the interest rate on our unhedged variable rate debt was approximately 5.88%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately
$0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

At
December 31, 2006, our outstanding variable rate debt based off LIBOR totaled approximately $711 million. At December 31, 2006, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 5.80%. If market interest rates on our
variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of
specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.

Funds from Operations

Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, we calculate Funds from Operations, or
“FFO,” by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for
unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and preferred distributions. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of
operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance
because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based
on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO
reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amount represents our share, which was 85.32%, 84.40%, 83.74%,
82.97% and 82.06% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, after allocation to the minority interest in the Operating Partnership.



In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO, as
adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2003 which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts.

The adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of
debt results when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debt’s stated maturity and to write-off unamortized loan costs at the date of the extinguishment. Such costs are excluded
from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP. However, we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost of the sale transactions because we
extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions. We believe that this supplemental adjustment more appropriately reflects the results of our
operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions.

The adjustment for net derivative losses related to non-qualifying derivative contracts for the year ended December 31, 2003 resulted from interest rate contracts we entered into prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to
limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to variable rate debt associated with real estate projects under development. Upon transition to SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, the impacts of these contracts were
recorded in current earnings, while prior to that time they were capitalized. Although these adjustments were attributable to a single hedging program, the underlying contracts extended over multiple reporting periods and therefore resulted in
adjustments through the third quarter of 2003. Management presents FFO before the impact of non-qualifying derivative contracts because economically this interest rate hedging program was consistent with our risk management objective of limiting our
exposure to interest rate volatility and the change in accounting under GAAP did not correspond to a substantive difference. Management does not currently anticipate structuring future hedging programs in a manner that would give rise to this kind
of adjustment.

Although our FFO, as adjusted, clearly differs
from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that, by excluding the effects
of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more
closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO.

Neither FFO, nor FFO as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, represent cash
generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO, as adjusted
should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.



The following table presents a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to FFO and
FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003:

(1)

Real estate depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation and amortization from the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $286,030, $270,562, $260,979, $244,589 and
$201,690, our share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization of $8,247, $9,087, $8,554, $6,814 and $8,475, and depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations of $2,948, $6,197, $6,662, $8,352 and $8,787,
less corporate related depreciation and amortization of $1,590, $1,584, $1,719, $2,436 and $2,717 and adjustment of asset retirement obligations of $0, $912, $0, $0 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

(2)

Excludes approximately $15.5 million related to our share of the gain on sale and related loss from early extinguishment of debt associated with the sale of Worldgate Plaza for the
year ended December 31, 2007. Excludes approximately $17.9 million related to our share of the gain on sale and related loss from early extinguishment of debt associated with the sale of 265 Franklin Street for the year ended December 31,
2006.

(3)

Excludes approximately $5.6 million, $12.2 million and $12.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, of income allocated to the holders of
Series Two Preferred Units to account for their right to participate on an as-converted basis in the special dividends that followed previously completed sales of real estate.



Reconciliation to Diluted Funds from Operations:

(1)

Excludes approximately $5.6 million, $12.2 million and $12.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, of income allocated to the holders of
Series Two Preferred Units to account for their right to participate on an as-converted basis in the special dividends that followed previously completed sales of real estate.

(2)

Our share of diluted Funds from Operations was 85.69%, 85.06%, 84.60%, 84.01% and 83.45% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.



Net Operating Income

Net operating income, or “NOI,” is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure, plus minority interest in Operating Partnership, net derivative losses, losses from early extinguishments of debt, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest), depreciation and
amortization, interest expense and general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real
estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interests in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a
performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we
believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.

Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is
useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis,
providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property’s results of operations. For example, interest expense is
not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful
life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs and real estate companies that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear
understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or
to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.

The following sets forth a reconciliation of NOI to net income available to common shareholders for the fiscal years 2003 through 2007.



Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2007, we were subject to contractual payment obligations as described in the table below.

(1)

Amounts include principal and interest payments.

(2)

Committed tenant-related obligations based on executed leases as of December 31, 2007 (tenant improvements and lease commissions).

(3)

Represents revenue support obligations and master lease obligations related to the sales of 5 Times Square in February 2007 and 280 Park in June 2006 as well as the remaining
obligation related to our redemption of partnership interests in Citigroup Center.

We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other utility
contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year and that vary based on usage. These contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation
with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally one year or less.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Joint Ventures

We have investments in
eight unconsolidated joint ventures (including our investment in the Value-Added Fund) with our effective ownership interests ranging from 23.89% to 51%, all of which have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not
control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2007, the debt related to these ventures was equal to
approximately $565.6 million. The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at December 31, 2007:



(1)

The financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum.

(2)

This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund.

(3)

Amount represents outstanding construction financing under a $96.5 million loan commitment (of which our share is $23.1 million) at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus
1.50% per annum with a maturity in March 2009. The mortgage debt requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. On March 29, 2007, the entity executed an amendment to its construction loan agreement. The
outstanding balance on the construction loan was approximately $53.6 million of the $96.5 million commitment. The amended agreement provides for a reduction in the loan commitment amount to $69.1 million. The reduction relates to the repayment of
the retail portion of the outstanding balance totaling approximately $15.9 million and an additional reduction in the borrowing capacity of approximately $11.5 million with a corresponding release of collateral in conjunction with the retail entity
obtaining new construction financing. On January 29, 2008, the Wisconsin Place joint venture entity that owns and is developing the office component of the project obtained construction financing totaling approximately $115.0 million
collateralized by the office property. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum and matures on January 29, 2011 with two, one-year extension options.

(4)

In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rates shown were adjusted to reflect the fair value of the note using an effective interest rate of 4.38% per
annum. This note is non-interest bearing with a stated principal balance of $7.5 million and matures in January 2008. On February 1, 2008 the joint venture repaid this loan.

(5)

Amount represents outstanding construction financing under a $66.0 million loan commitment collateralized by the retail entity of Wisconsin Place. Wisconsin Place is a mixed-use
development project consisting of office, retail and residential properties located in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and matures on March 29, 2010
with two one-year extension options.

Environmental Matters

It is our policy to retain independent environmental
consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase
environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of
environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental
testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action.

In February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to
contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of
construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring
and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various
defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.

Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified
groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory
authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the



properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at
a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source
properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). Other than periodic testing at some of these properties,
no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time.

Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly,
it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory
closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and
special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt
batching facility, which we may develop in the future. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental
conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The
submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws.

We expect that resolution of the environmental matters
relating to the above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all
necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.

Newly Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109” (“FIN No. 48”). FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on description, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN No. 48, which we adopted effective January 1, 2007, did not have a material impact on our cash flows, results of
operations, financial position or liquidity.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that
are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The FASB also removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a
material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.



In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure many financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating and assessing the impact of this statement.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141(R)”),
which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer shall recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a
business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently
assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on our financial position and results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an Amendment of ARB
No. 51” (“SFAS No. 160”), which establishes and expands accounting and reporting standards for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests, in a subsidiary and the deconsolidation of a
subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. This statement is effective for
fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our financial position and results of operations.

Inflation

Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount.
In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations.



Item

7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

As of December 31, 2007, approximately $5.4 billion of our borrowings bore interest at fixed rates, and therefore the
fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates. The following table presents our aggregate fixed rate debt obligations as of December 31, 2007 with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by
maturity date and our aggregate variable rate debt obligations sorted by maturity date. The GAAP weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of December 31, 2007 was 6.11% per annum.

Additional disclosure
about market risk is incorporated herein by reference from “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Market Risk.”

Management’s Report on Internal Control over

Financial Reporting

Management of Boston Properties, Inc. (“the Company”) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As of the
end of the Company’s 2007 fiscal year, management conducted assessments of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on these assessments, management has determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 was effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the
directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 88, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Boston Properties, Inc.:

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Properties, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and December 31,
2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing on page 87. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the
financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.”

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1.    Organization and Basis of Presentation

Organization

Boston
Properties, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”). The Company is the sole general partner of Boston Properties Limited Partnership (the
“Operating Partnership”) and at December 31, 2007 owned an approximate 84.2% (83.3% at December 31, 2006) general and limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. Partnership interests in the Operating Partnership
are denominated as “common units of partnership interest” (also referred to as “OP Units”), “long term incentive units of partnership interest” (also referred to as “LTIP Units”) or “preferred units of
partnership interest” (also referred to as “Preferred Units”).

Unless specifically noted otherwise, all references to OP Units exclude units held by the Company. A holder of an OP Unit may present such OP Unit to the Operating Partnership for redemption at any time (subject to
restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such redemption right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, the Operating
Partnership must redeem such OP Unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of common stock of the Company (“Common Stock”). In lieu of a cash redemption, the Company may elect to acquire such OP Unit for one share of Common Stock.
Because the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at all times equals the number of OP Units that the Company owns, one share of Common Stock is generally the economic equivalent of one OP Unit, and the quarterly distribution that may be paid
to the holder of an OP Unit equals the quarterly dividend that may be paid to the holder of a share of Common Stock. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of restricted common stock of the Company. LTIP Units, whether vested
or not, will receive the same quarterly per unit distributions as OP Units, which equal per share dividends on Common Stock (See Note 17).

At December 31, 2007, there was one series of Preferred Units outstanding (i.e., Series Two Preferred Units). The Series Two Preferred Units bear a
distribution that is set in accordance with an amendment to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Preferred Units may also be converted into OP Units at the election of the holder thereof or the Operating Partnership in accordance
with the amendment to the partnership agreement (See Note 11).

All references to the Company refer to Boston Properties, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires.

Properties

At December 31, 2007, the Company owned or had interests in a portfolio
of 139 commercial real estate properties (131 properties at December 31, 2006) (the “Properties”) aggregating approximately 43.8 million net rentable square feet (approximately 43.4 million net rentable square feet at
December 31, 2006), including 13 properties under construction totaling approximately 3.9 million net rentable square feet, and structured parking for approximately 32,054 vehicles containing approximately 9.9 million square feet. At
December 31, 2007, the Properties consist of:

•

135 office properties, including 115 Class A office properties (including 13 properties under construction) and 20 Office/Technical properties;

•

one hotel; and

•

three retail properties.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company owns or controls undeveloped land parcels totaling approximately 605.2 acres. In
addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had a 25% interest in the Boston Properties Office Value-Added Fund, L.P. (the “Value-Added Fund”), which is a strategic partnership with two institutional investors through which the
Company has pursued the acquisition of value-added investments in assets within its existing markets. The Company’s investments through the Value-Added Fund are not included in its portfolio information or any other portfolio level statistics.
At December 31, 2007, the Value-Added Fund had investments in an office property in Chelmsford, Massachusetts and an office complex in San Carlos, California.

The Company considers Class A office properties to be centrally located buildings that are professionally managed and
maintained, that attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings. The Company considers Office/Technical properties to be properties that
support office, research and development, laboratory and other technical uses. Net rentable square feet amounts are unaudited.

Basis of Presentation

Boston Properties, Inc. does not have any other significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its investment in the Operating Partnership, nor
does it have employees of its own. The Operating Partnership, not Boston Properties, Inc., executes all significant business relationships. All majority-owned subsidiaries and affiliates over which the Company has financial and operating control and
variable interest entities (“VIE”s) in which the Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary are included in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The Company accounts for all other unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the Company’s share of the earnings of these joint ventures and companies is included in consolidated net
income.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”). In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which
amended FIN 46. FIN 46R was effective immediately for arrangements entered into after January 31, 2003, and became effective during the first quarter of 2004 for all arrangements entered into before February 1, 2003. FIN 46R requires
existing unconsolidated VIEs to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses or receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or
both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership interests, contractual interests, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable
interests. Prior to FIN 46R, the Company included an entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests.

2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Real Estate

Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant
improvements, “above-” and “below-market” leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations”), and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. The Company assesses and
considers fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors
including the historical operating results, known



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property
as if it were vacant. The Company also considers an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and
extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenant’s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on its acquisitions to date, the Company’s allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been
immaterial.

The Company records acquired “above-”
and “below-market” leases at their fair value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease
and (2) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market
fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Company’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease. Factors to be
considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes real estate taxes, insurance
and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, the Company considers leasing commissions, legal
and other related expenses.

Real estate is stated at
depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include
interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development.

The Company reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment
in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset
over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future
periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be “long-lived assets to be held and used,” as defined by SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” (“SFAS No. 144”)
are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, the Company’s established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If the
Company’s strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be
reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date.

SFAS No. 144, requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as “held for sale,” be presented as discontinued operations in all
periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and the Company will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the property’s net income that is reflected as discontinued
operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). The Company generally considers assets to be
“held for sale” when the transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered
probable. Following the classification of a property as “held for sale,” no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After
determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment.
The Company’s capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 “Capitalization of Interest Cost” and SFAS No. 67 “Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate
Projects.” The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs,
interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of
tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. The Company ceases capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalizes
only those costs associated with the portion under construction. Interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $31.0 million, $5.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Salaries and related costs
capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $6.9 million, $4.2 million and $3.9 million, respectively.

The acquisitions of minority interests (i.e., OP Units) for shares of the Company’s common stock are recorded under the purchase method with assets
acquired reflected at the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of acquisition. The acquisition amounts are allocated to the underlying assets based on their estimated fair values.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as
incurred. Significant betterments are capitalized. When assets are sold or retired, their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses reflected in net income or loss for the period.

Certain of the Company’s real estate assets contain
asbestos. Although the asbestos is appropriately encapsulated, in accordance with current environmental regulations, the Company’s practice is to remediate the asbestos upon the renovation or redevelopment of its properties. In March 2005, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN 47”). FIN 47 clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement
obligation” as used in FASB Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on
a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement. FIN 47 requires an
entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be
recognized when incurred—generally upon the acquisition, construction, or development and/or through the normal operation of an asset. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value
of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 became effective and was adopted by the Company on December 31, 2005. Upon adoption, the Company recognized the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is
included in “Cumulative Effect of A Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest” on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005

The Company computes depreciation and amortization on properties using the
straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, the Company allocates the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired “above-” and
“below-market” leases, origination costs and acquired in-place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciates or amortizes these assets



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(or liabilities) over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired “above-” and “below-market” leases and acquired in-place leases is
recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Land improvements

25 to 40 years

Buildings and improvements

10 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Shorter of useful life or terms of related lease

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment

3 to 7 years

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on
hand and investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit of $100,000. The Company has not experienced any losses to date on its invested cash.

Cash Held in Escrows

Escrows include amounts established pursuant to various agreements for security deposits, property taxes, insurance and other costs.

Investment in Securities

The Company accounts for investments in trading securities at fair
value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. At December 31, 2007, investment in securities is comprised of an
investment in an unregistered money market fund. The investment was previously included in Cash and Cash Equivalents. In December 2007, the fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors may elect in-kind redemptions of the underlying
securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities mature or are liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, the Company expects to retain this investment for a longer term than originally
intended, and the valuation of the Company’s investment is subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund are now valued at less than their $1.00 par value, the Company has recognized a loss of approximately $0.3
million on its investment during the fourth quarter of 2007.

Tenant and other receivables

Tenant and other
accounts receivable, other than accrued rents receivable, are expected to be collected within one year.

Deferred Charges

Deferred charges include leasing costs and financing fees. Leasing costs include an allocation for acquired intangible in-place lease values and direct
and incremental fees and costs incurred in the successful negotiation of leases, including brokerage, legal, internal leasing employee salaries and other costs which have been deferred and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms
of the respective leases. Internal leasing salaries and related costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $4.1 million, $2.8



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

million and $2.0 million, respectively. External fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing have been deferred and are being amortized over the
terms of the respective loans on a basis that approximates the effective interest method and are included with interest expense. Unamortized financing and leasing costs are charged to expense upon the early repayment or significant modification of
the financing or upon the early termination of the lease, respectively. Fully amortized deferred charges are removed from the books upon the expiration of the lease or maturity of the debt.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities for which the
Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because it exercises significant influence over, but does not control, these entities. These investments are
recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the balance
sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, the net equity investment of the Company is
reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the Company’s share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different
percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, the Company’s recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture’s distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of
certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, the Company consolidates those in which it is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for
impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of the investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of
factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. The Company will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the value of an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary.

To the extent that the Company contributes assets to a joint venture, the
Company’s investment in the joint venture is recorded at the Company’s cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that the Company’s cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint
venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in the Company’s share of equity in net income of the joint venture. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 78-9
“Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures,” the Company will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner’s interest, to the extent the economic substance of
the transaction is a sale.

Equity Offering Costs

Underwriting commissions and offering costs have been
reflected as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.

Treasury Stock

The Company’s share
repurchases are reflected as treasury stock utilizing the cost method of accounting and are presented as a reduction to consolidated stockholders’ equity. The Company did not repurchase any of its shares during the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2006.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Dividends

Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to stockholders, will differ from income reported for
financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal income tax purposes in the treatment of gains on the sale of real property, revenue and expense recognition, compensation expense, and in the estimated useful lives used to compute
depreciation.

The tax treatment of common dividends per share
for federal income tax purposes is as follows:

(1)

Includes the special dividend of $5.98 per common share paid on January 30, 2008 of which approximately $3.10 per common share is allocable to 2007 and approximately $2.88 is
allocable to 2008.

(2)

Includes the special dividend of $5.40 per common share paid on January 30, 2007 of which approximately $3.44 per common share is allocable to 2006 and approximately $1.96 is
allocable to 2007.

(3)

Includes the special dividend of $2.50 per common share paid on October 31, 2005.

Revenue Recognition

Base rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. The impact of the straight-line rent adjustment
increased revenue by approximately $39.1 million, $53.7 million and $66.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, as the revenue recorded exceeded amounts billed. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, the
Company recognizes rental revenue of acquired in-place “above-” and “below-market” leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets,
represents rental income earned in excess of rent payments received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. The Company maintains an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential tenant credit losses. The credit
assessment is based on the estimated accrued rental income that is recoverable over the term of the lease. The Company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required
rent payments. The computation of this allowance is based on the tenants’ payment history and current credit status, as well as certain industry or geographic specific credit considerations. If the Company’s estimates of collectibility
differ from the cash received, then the timing and amount of the Company’s reported revenue could be impacted. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of the Company’s existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenant’s
risk profiles prior to lease execution and continual monitoring of the Company’s portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.

Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs are recognized
as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with EITF Issue 99-19 “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent” (“Issue 99-19”). Issue
99-19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as the Company is generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third- party suppliers, has discretion in selecting the supplier and has credit
risk. The Company also receives reimbursement of payroll and payroll related cost from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with Issue 99-19.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company’s hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to
guests for long-distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned.

The Company receives management and development fees from third parties. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a
percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. The Company reviews each development agreement and records development fees on a
straight-line basis or percentage of completion depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners’ ownership
interest.

Gains on sales of real estate are recognized
pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66 “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.” The specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing
involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, the Company defers gain recognition and accounts for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance,
installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.

Interest Expense and Interest Rate Protection Agreements

From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate protection agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt
or in anticipation of issuing fixed rate debt. The fair value of these agreements is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of these agreements would be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations if the
agreements were not effective for accounting purposes.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share
(“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders, as adjusted for unallocated earnings (if any) of certain securities issued by the Operating Partnership, by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans, including upon the exercise of stock options, and conversion of the minority interests in the
Operating Partnership.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
marketable securities, escrows, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments.

For purposes of disclosure, the Company calculates the fair value of mortgage
notes payable and unsecured senior notes. The Company discounts the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current
market rate, the Company adds its estimation of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to its debt. Because the Company’s valuations of its financial instruments are based on
these types of estimates, the fair value of its financial instruments may change if the Company’s estimates do not prove to be accurate. The fair value of the Company’s long-term indebtedness exceeds the aggregate carrying value by
approximately $59.7 million at December 31, 2007.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1997. As a result, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders. A REIT is subject
to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income. The Company’s policy is to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income. Accordingly,
the only provision for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the Company’s consolidated taxable REIT subsidiaries. The Company’s taxable REIT subsidiaries did not have significant tax
provisions or deferred income tax items.

In January 2002, the
Company formed a taxable REIT subsidiary, IXP, Inc. (IXP) which acts as a captive insurance company and is one of the elements of its overall insurance program. On September 27, 2006, IXP, Inc. was merged into IXP, LLC, a wholly owned
subsidiary, and all insurance policies issued by IXP, Inc. were cancelled and reissued by IXP, LLC. The accounts of IXP are consolidated within the Company. IXP, Inc. was a captive TRS that was subject to tax at the federal and state level.
Accordingly, the Company has recorded a tax provision in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Effective July 1, 2002, the Company restructured the leases with respect to its ownership of its hotel properties by
forming a taxable REIT subsidiary. The hotel taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is the lessee pursuant to leases for each of the hotel properties. As lessor, the Operating Partnership is entitled to a
percentage of gross receipts from the hotel properties. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel properties under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements. In connection with the restructuring, the
revenue and expenses of the hotel properties are being reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The hotel taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to tax at the federal and state level and, accordingly, the Company has
recorded a tax provision in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include such items as
depreciation and allowances for doubtful accounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Seven mortgage loans totaling approximately $357.6 million at December 31, 2007 and five mortgage loans totaling approximately $300.7 million at
December 31, 2006 have been accounted for at their fair values on the date the mortgage loans were assumed. The impact of recording the mortgage loans at fair value resulted in a decrease to interest expense of $4.2 million, $3.7 million and
$3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The cumulative liability related to the fair value adjustments was $17.6 million and $20.1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is
included in mortgage notes payable.

Unsecured Exchangeable Senior Notes

3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2036

On April 6, 2006, the Company’s Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.75%
exchangeable senior notes due 2036. On May 2, 2006, the Operating Partnership issued an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of the notes as a result of the exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option. The notes mature
on May 15, 2036, unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or redeemed.

Upon the occurrence of specified events, holders of the notes may exchange their notes prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 18, 2013 into cash and, at the
Operating Partnership’s option, shares of the Company’s common stock at an exchange rate of 10.0066 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or an exchange price of approximately $99.93 per share of common stock). The initial



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

exchange rate of 8.9461 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes and the initial exchange price of approximately $111.78 per share of the Company’s
common stock were adjusted to an exchange rate of 9.3900 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes and an exchange price of approximately $106.50 per share of common stock effective as of December 29, 2006 in connection with the special
dividend declared on December 15, 2006. The exchange rate and exchange price were further adjusted to the current exchange rate of 10.0066 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes and the current exchange price of approximately $99.93 per
share of common stock effective as of December 31, 2007 in connection with the special dividend declared on December 17, 2007. On and after May 18, 2013, the notes will be exchangeable at any time prior to the close of business on the
scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date at the option of the holder at the applicable exchange rate. The exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

Prior to May 18, 2013, the Operating Partnership may not redeem the
notes except to preserve the Company’s status as a REIT. On or after May 18, 2013, the Operating Partnership may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest. The Operating Partnership must make at least 12 semi-annual interest payments (including interest payments on November 15, 2006 and May 15, 2013) before redeeming any notes at the option of the Operating Partnership. Note
holders may require the Operating Partnership to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on May 18, 2013 and May 15 of 2016, 2021, 2026 and 2031 at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up
to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so repurchased.

If the Company undergoes a “fundamental change,” note holders will have the option to require the Operating Partnership to purchase all or any
portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all
notes so purchased. In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to May 18, 2013, the Operating Partnership will increase the exchange rate for a holder who elects to exchange its notes in connection with such a fundamental change under
certain circumstances. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership and will rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness of
the Operating Partnership. The notes will effectively rank junior in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership. The notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the subsidiaries of
the Operating Partnership.

2.875% Exchangeable Senior Notes
due 2037

On February 6, 2007, the Company’s
Operating Partnership completed an offering of $862.5 million in aggregate principal amount (including $112.5 million as a result of the exercise by the initial purchasers of their over-allotment option) of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due
2037. The notes were priced at 97.433333% of their face amount, resulting in an effective interest rate of approximately 3.438% per annum and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $840.0 million. The notes mature on February 15,
2037, unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or redeemed.

Upon
the occurrence of specified events, holders of the notes may exchange their notes prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding February 20, 2012 into cash and, at the Operating Partnership’s option,
shares of the Company’s common stock at an exchange rate of 7.0430 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or an exchange price of approximately $141.98 per share of the Company’s common stock). The initial exchange rate of 6.6090
shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes and the initial exchange price of approximately $151.31 per share of the Company’s common stock were adjusted to the current exchange rate and exchange price effective as of December 31, 2007 in
connection with the special dividend declared on

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

December 17, 2007. On and after February 20, 2012, the notes will be exchangeable at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled
trading day immediately preceding the maturity date at the option of the holder at the applicable exchange rate. The exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

Prior to February 20, 2012, the Operating Partnership may not redeem the notes except to preserve the Company’s
status as a REIT. On or after February 20, 2012, the Operating Partnership may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Note holders may require
the Operating Partnership to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on February 15 of 2012, 2017, 2022, 2027 and 2032 at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the
repurchase date. The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so repurchased.

If the Company undergoes a “fundamental change,” note holders will have the option to require the Operating Partnership to purchase all or any portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so purchased. In addition, if a fundamental change
occurs prior to February 20, 2012, the Operating Partnership will increase the exchange rate for a holder who elects to exchange its notes in connection with such a fundamental change under certain circumstances. The notes are senior unsecured
obligations of the Operating Partnership and will rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Operating Partnership. The notes will effectively
rank junior in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership. The notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.

In connection with the closing, the Company and the Operating Partnership
entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the initial purchasers, under which the Company and the Operating Partnership agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, to file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and maintain a shelf registration statement providing for the sale by the holders of the notes and the Company’s common stock, if any, issuable upon exchange of the notes. The Company and the Operating
Partnership will be required to pay liquidated damages in the form of specified additional interest to the holders of the notes if they fail to comply with these obligations; provided that the Operating Partnership will not be required to pay
liquidated damages with respect to any note after it has been exchanged for any of the Company’s common stock. On March 13, 2007, the Company and the Operating Partnership filed with the SEC a registration statement covering the resale of
the notes and shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of the notes. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on April 20, 2007.

9. Unsecured Line of Credit

On August 3, 2006, the Company modified its $605.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Unsecured Line of Credit”) by
extending the maturity date from October 30, 2007 to August 3, 2010, with a provision for a one-year extension at the option of the Company, subject to certain conditions, and by reducing the per annum variable interest rate on outstanding
balances from Eurodollar plus 0.65% to Eurodollar plus 0.55% per annum. The Unsecured Line of Credit is a recourse obligation of the Company’s Operating Partnership. Under the Unsecured Line of Credit, a facility fee equal to 15 basis
points per annum is payable in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in the Operating Partnership’s unsecured debt ratings. Effective March 22, 2007, the per annum
variable interest rate was reduced to Eurodollar plus 0.475% and the facility fee was reduced to 12.5 basis points per annum as a result of an increase in the Operating Partnership’s unsecured debt rating. The Unsecured Line of Credit involves
a syndicate of lenders. The Unsecured Line of Credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to the Company at a negotiated LIBOR-based rate. The Company had an outstanding balance on the
Unsecured Line of Credit of $225.0 million at December 31, 2006, which was collateralized by the Company’s 599 Lexington Avenue property and therefore was included in Mortgage Notes Payable in the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. On February 12, 2007, the Company repaid the $225.0 million draw that was collateralized by the Company’s 599 Lexington Avenue. As of December 31, 2007, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Unsecured Line of Credit.
The weighted-average balance outstanding was approximately $30.1 million and $240.4 million (including the $225.0 million collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue) during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
weighted-average interest rate on amounts outstanding was approximately 5.64% and 5.38% during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The terms of the Unsecured Line of Credit require that the Company maintain a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis,
including: (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however, the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%,
(3) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40, (4) an unsecured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however, the unsecured debt leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within
180 days, (5) a minimum net worth requirement, (6) an unsecured debt interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75 and (7) limitations on permitted investments, development, partially owned entities, business outside of commercial real
estate and commercial non-office properties. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company was in compliance with each of these financial and other covenant requirements.

10.

Commitments and Contingencies

General

In the normal course of business, the Company guarantees its performance of services or indemnifies third parties against its negligence.

The Company has letter of credit and performance obligations of approximately
$28.0 million related to lender and development requirements.

The Company and its third-party joint venture partners have guaranteed the seller financing totaling $7.5 million related to the acquisition of land by WP Project Developer LLC, the Land and Infrastructure Entity of the Wisconsin Place
joint venture entities. The seller financing was repaid on February 1, 2008.

Certain of the Company’s joint venture agreements include provisions whereby, at certain specified times, each partner has the right to initiate a purchase or sale of its interest in the joint ventures. Under
these provisions, the Company is not compelled to purchase the interest of its outside joint venture partners.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Management of the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of tenants and may require tenants to provide some form of credit support such as corporate
guarantees and/or other financial guarantees. Although the Company’s properties are geographically diverse and the tenants operate in a variety of industries, to the extent the Company has a significant concentration of rental revenue from any
single tenant, the inability of that tenant to make its lease payments could have an adverse effect on the Company.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.

The Company carries insurance coverage on its properties of types and in
amounts and with deductibles that it believes are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. In response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the
Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (as amended, “TRIA”) was enacted in November 2002 to require regulated insurers to make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the statute). The expiration date of TRIA was
extended to December 31, 2014 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (“TRIPRA”). Prior to TRIPRA, only acts of foreign terrorism could be “certified” for coverage under TRIA. Under TRIPRA, acts
of both foreign and domestic terrorism can be “certified” for coverage under TRIA. Currently, the Company’s property insurance program per occurrence limits are $900 million, including coverage for foreign acts of terrorism
“certified” under TRIA and coverage for domestic acts of terrorism up to $500 million per occurrence, and an additional $400 million of coverage for domestic acts of terrorism on a per occurrence and annual aggregate basis. Currently, the
Company also carries nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage (“NBCR Coverage”) for foreign acts of terrorism “certified” under TRIA, which is provided by IXP, LLC as a direct insurer, excluding
the Company’s Value-Added Fund properties. The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is $900 million. Under TRIA, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the NBCR Coverage is backstopped by the Federal Government if the
aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a “program trigger.” The program trigger is $100 million and the coinsurance is 10%. Under TRIPRA, if the Federal Government pays out for a loss
under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIPRA. The Company may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if
the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if there is a change in its portfolio or for any other reason. The Company intends to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain
insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable.

The Company also currently carries earthquake insurance on its properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes in an amount and subject to self-insurance that the Company believes are commercially reasonable. In addition,
this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. Specifically, the Company currently carries earthquake insurance which covers its San Francisco region with a $120 million per occurrence limit and
a $120 million annual aggregate limit, $20 million of which is provided by IXP, LLC, as a direct insurer. The amount of the Company’s earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, the amount
of earthquake coverage could impact the Company’s ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. The Company may discontinue earthquake insurance on some or all of its properties in the future if the premiums exceed the
Company’s estimation of the value of the coverage.

In
January 2002, the Company formed a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, IXP, Inc., to act as a captive insurance company and be one of the elements of the Company’s overall insurance program. On September 27, 2006, IXP, Inc. was merged
into IXP, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, and all insurance policies issued by IXP, Inc. were cancelled and reissued by IXP, LLC. The term “IXP” refers to IXP, Inc. for the period prior to September 27, 2006 and to IXP, LLC for the
period on and subsequent to September 27, 2006. IXP acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of the Company’s earthquake insurance coverage for its Greater San Francisco properties and the Company’s NBCR Coverage for foreign
acts of terrorism “certified” under TRIA. Insofar as the Company owns IXP, it is responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP are part of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In particular,
if a loss occurs which is covered by the Company’s NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government. IXP would also
be



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out under TRIA and if IXP maintains the NBCR policy after the
payout by the Federal Government. If the Company experiences a loss and IXP is required to pay under its insurance policy, the Company would ultimately record the loss to the extent of IXP’s required payment. Therefore, insurance coverage
provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance.

The Company continues to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism in particular,
but the Company cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars or the presence of mold at the Company’s properties, for which the
Company cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, if the Company experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy
limits, the Company could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that the Company could
be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition and results of operations.

Legal Matters

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in
the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. Management believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of
the Company.

State and Local Tax Matters

Because the Company is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally
not subject to federal income taxes, but is subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which the Company owns real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits.
Although the Company believes that it has substantial arguments in favor of its positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax
deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

Environmental Matters

It is the Company’s policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos
surveys in connection with the Company’s acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its business, assets,
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the Company is not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to its properties that the Company believes would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to
time environmental conditions at the Company’s properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action.

In February 1999, the Company (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was
formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. The Company developed an office park



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

on the property. The Company engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was
disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to the Company’s
ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify the Company for certain losses arising from preexisting site
conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.

Environmental investigations at some of the Company’s
properties and certain properties owned by affiliates of the Company have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case the Company engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary
investigations, and assessments and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a
status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. The Company also believes that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient
releases. Although the Company believes that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, the Company will take
necessary further response actions (if any are required). Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time.

Some of the Company’s properties and certain properties owned by the Company’s affiliates are located in urban,
industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or
include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these
situations it is the Company’s practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. The Company then uses this information as part of its
decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. For example, the Company owns a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility, which we may develop in the future.
Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory
submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that
mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable law.

The Company expects that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on
its business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, the Company cannot assure you that it has identified all environmental liabilities at its properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be
undertaken at the Company’s properties or that the Company will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.

Tax Protection Obligations

In connection with the acquisition or contribution of 24 properties, the Company entered into agreements for the benefit of
the selling or contributing parties which specifically state that until specified dates ranging from February 2008 to January 2009, or such time as the contributors do not hold at least a specified percentage of the OP Units owned by such person
following the contribution of the properties, the Operating Partnership will not sell or otherwise transfer the properties in a taxable transaction. If the Company does sell or transfer the properties in a taxable transaction, it would be liable to
the contributors for contractual damages.

11.

Minority Interests

Minority interests relate to the interest in the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company and interests in property partnerships not wholly-owned by
the Company. As of December 31, 2007, the minority interest in the Operating Partnership consisted of 20,271,341 OP Units, 676,067 LTIP Units and 1,113,044 Series Two Preferred Units (or 1,460,688 OP Units on an as converted basis) held by
parties other than the Company.

The minority interests in
property partnerships consist of the outside equity interests in ventures that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company because the Company exercises control over the entities that own the properties. The equity interests in these
ventures that are not owned by the Company, totaling approximately $25.8 million and $12.5 million at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, are included in Minority Interests on the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

On February 26, 2007, the Company entered into an
agreement to redeem the outside members’ equity interest in the limited liability company that owns 250 West 55th Street for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $23.4 million. The Company paid $17.0 million on February 26, 2007,
with $3.0 million paid on February 26, 2008 and the balance of approximately $3.4 million payable in monthly installments from March 1, 2007 through August 1, 2009. The redemption was accounted for using the purchase method in
accordance with SFAS No. 141 “Business Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141”). The difference between the aggregate book value of the outside members’ equity interest totaling approximately $10.6 million and the purchase
price increased the recorded value of the property’s net assets.

On May 31, 2007 and June 15, 2007, the Company paid an aggregate of $25.0 million in connection with the agreement entered into in May 2006 to redeem the outside members’ equity interests in the limited liability company that
owns Citigroup Center. The remaining unpaid redemption price, which is to be paid on May 31, 2008, is reflected at its fair value in Other Liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $24.4 million at
December 31, 2007.

During the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006, 606,186 and 1,982,105 Series Two Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership, respectively, were converted by the holders into 795,520 and 2,601,132 OP Units, respectively. In addition, the Company paid the accrued
preferred distributions due to the holders of Preferred Units that were converted.

During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, 1,342,226 and 3,161,265 OP Units, respectively, were presented by the holders for redemption and were redeemed by the Company in exchange for an equal number of
shares of Common Stock. The aggregate book value of the OP Units that were redeemed, as measured for each OP Unit on the date of its redemption, was approximately $30.6 million and $87.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The difference between the aggregate book value and the purchase price of these OP Units was approximately $112.7 million and $200.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which increased
the recorded value of the Company’s net assets.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Preferred Units at December 31, 2007 consist solely of 1,113,044 Series Two Preferred Units,
which bear a preferred distribution equal to the greater of (1) the distribution which would have been paid in respect of the Series Two Preferred Unit had such Series Two Preferred Unit been converted into an OP Unit (including both regular
and special distributions) or (2) an increasing rate, ranging from 5.00% to 7.00% per annum (7.00% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005) on a liquidation preference of $50.00 per unit, and are convertible into OP Units
at a rate of $38.10 per Preferred Unit (1.312336 OP Units for each Preferred Unit). Distributions to holders of Preferred Units are recognized on a straight-line basis that approximates the effective interest method.

On December 17, 2007, Boston Properties, Inc., as general partner of the
Operating Partnership, declared a special cash distribution on the OP Units and LTIP Units in the amount of $5.98 per unit which was paid on January 30, 2008 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2007. The
special cash distribution was in addition to the regular quarterly distributions of $0.68 per unit which were declared by Boston Properties, Inc., as general partner of the Operating Partnership, during the year ended December 31, 2007. Holders
of Series Two Preferred Units will participate in the $5.98 per unit special cash distribution on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2008 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership’s partnership
agreement. At December 31, 2007, the Company accrued approximately $8.7 million related to the $5.98 per unit special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred
Units of approximately $8.7 million, which amount has been reflected in Minority Interest in Operating Partnership within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2007.

On December 15, 2006, Boston Properties, Inc., as general partner of the
Operating Partnership, declared a special cash distribution on the OP Units and LTIP Units in the amount of $5.40 per unit which was paid on January 30, 2007 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on December 29, 2006. The
special cash distribution was in addition to the regular quarterly distributions of $0.68 per unit which were declared by Boston Properties, Inc., as general partner of the Operating Partnership, during the year ended December 31, 2006. Holders
of Series Two Preferred Units participated in the $5.40 per unit special cash distribution on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2007 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership’s partnership
agreement. At December 31, 2006, the Company accrued approximately $12.2 million related to the $5.40 per unit special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred
Units of approximately $12.2 million, which amount has been reflected in Minority Interest in Operating Partnership within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. During the year ended December 31,
2007, the Company recognized an adjustment of approximately $3.1 million to the special cash distribution accrual and allocation of earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units, as a result of conversions of Series Two Preferred Units, which amount
has been reflected in Minority Interest in Operating Partnership within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Series Two Preferred Units may be converted into OP Units at the election of the holder thereof at any time. A holder of an OP Unit may present such
OP Unit to the Operating Partnership for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such redemption right for a period of time, generally one year from
issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, the Operating Partnership must redeem such OP Unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of common stock of the Company. In lieu of a cash redemption, the Company may elect to acquire
such OP Unit for one share of Common Stock. The value of the OP Units (not owned by the Company and including LTIP Units assuming that all conditions have been met for the conversion thereof) and Series Two Preferred Units had such units been
redeemed at December 31, 2007 was approximately $1,923.2 million and $134.1 million, respectively, based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $91.81 per share.

Segment Reporting

The Company’s segments are based on the Company’s method of internal reporting which classifies its operations by both geographic area and
property type. The Company’s segments by geographic area are Greater Boston, Greater Washington, D.C., Midtown Manhattan, Greater San Francisco and New Jersey. Segments by property type include: Class A Office, Office/Technical and Hotels.

Asset information by segment is not reported because the
Company does not use this measure to assess performance. Therefore, depreciation and amortization expense is not allocated among segments. Interest and other income, development and management services, general and administrative expenses, interest
expense,

depreciation and amortization expense, losses from early extinguishments of debt, minority interests in property partnerships, income from unconsolidated
joint ventures, minority interest in Operating Partnership, gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate from discontinued
operations (net of minority interest) and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest) are not included in Net Operating Income as the internal reporting addresses these items on a corporate level.

Net Operating Income is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from
operating activities as measured by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and it is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of
liquidity. All companies may not calculate Net Operating Income in the same manner. The Company considers Net Operating Income to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the
core operations of the Company’s properties.

The following is a reconciliation of net operating income to net income available to common
shareholders (in thousands):

15.    Earnings
Per Share

Earnings per share (“EPS”) has been
computed pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 128. The following table provides a reconciliation of both the net income and the number of common shares used in the computation of basic EPS, which is calculated by dividing net income available
to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. During 2004, the Company adopted EITF 03-6 “Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB 128” (“EITF 03-6”),
which provides further guidance on the definition of participating securities. Pursuant to EITF 03-6, the Operating Partnership’s Series Two Preferred Units, which are reflected as Minority Interests in the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets, are considered participating securities and are included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share of the Company if the effect of applying the if-converted method is dilutive. The terms of the Series Two Preferred Units
enable the holders to obtain OP Units of the Operating Partnership, as well as Common Stock of the Company. Accordingly, for the reporting periods in which the Operating Partnership’s net income is in excess of distributions paid on the OP
Units, LTIP Units and Series Two Preferred Units, such income is allocated to the OP Units, LTIP Units and Series Two Preferred Units in proportion to their respective interests and the impact is included in the Company’s consolidated basic and
diluted earnings per share computation due to its holding of the Operating Partnership’s securities. For the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately $3.9 million was allocated to the Series Two Preferred Units in excess of
distributions paid during the reporting period and is included in the Company’s computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. There were no amounts required to be allocated to the Series Two Preferred Units for the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005. Other potentially dilutive common shares, including stock options, restricted stock and other securities of

16.    Employee Benefit Plans

Effective January 1, 1985, the predecessor of the Company adopted a
401(k) Savings Plan (the “Plan”) for its employees. Under the Plan, as amended, employees, as defined, are eligible to participate in the Plan after they have completed three months of service. Upon formation, the Company adopted the Plan
and the terms of the Plan.

Effective January 1, 2000, the
Company amended the Plan by increasing the Company’s matching contribution to 200% of the first 3% from 200% of the first 2% of participant’s eligible earnings contributed (utilizing earnings that are not in excess of an amount established
by the IRS ($220,000 in 2006 and $225,000 in 2007), indexed for inflation) and by eliminating the vesting requirement. The Company’s aggregate matching contribution for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $2.1 million,
$2.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively.

Effective
January 1, 2001, the Company amended the Plan to provide a supplemental retirement contribution to employees who have at least ten years of service on January 1, 2001, and who are 40 years of age or older as of January 1, 2001. The
maximum supplemental retirement contribution will not exceed the annual limit on contributions established by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company will record an annual supplemental retirement credit for the benefit of each participant. The
Company’s supplemental retirement contribution and credit for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $178,000, $191,000 and $189,000, respectively.

The Company also maintains a deferred compensation plan that is designed to allow officers of the Company to defer a portion of their
current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals. The Company’s obligation under the plan is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred compensation to the plan participants in the future. At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company has funded approximately $8.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively, into a separate account, which is not restricted as to its use. The Company’s liability under the plan is equal to the total
amount of compensation deferred by the plan participants and earnings on the deferred compensation pursuant to investments elected by the plan participants. The Company’s liability as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $8.3 million and $6.6
million, respectively, which are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

17.    Stock Option and Incentive Plan and Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has established a stock option and incentive plan for the purpose of attracting and retaining qualified employees and rewarding them for
superior performance in achieving the Company’s business goals and enhancing stockholder value.

At the Company’s 2007 annual meeting of stockholders held on May 15, 2007, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of
the Company’s 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) that, among other things, (1) increased the limit on full value shares (i.e., awards other than stock options) that may be issued under the Plan by 2,500,000 shares, (2)
extended the term of the Plan to May 15, 2017 and (3) added provisions that allow the Company to qualify certain grants under the Plan as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Under the amended plan, the number of shares of Common Stock available for
issuance is 4,019,174 shares. At December 31, 2007, the number of shares available for issuance under the plan was 3,876,184, of which a maximum of 3,423,348 shares may be granted as awards other than stock options.

Options granted under the plan became exercisable over a two-, three- or
five-year period and have terms of ten years, as determined at the time of the grant. All options were granted at the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock at the dates of grant. As of January 17, 2005, all outstanding options
had become fully vested and exercisable.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company issued 6,536, 9,182 and 12,317 shares of restricted stock and 156,161, 147,845 and
211,408 LTIP Units under the plan during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The shares of restricted stock were valued at approximately $0.8 million ($125.46 per share weighted-average), $0.8 million ($89.03 per
share weighted-average) and $0.7 million ($57.99 per share weighted-average) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. LTIP Units were valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123R. LTIP Units issued during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were valued at approximately $18.0 million, $11.2 million and $10.5 million, respectively. The weighted-average per unit fair value of LTIP Unit grants in
2007, 2006 and 2005 was $115.47, $75.64 and $49.59, respectively. The per unit fair value of each LTIP Unit granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions; an expected life of 5.3 years, 6.5 years
and 8 years, a risk-free interest rate of 4.82%, 4.97% and 3.96% and an expected price volatility of 18.00%, 17.84% and 20.00%, respectively. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of restricted stock in the Company. The
aggregate value of the LTIP Units is included in Minority Interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restricted stock and LTIP Units granted to employees between January 1, 2005 and November 21, 2006 vest over a five-year term.
Grants of restricted stock and LTIP Units made on and after November 22, 2006 vest in four equal annual installments. Restricted stock and LTIP Units are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares or units
granted, as adjusted for forfeitures and the price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period.
Dividends paid on both vested and unvested shares of restricted stock are charged directly to Earnings in Excess of Dividends in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock and LTIP Units was
approximately $11.4 million, $7.7 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, in accordance with the modified prospective application transition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, the
Company has recognized compensation expense of approximately $50,000 relating to its unvested stock options for the year ended December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2007, there was $25.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
unvested restricted stock and LTIP Units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.7 years.

In connection with the declaration of the special cash dividends of $5.98 per share of Common Stock paid on January 30, 2008 to shareholders of
record on December 31, 2007, $5.40 per share of Common Stock paid on January 30, 2007 to shareholders of record on December 29, 2006 and $2.50 per share of Common Stock paid on October 31, 2005 to shareholders of record on
September 30, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors approved adjustments to all its outstanding stock option awards that were intended to ensure that its employees, directors and other persons who held such stock options were not
disadvantaged by the special cash dividend. The exercise prices and number of all outstanding options were adjusted as of the close of business on the last trading day prior to the related “ex-dividend” date such that each option had the
same fair value to the holder before and after giving effect to the payment of the special cash dividend. Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, no compensation cost has been recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations in connection with such adjustments. As a result, effective as of the close of business on December 26, 2007, 2,131,556 outstanding stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $37.42 were adjusted to 2,264,535 outstanding
options with a weighted-average exercise price of $35.22, and effective as of the close of business on December 26, 2006, 2,655,275 outstanding stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $39.37 were adjusted to 2,788,634
outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $37.49, and effective as of the close of business on September 27, 2005, 4,325,656 outstanding stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $38.96 were adjusted to
4,481,864 outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $37.61. There were no other adjustments to the terms of the outstanding stock option awards.

The Company
adopted the 1999 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Stock Purchase Plan”) to encourage the ownership of Common Stock by eligible employees. The Stock Purchase Plan became effective on January 1, 1999 with an aggregate
maximum of 250,000 shares of Common Stock available for issuance. The Stock Purchase Plan provides for eligible employees to purchase on the business day immediately following the end of the biannual purchase periods (i.e.,
January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31) shares of Common Stock at a purchase price equal to 85% of the average closing prices of the Common Stock during the last ten business days of the purchase period. The Company issued
6,166, 7,633 and 7,492 shares with the weighted average purchase price equal to $90.98 per share, $69.02 per share and $56.56 per share under the Stock Purchase Plan during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

18.    Selected Interim Financial Information (unaudited)

The tables below reflect the Company’s selected quarterly information
for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Total revenue and income before minority interest in Operating Partnership amounts have been reclassified for properties qualifying for discontinued operations presentation under SFAS
No. 144.

19.    Held for
Sale/Discontinued Operations

The Company applies the
provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lesser of (1) book value or
(2) fair value less cost to sell. In addition, it requires that one accounting model be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions.

On November 27, 2007, the Company acquired Mountain View
Research Park for $183.0 million and Mountain View Technology Park for $40.0 million (See Note 3). On January 7, 2008, the Company transferred the properties to its Value-Added Fund for an aggregate of approximately $223.2 million (See Note
22). At December 31, 2007, the Company had categorized Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park as “Held for Sale” in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the Company’s continuing involvement through its
ownership interest in the Value-Added Fund, these properties have not been categorized as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company sold the following operating properties:

•

Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E, comprised of three Class A office properties aggregating approximately 337,000 net rentable

Times Square as “held for sale” in its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006).

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company sold 280 Park Avenue, a Class A office property totaling approximately 1,179,000 net
rentable square feet located in midtown Manhattan.

During the
year ended December 31, 2005, the Company sold the following operating properties:

•

Old Federal Reserve, a Class A office property totaling approximately 150,000 net rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California;

Embarcadero Center West Tower, a Class A office property totaling approximately 475,000 net rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California.

Due to the Company’s continuing
involvement in the management, for a fee, of 280 Park Avenue and 5 Times Square through agreements with the buyers and other financial obligations to the buyers as discussed in Note 3, 280 Park Avenue and 5 Times Square have not been categorized as
discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Due to the Company’s continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of the Democracy Center, 100 East Pratt Street, Riverfront Plaza and Embarcadero Center
West Tower properties through agreements with the buyers which were entered into at closing, these properties are not categorized as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result, the gains on sales
related to these properties have been reflected under the caption “Gains on sales of real estate and other assets, net of minority interest,” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has presented the other properties
listed above as discontinued operations in its Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, as applicable.

The Company’s
application of SFAS No. 144 results in the presentation of the net operating results of these qualifying properties sold or designated as “held for sale” during 2007, 2006 and 2005, as income from discontinued operations for all
periods presented. In addition, SFAS No. 144 results in the gains on sale of these qualifying properties totaling approximately $220.3 million (net of minority interest share of $39.2 million) and $47.7 million (net of minority interest share
of $9.4 million) to be reflected as gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2005, respectively. The application of SFAS
No. 144 does not have an impact on net income available to common shareholders. SFAS No. 144 only impacts the presentation of these properties within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

20.    Newly Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN No. 48”). FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on description,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN No. 48, which was adopted by the Company effective
January 1, 2007, did not have a material impact on the Company’s cash flows, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS
No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date
of SFAS No. 157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The FASB also removed certain leasing transactions from the
scope of SFAS No. 157. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on the Company’s cash flows, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure many financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on the Company’s cash flows, results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.

In December 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” ("SFAS No. 141(R)"), which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer shall recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of
the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on its financial position and results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an Amendment of ARB No. 51” (“SFAS No. 160”), which establishes and expands accounting and reporting standards for minority interests, which will be
recharacterized as noncontrolling interests, in a subsidiary and the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting
period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have
on its financial position and results of operations.

21.    Related Party Transactions

The Company paid Applied Printing Technologies, a printing company affiliated with Mr. Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, approximately $0, $0 and $67,000 during the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for printing services principally relating to the printing of the Company’s annual report to shareholders.

An entity controlled by Mr. Zuckerman owned an office building located at 2400 N Street, N.W. in Washington, D.C., in
which a company affiliated with Mr. Zuckerman leased 100% of the building. The Company had entered into an agreement with an entity controlled by Mr. Zuckerman to manage this property on terms comparable with other third-party property
management agreements that the Company had in place. The disinterested members of the Company’s Board of Directors had approved the management agreement between the Company and Mr. Zuckerman’s affiliate. Under the management
agreement, the Company had also agreed to provide consulting services and assistance in connection with a possible sale of this property in exchange for a fee of $100,000 payable upon the closing of the sale of the property. During the year ended
December 31, 2005, the Company received approximately $329,000 for reimbursements of building operating costs and earned $66,000 in management fees under the management agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the entity
controlled by Mr. Zuckerman closed on the sale of the property and pursuant to the management agreement the Company received and recognized $100,000 for consulting services and assistance in connection with the sale.

On October 26, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with an entity owned
by Mr. Zuckerman. Under the agreement, which was approved by the disinterested members of the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company renders project management services to such entity in exchange for a fee. The Company extended its
services under a letter dated October 10, 2006. Under the agreement, as extended, the Company earned $80,000, $57,000 and $0 during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

A firm controlled by Mr. Raymond A. Ritchey’s brother was paid
aggregate leasing commissions of approximately $848,000, $559,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to certain exclusive leasing arrangements for certain Northern Virginia properties.
Mr. Ritchey is an Executive Vice President of Boston Properties, Inc.

Mr. Martin Turchin, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, is a non-executive/non-director Vice Chairman of CB Richard Ellis (“CBRE”). Through an arrangement with CBRE and its predecessor,
Insignia/ESG, Inc. that has been in place since 1985, Mr. Turchin and Turchin & Associates, an entity owned by Mr. Turchin (95%) and his son (5%), participate in brokerage activities for which CBRE is retained as leasing
agent, some of which involve leases for space within buildings owned by the Company. Additionally, Mr. Turchin’s son is employed by CBRE and works on transactions for which CBRE earns commission income from the Company.
Mr. Turchin’s son’s compensation from CBRE is in the form of salary and bonus, neither of which is directly tied to CBRE’s transactions with the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
Mr. Turchin, directly and through Turchin & Associates, received commission income of $95,000, $19,000 and $194,000, respectively, from commissions earned by CBRE and its predecessor, Insignia/ESG, Inc., from the Company. Pursuant to
its arrangement with CBRE, Turchin & Associates has confirmed to the Company that it is paid on the same basis with respect to properties owned by the Company as it is with respect to properties owned by other clients of CBRE.
Mr. Turchin does not participate in any discussions or other activities relating to the Company’s contractual arrangements with CBRE either in his capacity as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors or as a Vice Chairman of CBRE.

On June 30, 1998, the Company acquired from entities
controlled by Mr. Alan B. Landis, a former director, a portfolio of properties known as the Carnegie Center Portfolio and Tower Center One and related operations and development rights (collectively, the “Carnegie Center
Portfolio”). In connection with the acquisition of the Carnegie Center Portfolio, the Operating Partnership entered into a development agreement (the “Development Agreement”) with affiliates of Mr. Landis providing for up to
approximately 2,000,000 square feet of development in or adjacent to the Carnegie Center office complex. An affiliate of Mr. Landis was entitled to a purchase price for each parcel developed under the Development Agreement calculated on the
basis of $20 per rentable square foot of property developed. Another affiliate of Mr. Landis was eligible to earn a contingent payment for each developed property that achieves a stabilized return in excess of a target annual return ranging
between 10.5% and 11%. The Development Agreement also provided that upon negotiated terms and conditions, the Company and Mr. Landis would form a development company to provide development services for these development projects and would share
the expenses and profits, if any, of this new company. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of the Carnegie Center Portfolio, Mr. Landis became a director of the Company pursuant to an Agreement Regarding Directorship, dated as of
June 30, 1998, with the Company (the “Directorship Agreement”). Under the Directorship Agreement, the Company agreed to nominate Mr. Landis for re-election as a director at each annual meeting of stockholders of the Company in a
year in which his term expires, provided that specified conditions are met.

On October 21, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement (the “2004 Agreement”) to modify several provisions of the Development Agreement. Under the terms of the 2004 Agreement, the Operating
Partnership and affiliates of Mr. Landis amended the Development Agreement to limit the rights of Mr. Landis and his



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

affiliates to participate in the development of properties under the Development Agreement. Among other things, Mr. Landis agreed that
(1) Mr. Landis and his affiliates will have no right to participate in any entity formed to acquire land parcels or the development company formed by the Operating Partnership to provide development services under the Development
Agreement, (2) Mr. Landis will have no right or obligation to play a role in development activities engaged in by the development company formed by the Operating Partnership under the Development Agreement or receive compensation from the
development company and (3) the affiliate of Mr. Landis will have no right to receive a contingent payment for developed properties based on stabilized returns. In exchange, the Company (together with the Operating Partnership) agreed to:

•

effective as of June 30, 1998, pay Mr. Landis $125,000 on January 1 of each year until the earlier of (A) January 1, 2018, (B) the
termination of the Development Agreement or (C) the date on which all development properties under the Development Agreement have been conveyed pursuant to the Development Agreement, with $750,000, representing payments of this annual amount
from 1998 to 2004, being paid upon execution of the 2004 Agreement; and

•

pay an affiliate of Mr. Landis, in connection with the development of land parcels acquired under the Development Agreement, an aggregate fixed amount of
$10.50 per rentable square foot of property developed (with a portion of this amount (i.e., $5.50) being subject to adjustment, in specified circumstances, based on future increases in the Consumer Price Index) in lieu of a contingent payment based
on stabilized returns, which payment could have been greater or less than $10.50 per rentable square foot of property developed.

The Operating Partnership also continues to be obligated to pay an affiliate of Mr. Landis the purchase price of $20 per rentable square foot of
property developed for each land parcel acquired as provided in the original Development Agreement. During the 20-year term of the Development Agreement, until such time, if any, as the Operating Partnership elects to acquire a land parcel, an
affiliate of Mr. Landis will remain responsible for all carrying costs associated with such land parcel. On July 24, 2007, the Company acquired from Mr. Landis 701 Carnegie Center, a land parcel located in Princeton, New Jersey for a
purchase price of approximately $3.1 million with the title transferring pending subdivision approval.

In addition, in connection with entering into the 2004 Agreement, Mr. Landis resigned as a director of the Company effective as of May 11, 2005
and agreed that the Company had no future obligation to nominate Mr. Landis as a director of the Company under the Directorship Agreement or otherwise. Mr. Landis did not resign because of a disagreement with the Company on any matter
relating to its operations, policies or practices. Mitchell S. Landis, the Senior Vice President and Regional Manager of the Company’s Princeton, New Jersey region, is the brother of Alan B. Landis.

In accordance with the Company’s 1997 Plan, and as approved by the Board
of Directors, each non-employee director has made an election to receive deferred stock units in lieu of cash fees. The deferred stock units will be settled in shares of common stock upon the cessation of such director’s service on the Board of
Directors. As a result of these elections, the aggregate cash fees otherwise payable to a non-employee director during a fiscal quarter are converted into a number of deferred stock units equal to the aggregate cash fees divided by the last reported
sales price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the last trading of the applicable fiscal quarter. The deferred stock units are also credited with dividend equivalents. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had outstanding
59,015 and 54,157 deferred stock units, respectively, with an aggregate value of approximately $3.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, which amounts are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

22.    Subsequent Events

On January 7, 2008, the Company transferred its Mountain View, California properties to its Value-Added Fund for an
aggregate of approximately $223.2 million, consisting of approximately $100.2 million of cash and a promissory note having a principal amount of $123.0 million. The note bears interest at a rate of 7% per annum and matures in April 2008,
subject to extension at the option of the Value-Added Fund (with the Company’s approval) until April 2009. In connection with the transfer of the Research Park and Technology Park properties to the Value-Added Fund, the Company and its partners
agreed to certain modifications to the Value-Added Fund’s original terms, including bifurcating the Value-Added Fund’s promote structure such that Research Park and Technology Park will be accounted for separately from the non-Mountain
View properties owned by the Value-Added Fund (i.e., Circle Star and 300 Billerica Road). As a result of the modifications, the Company’s interest in the Mountain View properties is approximately 39.5% and its interest in the non-Mountain View
properties is 25%. This investment completes the investment commitments from the Value-Added Fund partners.

On January 24, 2008, the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company approved
outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to officers and key employees of the Company. These awards (the “2008 OPP Awards”) are part of a new broad-based, long-term incentive compensation program designed to provide the Company’s
management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to the Company “outperforming” and creating shareholder value in a pay-for-performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilize total
return to shareholders (“TRS”) over a three-year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time-based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a
retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if the Company’s TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three-year measurement period from
February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of the Company’s common stock (a “REIT Share”) of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February 5, 2008. The
aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million have been
allocated and will be granted on February 5, 2008. The balance remains available for future grants, with OPP awards exceeding a potential reward of $1 million requiring the Committee’s approval.

The outperformance pool will consist of (i) three percent (3%) of
the excess total return above a cumulative absolute TRS hurdle of 30% over the full three-year measurement period (the “Absolute TRS Component”) and (ii) three percent (3%) of the excess or deficient excess total return above or
below a relative TRS hurdle equal to the total return of the SNL Equity REIT Index over the three-year measurement period (the “Relative TRS Component”). In the event that the Relative TRS Component is potentially positive because the
Company’s TRS is higher than the total return of the SNL Equity REIT Index, but the Company achieves a cumulative absolute TRS below 30% over the three-year measurement period (equivalent to 10% per annum), the actual contribution to the
outperformance pool from the Relative TRS Component will be subject to a sliding scale factor as follows: (i) 100% of the potential Relative TRS Component will be earned if the Company’s TRS is equal to or greater than a cumulative 30%
over three years (equivalent to 10% per annum), (ii) 0% will be earned if the Company’s TRS is equal to or less than a cumulative 21% over three years (equivalent to 7% per annum), and (iii) a percentage from 0% to 100%
calculated by linear interpolation will be earned if the Company’s cumulative TRS over three years is between 21% and 30%. The potential Relative TRS Component before application of the sliding scale factor will be capped at $110 million (or
such lesser amount as corresponds to the OPP awards actually granted). In the event that the Relative TRS Component is negative because the Company’s TRS is less than the total return of the SNL Equity REIT Index, any outperformance reward
potentially earned under the Absolute TRS Component will be reduced dollar for dollar, provided that the potential Absolute TRS Component



BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

before reduction for any negative Relative TRS Component will be capped at $110 million (or such lesser amount as corresponds to the OPP awards actually
granted). The algebraic sum of the Absolute TRS Component and the Relative TRS Component determined as described above will never exceed $110 million (or such lesser amount as corresponds to the OPP awards actually granted).

Each employee’s 2008 OPP Award will be designated as a specified
percentage of the aggregate outperformance pool. Assuming the applicable absolute and/or relative TRS thresholds are achieved at the end of the measurement period, the algebraic sum of the Absolute TRS Component and the Relative TRS Component will
be calculated and then allocated among the 2008 OPP Award recipients in accordance with each individual’s percentage. Rewards earned with respect to 2008 OPP Awards will vest 25% on February 5, 2011, 25% on February 5, 2012, and 50%
on February 5, 2013, based on continued employment. Vesting will be accelerated in the event of a change of control of the Company, termination of employment by the Company without cause, termination of employment by the award recipient for
good reason, death, disability or retirement, although restrictions on transfer will continue to apply in certain of these situations. 2008 OPP Awards will be in the form of LTIP units of limited partnership interest of the Operating Partnership.
LTIP Units were issued prior to the determination of the outperformance pool, but will remain subject to forfeiture depending on the extent of rewards earned with respect to 2008 OPP Awards. The number of LTIP Units issued initially to recipients of
the 2008 OPP Awards was an estimate of the maximum number of LTIP Units that they could earn, based on certain assumptions. The number of LTIP Units actually earned by each award recipient will be determined at the end of the performance measurement
period by dividing his or her share of the outperformance pool by the average closing price of a REIT Share for the 15 trading days immediately preceding the measurement date. Total return for the Company and for the SNL Equity REIT Index over the
three-year measurement period and other circumstances will determine how many LTIP Units are earned by each recipient; if they are fewer than the number issued initially, the balance will be forfeited as of the performance measurement date. Prior to
the measurement date, LTIP units issued on account of 2008 OPP Awards will be entitled to receive per unit distributions equal to one-tenth (10%) of the regular quarterly distributions payable on a common unit of limited partnership interest in
the Operating Partnership, but will not be entitled to receive any special distributions. After the measurement date, the number of LTIP Units, both vested and unvested, which 2008 OPP Award recipients have earned based on the establishment of an
outperformance pool, will be entitled to receive distributions in an amount per unit equal to distributions, both regular and special, payable on a Common Unit.

On January 29, 2008, the Wisconsin Place joint venture entity that owns and is developing the office component of the project (the “Office
Entity”) (a joint venture entity in which the Company owns a 66.67% interest) obtained construction financing totaling $115.0 million collateralized by the office property. Wisconsin Place is a mixed-use development project consisting of
office, retail and residential properties located in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum and matures on January 29, 2011 with two, one-year extension
options. On January 29, 2008, the Wisconsin Place joint venture entity that owns and is developing the land and infrastructure components of the project (the “Land and Infrastructure Entity”) (a joint venture entity in which the
Company owns an effective interest of approximately 23.89%) executed a second amendment to its construction loan agreement. The construction financing consisted of a $69.1 million commitment, bearing interest at a per annum variable rate equal to
LIBOR plus 1.50% and maturing on March 11, 2009. The outstanding balance on the construction loan was approximately $52.6 million on the $69.1 million commitment. The amended agreement provides for a reduction in the loan commitment amount to
$36.9 million. The reduction relates to the repayment of the office portion of the outstanding balance totaling approximately $24.9 million and an additional reduction in the borrowing capacity of approximately $7.3 million with a corresponding
release of collateral in conjunction with the Office Entity obtaining new construction financing.

On February 1, 2008, the Company used available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized
by its Reston Corporate Center property located in Reston, Virginia totaling approximately $20.5 million. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. The mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.56% per annum and was
scheduled to mature on May 1, 2008.

On February 5,
2008, the Company executed a 60-year ground lease with The George Washington University for the redevelopment of a site at Pennsylvania Avenue and Washington Circle in the District of Columbia as a mixed-use project comprised of
approximately 440,000 gross square feet of office, 84,000 gross square feet of retail and 328,000 gross square feet of residential space.
