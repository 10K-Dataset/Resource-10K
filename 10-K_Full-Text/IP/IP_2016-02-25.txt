INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY

INDEX TO ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2015


PART I.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

International Paper Company (the “Company” or “International Paper,” which may also be referred to as “we” or “us”) is a global paper and packaging company with primary markets and manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Russia, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We are a New York corporation, incorporated in 1941 as the successor to the New York corporation of the same name organized in 1898. Our home page on the Internet is www.internationalpaper.com. You can learn more about us by visiting that site.

In the United States, at

December 31, 2015

, the Company operated


pulp, paper and packaging mills,


converting and packaging plants,


recycling plants and

three

bag facilities. Production facilities at

December 31, 2015

in Europe, Asia, Africa, India, Latin America and South America included


pulp, paper and packaging mills,


converting and packaging plants, and

two

recycling plants.  We operate a printing and packaging products distribution business principally through 12 branches in Asia.  At

December 31, 2015

, we owned or managed approximately

335,000

acres of forestland in Brazil and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government-owned forestlands in Russia. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions.

For management and financial reporting purposes, our businesses are separated into three segments: Industrial Packaging; Printing Papers; and Consumer Packaging. A description of these business segments can be found on pages 24 and 25 of

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

. The Company’s

50%

equity interest in Ilim Holding S.A. is also a separate reportable industry segment.

From 2011 through 2015, International Paper’s capital expenditures approximated

$6.6 billion

, excluding mergers and acquisitions. These expenditures reflect our continuing efforts to improve product quality and environmental performance, as well as lower costs and maintain reliability of operations. Capital spending in


was approximately

$1.5 billion

and is expected to be approximately

$1.3 billion

COMPETITION AND COSTS

The markets in the pulp, paper and packaging product lines are large and fragmented. The major markets, both U.S. and non-U.S., in which the Company sells its principal products are very competitive. Our products compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies. We also compete, in some instances, with companies in other industries and against substitutes for wood-fiber products.

Many factors influence the Company’s competitive position, including price, cost, product quality and services. You can find more information about the impact of these factors on operating profits on pages 17 through 30 of

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Company operates its primary research and development center in Loveland, Ohio, as well as several product laboratories. Additionally, the Company has an interest in ArborGen, Inc., a joint venture with certain other forest products companies.

We direct research and development activities to short-term, long-term and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions, and to process, equipment and product innovations. Activities include product development within the operating divisions; studies on innovation and improvement of pulping, bleaching, chemical recovery, papermaking, converting and coating processes; packaging design and materials development; mechanical packaging systems, environmentally sensitive printing inks and reduction of environmental discharges; re-use of raw materials in manufacturing processes; recycling of consumer and packaging paper products; energy conservation; applications of computer controls to manufacturing operations; innovations and improvement of products; and development of various new products. Our development efforts specifically address product safety as well as the minimization of solid waste. The cost to the Company of its research and development operations was

$27 million

in


,

$16 million

in


and

$18 million

in


.

We own numerous patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights relating to our products and to the processes for their production. We also license intellectual property rights to and from others where advantageous or necessary. Many of the manufacturing processes are among our trade secrets. Some of our products are covered by U.S. and non-U.S. patents and are sold under well known trademarks. We derive a competitive advantage by protecting our trade secrets, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and by using them as required to support our businesses.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

International Paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally. Our continuing objectives include: (1) controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air, water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment, and (2) maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company spent $93 million in 2015 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water, and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste.  The 2015 spend included

costs associated with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Boiler MACT (maximum achievable control technology)

regulations. We expect

to spend $118 million in 2016 for similar capital projects. Capital expenditures for 2017 environmental projects are anticipated to be approximately $114 million.  Capital expenditures for 2018 environmental projects are estimated to be $83 million.  On January 31, 2013, EPA issued the final suite of Boiler MACT regulations. These regulations require owners of specified boilers to meet revised air emissions standards for certain substances. Several lawsuits have been filed to challenge all or portions of the Boiler MACT regulations.  On December 3, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments of the petitioners challenging these regulations.  As such, the projected capital expenditures for environmental projects represent our current best estimate of future expenditures with the recognition that the Boiler MACT regulations could change as a result of the pending court decision.

In the U.S., revisions to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and fine particulate (PM2.5) finalized between 2010 and 2012, and a promulgated revision to the NAAQS for ozone on October 1, 2015, have not had a material impact on the Company. Similarly, regulations addressing specific implementation issues related to the SO2 NAAQS were released in 2015 by the EPA and are being implemented during the next two to four years. Potentially material capital investment may be required in response to these emerging requirements, but evaluations are ongoing.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Climate change refers to any significant change in the measure of the earth’s climatic conditions such as temperature, precipitation, or winds that persist for decades or longer. Climate change can be caused by natural factors, such as changes in the sun’s intensity and ocean circulation, and human activities can also affect the composition of the earth’s atmosphere, such as from the burning of fossil fuels. In an effort to mitigate the potential of climate change impacts from human activities, various international, national and sub-national (regional, state and local) governmental actions have been undertaken. Presently, these efforts have not materially impacted International Paper, but such efforts may have a material impact on the Company in the future.

International Efforts

The 1997 Kyoto Protocol established emission reduction obligations for certain countries where the Company had and continues to have operations. Though the Kyoto Protocol expired in 2012, several countries, and most notably the European Union (EU), extended their emissions commitments until 2020. A successor program to the Kyoto Protocol is the subject



of on-going international negotiations including a Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the Kyoto Protocol. COP21 took place in December 2015 and although well short of reaching another international agreement, many countries, including the U.S. and EU member states, did establish non-binding emissions reduction targets. The U.S non-binding commitment is for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to be 26% to 28% below 2005 GHG emissions levels by 2025. Other countries in which we do business made similar non-binding commitments. The Company’s voluntary GHG reductions, which are set out in the Company’s annual Sustainability Report, are roughly in line with the percentages of the U.S. non-binding commitment. It is not clear at this time what, if any, further reductions by the Company might be required by the countries in which we operate. Due to this uncertainty, it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of future international agreements on the Company.

To assist member countries in meeting obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU established and continues to operate an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Currently, we have two sites directly subject to regulation under Phase III of the EU ETS, one in Poland and one in France. Other sites that we operate in the EU experience indirect impacts of the EU ETS through purchased power pricing. Neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the EU ETS have been material to the Company, but they could be material to the Company in the future depending on how the 2015 non-binding commitments or allocation of and market prices for GHG credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years.

National Efforts

In the U.S., the Kyoto Protocol was not ratified and Congress has not passed GHG legislation. EPA has enacted (i) regulations to control GHGs from mobile sources (through transportation fuel efficiency standards), (ii) New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new Electrica Generating Units (EGUs), (iii) regulations requiring reporting of GHGs from sources of GHGs greater than 25,000 tons per year, and (iv) in 2015, requirements for states to develop plans to reduce GHGs from utility electric generating units (EGUs). In 2015, the Company reported to EPA the GHG emissions from 21 of our U.S. manufacturing sites and 9 landfills.

On November 19, 2014, EPA issued a revised draft carbon accounting framework addressing the circumstances under which biomass combustion can be considered carbon neutral. EPA has stated it intends to issue future rulemakings to address how states may use the revised framework in implementing state permit rules and in developing plans for regulating GHGs from utility electric generators. Given the uncertainties

regarding the framework and scope of future GHG rulemaking, it is unclear what impacts, if any, EPA’s actions in this area will have on the Company’s operations. To date there have been only minor permitting considerations and no substantive impacts.

In 2013, EPA issued final regulations establishing NSPS for new (EGUs). This regulation is the first of several expected NSPSs that EPA will implement over the coming years. The EPA has not yet identified the pulp and paper industry in the first phase of sectors to be covered by the new standards. However, we anticipate that at some future time pulp and paper sources may be subject to new GHG NSPS rules. It is unclear what impacts, if any, future GHG NSPS rules will have on the Company’s operations.

On August 3, 2015, EPA promulgated the Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule to address climate change by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) and other designated green house gas pollutant emissions from utility EGUs. In response, states are to develop EGU pollutant reduction plans over the next 1 to 3 years to reduce emissions over the 2022 to 2033 timeframe by about 32 percent from 2005 levels.  These plans, or the federal plan that would take effect if the states do not act, pose potential cost increases for electricity purchased by the Company. EPA estimated that the proposed rule would increase purchased electricity prices by less than seven percent, but some utilities are estimating significantly higher price increases from the final rule (11 to 14%, or more). The magnitude of the cost increase to the Company will not be possible to estimate reliably until the plans and the utility industries’ responses are better defined over the next few years. Adding to the uncertainty, states and some industry parties have filed lawsuits challenging the rule, the result of which could materially affect the scope and stringency of the regulations. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the Clean Power Plan.  The stay will remain in effect until final disposition of the case, and as such, the rule’s potential impact on the Company remains unclear.

State, Regional and Local Measures

A few U.S. states have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of GHGs by companies and public utilities, primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. One such state is California. The Company does not have any sites currently subject to California's GHG regulatory plan. There may be indirect impacts from changing input costs (such as electricity) at some of our California converting operations but these have yet to manifest themselves in material impacts. Although we are monitoring proposed programs in other states, it is unclear what impacts, if any, state-level GHG rules will



have on the Company’s operations.  Further state measures are under substantive review as they respond to EPA’s 2015 Clean Power Plan and develop an implementation plan over the next 1 to 3 years. The CPP allows significant flexibility in how states develop their plans, so the uncertainty regarding potential impacts will remain high until more specificity is reached and individual power companies develop their compliance strategies.

Summary

Regulation of GHGs continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business. While it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding GHGs and climate change, any material impact to the company is not likely to occur before 2020 and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate Company costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future.  In addition to possible direct impacts, future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on International Paper, such as higher prices for transportation, energy and other inputs, as well as more protracted air permitting processes, causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects. International Paper has controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the U.S. and in other countries where we operate. We regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the Company, its operations or financial condition, and whether we have any related disclosure obligations.

Additional information regarding climate change and International Paper is available in our Sustainability Report found at

, though this information is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the SEC.

EMPLOYEES

As of

December 31, 2015

, we have approximately

56,000

employees, nearly

34,000

of whom are located in the United States. Of the U.S. employees, approximately

26,000

are hourly, with unions representing approximately

14,000

employees. Approximately

11,000

of this number are represented by the United Steelworkers union (USW).

International Paper, the USW, and several other unions have entered into two master agreements covering various mills and converting facilities.  These master agreements cover several specific items, including

wages, select benefit programs, successorship, employment security, and health and safety.  Individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other subjects not covered by the master agreements.  If local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration, under the terms of the master agreements the local contracts will automatically renew with the same terms in effect.  The mill master agreement covers 19 of our U.S. pulp, paper, and packaging mills; the converting agreement includes 61 of our converting facilities.  In addition, International Paper is party to a master agreement with District Council 2, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, covering 13 additional converting facilities.

During 2015, local labor agreements were negotiated at five mills and 13 converting facilities. In 2016, local labor agreements are scheduled to be negotiated at 29 facilities, including four mills and 25 converting facilities.  26 of these agreements will automatically renew under the terms of the applicable master agreement if new agreements are not reached.

These and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from such forward looking statements are discussed in greater detail below in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

All financial information and statistical measures regarding our 50/50 Ilim joint venture in Russia (“Ilim”), other than historical International Paper Equity Earnings and dividends received by International Paper, have been prepared by the management of Ilim.   In providing this information in this filing, we are relying on the effectiveness of Ilim's internal control environment. Any projected financial information and statistical measures reflect the current views of Ilim management and are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such projections.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (particularly in

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

), or in the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.

RISKS RELATING TO INDUSTRY CONDITIONS

CHANGES IN THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION COULD AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.

We rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda and starch), energy sources (principally natural gas, coal and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. The market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. In addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes

in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.

THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE EXPERIENCE BOTH ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICES OF, AND THE DEMAND FOR, OUR PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. In addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber-based products and non-fiber substitutes. These consumer preferences affect the prices of our products. Consequently, our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products.

COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We operate in a competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally, in all of our operating segments. Product innovations, manufacturing and operating efficiencies, and marketing, distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results.

RISKS RELATING TO MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS

ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN GENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

General economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. In addition, volatility in the capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.

THE LEVEL OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

As of

December 31, 2015

, International Paper had approximately $9.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including $9.3 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our floating and fixed rate notes. There was no indebtedness outstanding under our



credit facilities as of

December 31, 2015

. The level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:

•

it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, dividends, share repurchases, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;

•

a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;

•

the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;

•

our indebtedness that is subject to variable rates of interest exposes us to increased debt service obligations in the event of increased interest rates;

•

it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and

•

it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.

In addition, we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants. A significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives.

CHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS ISSUED BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FINANCING AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

Maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy, and a downgrade of the Company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. The Company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the Company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow, including sale of assets, suspension or reduction of our

dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital.

Under the terms of the agreements governing approximately $2.5 billion of our debt as of

December 31, 2015

, the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating. As a result, a downgrade in our credit rating may lead to an increase in our interest expense. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any such downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.

DOWNGRADES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF BANKS ISSUING CERTAIN LETTERS OF CREDIT WILL INCREASE OUR COST OF MAINTAINING CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS AND MAY RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF DEFERRED TAXES.

We are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes delivered to Temple-Inland in connection with Temple-Inland's 2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating. Since 2007, certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced, or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement. As a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment, a number of the letter-of-credit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited. The downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the Company to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to $840 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained. The deferred taxes are currently recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements.  See

Note 12, Variable Interest Entities

, on pages 64 through 66, and

Note 10, Income Taxes

, on pages 59 through 61, in

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

for further information.

OUR PENSION AND HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FACTORS WHICH COULD CAUSE THESE COSTS TO CHANGE.

We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date. We provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees. Our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.



Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods. Likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs.

Health care reform under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 could also increase costs with respect to medical coverage of the Company’s full-time employees. Significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

OUR PENSION PLANS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERFUNDED, AND OVER TIME WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS TO THE PLANS, REDUCING THE CASH AVAILABLE FOR OUR BUSINESS.

We record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. The benefit liability recorded under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” at

December 31, 2015

was $3.6 billion. The amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.  As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, during the first half of 2016, former employees who are participants in our pension plan will be able to request early payment of their entire plan benefit in the form of a single lump sum payment.  While all payments will be made from the plan's trust assets, the target population has a total liability of $3.0 billion. For further information, see

CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the United States in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. Specifically, Russia, Brazil, Poland, India, and Turkey, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities, are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world. Fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results. Trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including governmental subsidies, tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive

advantage over International Paper, may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries. In addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.

RISKS RELATING TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY CHANGE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS, AND THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and other government requirements -- including, among others, those relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment and health care. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and government requirements will not be changed, applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs.  For example, we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements, including with global climate change laws and regulations, Boiler MACT and NAAQSs, will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. We could also incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.  As another example, we are subject to a number of labor



and employment laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility.

RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

The costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty. Although we do not believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims will have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements, there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS

MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS AT ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. A material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:

•

fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;

•

the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;

•

the effect of other severe weather conditions on equipment and facilities;

•

terrorism or threats of terrorism;

•

domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our Company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world;

•

unscheduled maintenance outages;

•

prolonged power failures;

•

an equipment failure;

•

a chemical spill or release;

•

explosion of a boiler;

•

damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities;

•

disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;

•

widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis;

•

labor difficulties; and

•

other operational problems.

Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. If one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RISKS RELATED TO BREACHES OF SECURITY PERTAINING TO SENSITIVE COMPANY, CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE AND VENDOR INFORMATION AS WELL AS BREACHES IN THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO  MANAGE OPERATIONS AND OTHER BUSINESS PROCESSES.

Our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating and independent third party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers, could become subject to employee error or malfeasance, cyber attacks, or natural disasters. Network, system, application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with International Paper. Access to internal applications required to plan our operations, source materials, manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. Theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents. Any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business.

CERTAIN OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED BY JOINT VENTURES THAT WE CANNOT OPERATE SOLELY FOR OUR BENEFIT.

Certain operations in Russia are carried on by a joint venture, Ilim.  In joint ventures, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources



as we do. In general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. In joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. In addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures.

WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS.

Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accomplish prudent strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and other corporate transactions and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions, and we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits. Among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers placing higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does International Paper.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Operating Earnings (a non-GAAP measure) is defined as net earnings from continuing operations (a GAAP measure) excluding special items and non-operating pension expense. International Paper generated Operating Earnings per diluted share attributable to common shareholders of

$3.65

in


, compared with

$3.00

in


, and

$3.06

in


. Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders were

$2.23

in


, compared with

$1.29

in


and

$3.11

in


.

International Paper delivered solid results during 2015 driven by strong margins and earnings in our North American Industrial Packaging business and record performance from the Ilim joint venture. We generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow which enabled the Company to return cash to our shareholders in the form of approximately $500 million in share repurchases and a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend beginning with the 2015 fourth quarter dividend payment. During 2015, we successfully completed the restructuring of the 2006 timber monetization to achieve our objectives of reducing risk and preserving financial flexibility, while maintaining the deferral of $1.4 billion of deferred income taxes. Finally, with respect to our balanced use of cash, we completed a $2 billion bond issue and related tender offer along with making a $750 million voluntary pension contribution.

Our 2015 results reflect the benefits of favorable input costs offset by price and mix declines across our North American businesses. Volumes were generally flat compared to 2014 except for lower volumes in our North American Industrial Packaging business due to lower containerboard export tons. Input costs decreased versus 2014 largely due to lower energy, chemicals and freight costs. Price declined relative to 2014 driven mainly by lower pricing in our North American Industrial Packaging and Printing Papers and Pulp businesses. Our Ilim joint venture generated record results in 2015 driven by improved operations and increased margins. The positive results were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of non-cash foreign currency movements associated with Ilim’s US dollar denominated debt. Finally, during 2015 we completed the divestiture of our interest in the IP-Sun joint venture, generating $23 million in cash proceeds and removing approximately $400 million of debt from our balance sheet upon completion of the deal.

Overall, 2015 reflects solid performance in what continues to be a challenging economic environment. We once again generated returns in excess of our cost of capital while returning cash to our shareholders in the

form of increased dividends and share repurchases. Our focus on maximizing free cash flow generation and deploying capital in a way that creates additional value for our shareholders has positioned us for another successful year in 2016.

Looking ahead to the 2016 first quarter, we expect seasonally lower volumes in our North American Industrial Packaging business, with some offset from higher export volume which carries a lower margin.  Additionally, we expect seasonally lower volumes in our Brazilian Printing Papers business as the fourth quarter historically represents the strongest volume quarter for this business. Pricing is expected to be lower for our North American Printing Papers and Pulp business, primarily driven by lower pulp prices. Additionally, pricing is expected to be lower in our North American Industrial Packaging business due to lower export pricing and price index changes. We expect price improvements in our EMEA Printing Papers business, including Russia, and Brazilian Printing Papers business following announced price increases although these will be largely offset by inflationary cost pressures. We expect operating performance to be in line with the 2015 fourth quarter with some modest improvement in our North American Industrial Packaging business. Planned maintenance downtime costs should increase, primarily driven by outages in our North American Industrial Packaging and Printing Papers businesses, including costs associated with the Riegelwood mill conversion. Equity earnings from our Ilim joint venture are expected to benefit from strong operations offset by softwood pulp price pressure and normal seasonality.  Additionally, we expect Ilim’s earnings to be impacted by the absence of the positive impact from foreign currency movements driven by Ilim’s U.S. dollar denominated debt as we assume no change in foreign currency rates in our outlook.

For the 2016 full year, we continue to face an uncertain macroeconomic environment but believe we are well positioned to deal with whatever the market brings. We will continue to improve our North American Industrial Packaging business by further realizing optimization opportunities during 2016. We expect to complete the Riegelwood mill conversion during first half of 2016 and be fully ramped by the 2016 fourth quarter, initially producing softwood market pulp. Additionally, we will continue executing against our plan to drive profitable growth following the recent expansion within the Foodservice business as well as optimizing commercial opportunities and mix within the North American Printing Papers portfolio.  Finally, we will remain focused on maximizing free cash flow generation and deploying that capital in a way that creates additional value for our shareholders.



Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) of

$1.8 billion

generated in


was lower than the

$2.1 billion

generated in


and even with the

$1.8 billion

generated in


(see reconciliation on page 30).

Operating Earnings per share attributable to common shareholders of

$0.87

in the 2015 fourth quarter were lower than the

$0.97

in the 2015 third quarter, but higher than the

$0.53

in the 2014 fourth quarter. Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders were

$0.43

in the 2015 fourth quarter, compared with

$0.53

in the 2015 third quarter and

$0.32

in the 2014 fourth quarter.

Free cash flow of

$501 million

generated in the


fourth quarter was lower than the

$512 million

generated in the


third quarter and the

$739 million

generated in the


fourth quarter (see reconciliation on page 30).

Operating Earnings and Operating Earnings Per Share are non-GAAP measures. Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to International Paper Company common shareholders is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The Company calculates Operating Earnings by excluding the after-tax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under GAAP, non-operating pension expense and discontinued operations. Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. The Company believes that using this information, along with the most directly comparable GAAP measure, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations. The following are reconciliations of Operating Earnings per share attributable to International Paper Company common shareholders to diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to International Paper Company common shareholders.

Results of Operations

Industry segment operating profits are used by International Paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes, equity earnings, noncontrolling interests, interest expense, corporate items and corporate special items. Industry segment operating profits are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-GAAP financial measure, and are not GAAP alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

International Paper operates in three segments: Industrial Packaging, Printing Papers and Consumer Packaging.



The following table presents a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) attributable to International Paper Company to its total industry segment operating profit:

Industry segment operating profits in


included a net loss from special items of $321 million compared with $732 million in


and $336 million in


.

Operationally, compared with 2014, the benefit from lower input costs ($232 million) was offset by lower average sales price realizations and mix ($226 million), lower sales volumes ($38 million), higher operating costs ($16 million), higher maintenance outage costs ($37 million) and higher other costs ($23 million).

The principal changes in operating profit by segment were as follows:

•

Industrial Packaging’s profits of $1.9 billion were $43 million lower than in 2014 as the benefit of lower input costs was offset by lower average sales price realizations and mix, lower sales volumes, higher operating costs and higher maintenance outage costs. In addition, 2015 operating profits included a goodwill and trade name impairment charge of $137 million related to our Brazil Packaging business.  Operating profits in  2014  included $16 million of costs associated with the integration of Temple-Inland, a goodwill impairment charge of $100 million related to our Asia Industrial Packaging business, a charge of $35 million for costs associated with a multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability and a net charge of $7 million for other items.

•

Printing Papers’ profits of $533 million represented a $549 million increase in operating profits from 2014. The benefits from lower input costs, lower costs associated with the closure of our Courtland, Alabama mill and lower foreign exchange impact were offset by lower average sales price realizations and mix, lower sales volumes, higher operating costs and higher maintenance outage costs. The 2014 operating loss included a special items charge of $554 million for costs associated with the shutdown of our Courtland, Alabama mill, a gain of $20 million for the resolution of a legal contingency in India and a charge of $32 million for costs associated with a foreign tax amnesty program.

•

Consumer Packaging’s operating loss of $25 million represented a  $203 million reduction in operating profits from 2014. The benefits from higher sales volumes, lower planned maintenance downtime costs and lower input costs were offset by lower average sales price realizations and mix, higher operating costs, and higher foreign exchange and other expenses. In addition, 2015 operating profits included an asset impairment charge of $174 million



related to the sale of our 55% equity share of the IP-Sun JV in Asia, a net cost of $8 million related to costs to convert our Riegelwood mill to 100% pulp production, net of proceeds from the sale of the Carolina Coated Bristols brand, and $2 million of sheet plant closure costs. Operating profits in 2014 included $8 million of sheet plant closure costs.

Corporate items, net, of

$36 million

of expense in


were lower than the

$51 million

of expense in


due to the absence of a one-time non-cash foreign exchange charge related to the administrative restructuring of some international entities in 2014. The decrease in


from the expense of $61 million in


is due to lower pension costs partially offset by the one-time non-cash foreign exchange charge.

Corporate special items, including restructuring and other items and net losses on sales and impairments of businesses were a loss of

$238 million

in


compared with a loss of

$320 million

in


and a loss of

$4 million

in


.  The loss in 2015 is due to debt premium costs,   costs associated with the restructure of our timber monetization and a legal liability reserve adjustment. The loss in 2014 is primarily due to debt extinguishment costs and a loss on the sale of a business by ASG, which was formerly referred to as AGI-Shorewood and in which we hold an investment, and the subsequent partial impairment of our ASG investment.

Interest expense, net, was

$555 million

in


compared with $607 million (

$601 million

excluding special items net interest expense reported in the Printing Papers business segment)  in


and

$612 million

in


.  The decrease in 2015 compared with 2014 is due to lower average interest rates. The decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 also reflects lower average interest rates.

A net income tax provision of

$466 million

was recorded for


, including a tax benefit of $62 million related to internal restructurings, an  expense of $23 million for the  tax impact of the 2015 cash pension contribution of $750 million and a tax expense of $2 million for other items. The

Discontinued Operations

2014:

On July 1, 2014, International Paper completed the spinoff of its distribution business, xpedx,  which subsequently merged with Unisource Worldwide, Inc., with the combined companies now operating as Veritiv Corporation (Veritiv). The xpedx business had historically represented the Company's Distribution reportable segment.

The spinoff was accomplished by the contribution of the xpedx business to Veritiv and the distribution of

8,160,000

shares of Veritiv common stock on a pro-rata basis to International Paper shareholders. International Paper received payments of approximately $411 million,  financed with new debt in Veritiv's capital structure.

2013:

On April 1, 2013, the Company finalized the sale of Temple-Inland's

50%

interest in Del-Tin Fiber L.L.C. to joint venture partner Deltic Timber Corporation for

$20 million

in assumed liabilities and cash.

On July 19, 2013 the Company finalized the sale of its Temple-Inland Building Products division to Georgia-Pacific Building Products, LLC for approximately

$726 million

in cash.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, International Paper generated

$2.6 billion

of cash flow from operations compared with

$3.1 billion

in


and

$3.0 billion

in


. Cash flow from operations included $750 million, $353 and $31 million of cash pension contributions in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Capital spending for


totaled

$1.5 billion

, or

115%

of depreciation and amortization expense. Net decreases in debt totaled

$74 million

. Our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $2.1 billion of credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements. Maintaining an investment-grade credit rating for our long-term debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy.

We expect to generate strong free cash flow again in


and will continue our balanced use of cash through investments in capital projects, the reduction of total debt, including the Company’s unfunded pension obligation, returning value to shareholders and strengthening our businesses through strategic acquisitions, as appropriate.

Capital spending for


is targeted at

$1.3 billion

, or about

100%

of depreciation and amortization.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW

While the operating results for International Paper’s various business segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes in International Paper’s operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in North America, Europe, Russia, Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Factors that impact the demand for our products include



industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels, and movements in currency exchange rates.

Product prices are affected by general economic trends, inventory levels, currency exchange rate movements and worldwide capacity utilization. In addition to these revenue-related factors, net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood, recycled fiber and chemical costs; energy costs; freight costs; salary and benefits costs, including pensions; and manufacturing conversion costs.

The following is a discussion of International Paper’s results of operations for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, and the major factors affecting these results compared to

$1.7 billion

, including

$528 million

of  net special items gains and $197 million of non-operating pension expense in


. Compared with


, the benefits from lower input costs, lower corporate and other costs and lower interest expense were offset by lower average sales price realizations and mix, lower sales volumes, higher operating costs, higher maintenance outage costs, and higher tax expense.  In addition,


results included higher equity earnings, net of taxes, relating to the Company’s investment in Ilim Holdings, SA.

Corporate Items and Interest Expense

Corporate items totaled

$36 million

of expense for the year ended

December 31, 2015

compared with

$51 million

in


and

$61 million

in


. The decrease in


from


reflects the absence of a one-time non-cash foreign exchange charge related to the administrative restructuring of some international entities that occurred in 2014. The decrease in 2014 from 2013 reflects lower pension expenses partially offset by a one-time non-cash foreign exchange  charge related to the administrative restructuring of some international entities.

Net corporate interest expense totaled

$555 million

in


,

$601 million

in


and

$612 million

in


.

The decrease in 2015 compared with 2014 reflects lower average interest rates. The decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 also reflects lower average interest rates.

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests totaled a loss of

$21 million

in


compared with a loss of

$19 million

in


and a loss of

$17 million

in


.  The decrease in 2015 reflects the sale of our equity share of the IP-Sun JV and lower earnings for the Shandong IP & Sun Food Packaging Co., Ltd joint venture in China prior to its divestiture. The decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 reflects the impact of the acquisition of the remaining 25% share of Orsa IP from the joint venture partner.

Special Items

Restructuring and Other Charges

International Paper continually evaluates its operations for improvement opportunities targeted to (a) focus our portfolio on our core businesses, (b) rationalize and realign capacity to operate fewer facilities with the same

revenue capability and close high cost facilities, and (c) reduce costs. Annually, strategic operating plans are developed by each of our businesses. If it subsequently becomes apparent that a facility’s plan will not be achieved, a decision is then made to (a) invest additional capital to upgrade the facility, (b) shut down the facility and record the corresponding charge, or (c) evaluate the expected recovery of the carrying value of the facility to determine if an impairment of the assets have occurred. In recent years, this policy has led to the shutdown of a number of facilities and the recording of significant asset impairment charges and severance costs. It is possible that additional charges and costs will be incurred in future periods in our core businesses should such triggering events occur.

Impairments of Goodwill

In the fourth quarter of 2015, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the Company calculated the estimated fair value of its Brazil Packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in the business, totaling

$137 million

, should be written off. The decline in the fair value of the Brazil Packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to the negative impacts on the cash flows of the business caused by the continued decline of the overall Brazilian economy.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the Company calculated the estimated

fair value of its Asia Industrial Packaging business using expected discounted future cash flows and determined that due to a change in the strategic outlook, all of the goodwill of this business, totaling

$100 million

, should be written off. The decline in the fair value of the Asia Industrial Packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the business.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the Company calculated the estimated fair value of its India Papers business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill of this business, totaling

$112 million

, should be written off. The decline in the fair value of the India Papers reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the India Papers operations.

Also in the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company calculated the estimated fair value of its xpedx business using the discounted future cash flows and wrote off all of the goodwill of its xpedx business, totaling $400 million, which has been included in Discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The decline in the fair value of the xpedx reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a significant decline in earnings and a change in the strategic outlook for the xpedx operations.

Also during 2013, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $15 million ($7 million after taxes and noncontrolling interest) for the impairment of a trade name intangible asset related to our India Papers business.

interest in IP Asia Coated Paperboard (IP-Sun JV) business, within the Company's Consumer Packaging segment, to its Chinese coated board joint venture partner, Shandong Sun Holding Group Co., Ltd. for RMB

149 million

(approximately USD

$23 million

). During the third quarter of 2015, a determination was made that the current book value of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value of

$23 million

, which was the agreed upon selling price. The 2015 loss includes the pre-tax impairment charge of

$174 million

(

$113 million

after taxes). A pre-tax charge of

$186



million

was recorded during the third quarter in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment to write down the long-lived assets of this business to their estimated fair value.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, upon the sale and corresponding deconsolidation of IP-Sun JV from the Company's consolidated balance sheet, final  adjustments were made resulting in a reduction of the impairment of

$12 million

. The amount of pre-tax losses related to noncontrolling interest of the IP-Sun JV included in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were

INDUSTRY SEGMENT RESULTS

Industrial Packaging

Demand for Industrial Packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods production, as well as with demand for processed foods, poultry, meat and agricultural products. In addition to prices and volumes, major factors affecting the profitability of Industrial Packaging are raw material and energy costs, freight costs, manufacturing efficiency and product mix.

Sales volumes decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 reflecting slightly lower box shipments and lower shipments of containerboard to export markets.  In 2015, the business took about 814,000 tons of total downtime of which about 363,000 were market-related and 451,000 were maintenance downtime. The business took about 622,000 tons of total downtime in 2014 of which 240,000 were market-related and 382,000 were maintenance downtime. Average sales price realizations were lower mostly for Euro-denominated shipments of containerboard to export markets.  Input costs were lower, primarily for energy.  Distribution costs were flat as lower freight fuel surcharges offset rate increases. Planned maintenance downtime costs were $15 million higher than in 2014. Manufacturing operating costs decreased, but were more than offset by wage and benefit inflation. Depreciation costs were lower.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2016, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, sales volumes for boxes are expected to be seasonally lower, while shipments of containerboard to export markets should increase.  Input costs are expected to be higher for energy and wood, but lower for waste fiber. Planned maintenance downtime spending is expected to be about $21 million higher. Manufacturing operating costs are expected to improve.

Sales volumes in 2015 were higher than in 2014 reflecting improved market demand and strong commercial initiatives in the Eurozone throughout the year and growth in Morocco and Turkey in the fourth quarter.  Net sales decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Higher board costs also contributed to lower average sales margins. Other input costs, primarily for energy, were lower.  Operating earnings in 2015 also included a gain of $4 million related to the change in ownership of our OCC collection operations in Turkey.

Entering the first quarter of 2016, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 sales volumes are expected to be flat. Average sales margins are expected to be favorably impacted by higher box sales prices, lower board costs in Turkey and a favorable mix. Input costs for energy should be slightly higher.

and a loss of

$2 million

(a gain of

$2 million

excluding acquisition and integration costs) in


.

Sales volumes in 2015 decreased compared with 2014 due to overall weak economic conditions and lower box consumption in the product segments of some of our key customers. Average sales price realizations for boxes were lower. Input costs were slightly higher. Operating costs also increased. Planned maintenance downtime costs were $1 million lower in 2015 compared with 2014.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2016, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower. Average sales margins should improve reflecting a previously announced sales price increase for boxes.  Input costs are expected to be stable and operating costs should reflect the benefits of cost savings initiatives.

. Compared with 2014, sales volumes for boxes in 2015 were lower and average sales margins decreased due to competitive price pressures and an unfavorable sales mix. However, operating costs were lower.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2016, sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower.  On October 8, 2015, the Company announced that it was pursuing strategic options for its corrugated box business in China and Southeast Asia and had signed a non-binding letter of intent with a prospective buyer.

Demand for Printing Papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity, direct mail volumes and, for uncoated cut-size products, with changes in white-collar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper. Pulp is further affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage producers in different geographic regions. Principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency, raw material and energy costs and freight costs.

Benefits from lower input costs ($18 million), lower costs associated with the closure of our Courtland, Alabama mill ($44 million) and favorable foreign exchange ($33 million) were offset by lower  average sales price realizations and mix ($52 million), lower sales volumes ($16 million), higher operating costs ($18 million) and higher planned maintenance downtime costs ($26 million).  In addition, operating profits in 2014 include special items costs of $554 million associated with the closure of our Courtland, Alabama mill.  During 2013, the Company accelerated depreciation for certain Courtland assets, and evaluated certain other assets for possible alternative uses by one of our other businesses. The net book value of these assets at December 31, 2013 was approximately $470 million.  In the first quarter of 2014, we completed our evaluation and concluded that there were no alternative uses for these assets.  We recognized approximately $464 million of accelerated depreciation related to these assets in 2014. Operating profits in 2014 also include a charge of $32 million associated with a foreign tax amnesty program, and a gain of $20 million for the resolution of a legal contingency in India, while operating profits in 2013 included costs of $118 million associated with the announced closure of our Courtland, Alabama mill and a $123 million impairment charge associated with goodwill and a trade name intangible asset in our India Papers business.

Sales volumes in 2015 decreased compared with 2014 primarily due to the closure of our Courtland mill in 2014. Shipments to the domestic market increased, but export shipments declined.  Average sales price realizations decreased, primarily in the domestic market.  Input costs were lower, mainly for energy. Planned maintenance downtime costs were $12 million higher in 2015. Operating profits in 2014 were negatively impacted by costs associated with the shutdown of our Courtland, Alabama mill.

Entering the first quarter of 2016, sales volumes are expected to be up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2015.  Average sales margins should be about flat reflecting lower average sales price realizations offset by a more favorable product mix. Input costs are expected to be stable. Planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $14 million lower with an outage scheduled in the 2016 first quarter at our Georgetown mill compared with

outages at our Eastover and Riverdale mills in the 2015 fourth quarter.

In January 2015, the United Steelworkers, Domtar Corporation, Packaging Corporation of America, Finch Paper LLC and P. H. Glatfelter Company (the Petitioners) filed an anti-dumping petition before the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) and the United States Department of Commerce (DOC) alleging that paper producers in China, Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, and Portugal are selling uncoated free sheet paper in sheet form (the Products) in violation of international trade rules. The Petitioners also filed a countervailing-duties petition with these agencies regarding imports of the Products from China and Indonesia. In January 2016, the DOC announced its final   countervailing duty rates on imports of the Products to the United States from certain producers from China and Indonesia.  Also, in January 2016, the DOC announced its final anti-dumping duty rates on imports of the Products to the United States from certain producers from Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia and Portugal.  In February 2016, the ITC concluded its anti-dumping and countervailing duties investigations and made a final determination that the U.S. market had been injured by imports of the Products. Accordingly, the DOC’s previously announced countervailing duty rates and anti-dumping duty rates will be in effect for a minimum of five years.  We do not believe the impact of these rates will have a material, adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Sales volumes in 2015 were lower compared with 2014 reflecting weak economic conditions and the absence of 2014 one-time events. Average sales price realizations improved for domestic uncoated freesheet paper due to the realization of price increases implemented in the second half of 2015. Margins were unfavorably affected by an increased proportion of sales to the lower-margin export markets. Raw material costs increased for energy and wood. Operating costs were higher than in 2014, while planned maintenance downtime costs were $4 million lower.



Looking ahead to 2016, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 sales volumes in the first quarter are expected to decrease due to seasonally weaker customer demand for uncoated freesheet paper. Average sales price improvements are expected to reflect the partial realization of announced sales price increases in the Brazilian domestic market for uncoated freesheet paper.  Input costs are expected to be slightly higher for chemicals and electricity.

Compared with 2014, sales volumes for uncoated freesheet paper in 2015 were slightly lower in both Russia and Europe.  Average sales price realizations for uncoated freesheet paper increased in Russia, but remained flat in Europe, reflecting tight demand and supply conditions in the first half of the year. Input costs increased slightly as higher costs for wood, chemicals and energy in Russia were largely offset by lower costs in Europe.  Planned maintenance downtime costs were $11 million higher in 2015 than in 2014.

Entering 2016, domestic sales volumes in the first quarter are expected to be seasonally weaker in Russia, and stable in Europe.  Average sales price realizations for uncoated freesheet paper are expected to reflect the impact of announced price increases in both Europe and Russia. Input costs should be slightly higher for wood and chemicals.  Planned maintenance downtime costs should be $1 million lower than in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Sales volumes in 2015 decreased from 2014 with lower softwood pulp volumes being partially offset by higher  fluff pulp volumes.  Average sales price realizations were lower for both fluff pulp and softwood market pulp. Input costs decreased primarily for energy. Operating costs were higher, but distribution costs were lower. Planned maintenance downtime costs were $4 million lower in 2015 than in 2014.

Compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, sales volumes in the first quarter of 2016 are expected to be stable.  Average sales price realizations are expected to be lower for fluff pulp and softwood market pulp. Input costs should be higher for fuels and utilities. Planned maintenance downtime costs should be about $45 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2015 including outage costs associated with the conversion of our Riegelwood mill to 100% pulp production.

Coated Paperboard sales volumes in 2015 were lower than in 2014 reflecting weaker market demand.  The business took about 77,000 tons of market-related downtime in 2015 compared with about 41,000 tons in 2014.   Average sales price realizations increased modestly year over year as competitive pressures in the current year only partially offset the impact of sales price increases implemented in 2014. Input costs decreased for energy and chemicals, but wood costs increased. Planned maintenance downtime costs were $10 million lower in 2015.  Operating costs were higher, mainly due to inflation and overhead costs.

Foodservice sales volumes increased in 2015 compared with 2014 reflecting strong market demand. Average sales margins increased due to lower resin costs and a more favorable mix.  Operating costs and distribution costs were both higher.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2016, Coated Paperboard sales volumes are expected to be slightly lower than in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to our exit from the coated bristols market. Average sales price realizations are expected to be flat, but margins should benefit from a more favorable product mix. Input costs are expected to be higher for wood, chemicals and energy. Planned maintenance downtime costs should be $4 million higher with a planned maintenance outage scheduled at our Augusta mill in the first quarter. Foodservice sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower. Average sales margins are expected to improve due to a more favorable mix. Operating costs are expected to decrease.

Sales volumes and average sales price realizations were lower in 2015 due to over-supplied market conditions and competitive pressures. Average sales margins were also negatively impacted by a less favorable mix. Input costs and freight costs were lower and operating costs also decreased.

On October 13, 2015

,

the Company finalized the sale of its

55%

interest in IP Asia Coated Paperboard (IP-Sun JV) business, within the Company's Consumer Packaging segment, to its Chinese coated board joint venture partner, Shandong Sun Holding Group Co., Ltd. for RMB

149 million

(approximately USD

$23 million

). During the third quarter of 2015, a determination was made that the current book value of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value of

$23 million

, which was the agreed upon selling price. The 2015 loss includes the net pre-tax impairment charge of

$174 million

(

$113 million

after taxes). A pre-tax charge of

$186 million

was recorded during the third quarter in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment to write down the long-lived assets of this business to their estimated fair value.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, upon the sale and corresponding deconsolidation of IP-Sun JV from the Company's consolidated balance sheet, final  adjustments were made resulting in a reduction of the impairment of

$12 million

. The amount of pre-tax losses related to noncontrolling interest of the IP-Sun JV included in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were

Equity Earnings, Net of Taxes – Ilim Holding S.A.

International Paper accounts for its investment in Ilim Holding S.A. (Ilim), a separate reportable industry segment, using the equity method of accounting.

The Company recorded equity earnings, net of taxes, related to Ilim of

$131 million

in


compared with a loss of

$194 million

in


and a loss of

$46 million

in


. Operating results recorded in 2015 included an after-tax non-cash foreign exchange loss of

$75 million

compared with an after-tax foreign exchange loss of

$269 million

in 2014 and an after-tax foreign exchange loss of

$32 million

in 2013 primarily on the remeasurement of Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt.

Sales volumes for the joint venture increased year over year for shipments to China of hardwood pulp and softwood pulp, but decreased for linerboard. Sales volumes in the domestic Russian market increased for hardwood pulp and paper, but decreased for softwood pulp and linerboard.  Average sales price realizations were higher in 2015 for sales of hardwood pulp to export markets and linerboard to the domestic market, but  were offset by lower average sales price realizations for sales of softwood pulp to export markets. Input costs increased year-over-year for wood, chemicals, fuel and energy.  Freight costs also increased. The Company received cash dividends from the joint venture of $35 million in 2015 and $56 million in 2014. No dividends were paid in 2013.

Entering the first quarter of 2016, sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower than in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the January holidays in Russia. Average sales price realizations are expected to decrease for exported hardwood pulp, softwood pulp and containerboard, slightly offset by higher average sales price realizations for paper in the domestic market. Input costs for energy, chemicals and wood should be higher and distribution costs are also expected to increase.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

A major factor in International Paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products. While changes in key cash operating costs, such as energy, raw material and transportation costs, do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus

on pricing and cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.

Cash uses during


were primarily focused on working capital requirements, capital spending, debt reductions and returning cash to shareholders.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Cash provided by operations totaled

$2.6 billion

in


compared with

$3.1 billion

for


and

$3.0 billion

for


.

The major components of cash provided by operations are earnings from operations adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, cash pension contributions and changes in working capital. Earnings from operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expense items and cash pension contributions decreased by

$433 million

in


versus


driven mainly by increased cash pension contributions in 2015. Cash used for working capital components, accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable and other totaled

$222 million

in


, compared with a cash use of

$158 million

in


and a cash use of

$486 million

in


.

The Company generated free cash flow of approximately

$1.8 billion

,

$2.1 billion

and

$1.8 billion

in


,


and


, respectively. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the most comparable GAAP measure is cash provided by operations. Management uses free cash flow as a liquidity metric because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available to maintain our assets, make investments or acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce debt. The following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations:



Alternative Fuel Mixture Credit

On July 19, 2011, the Company filed an amended 2009 tax return claiming alternative fuel mixture tax credits as non-taxable income. The amended position has been accepted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the closing of the IRS tax audit for the years 2006 - 2009. As a result, during 2013, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of

$753 million

related to the non-taxability of the alternative fuel mixture tax credits.

Investment Activities

Investment activities in


were up from


reflecting an increase in capital spending and the use of $198 million of cash in conjunction with the timber monetization restructuring (see

Note 12 Variable Interest Entities and Preferred Securities of Subsidiaries

on pages 64 through 66 of

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

) in 2015. In addition, 2014 investment activity includes the receipt of approximately $400 million in connection with the spin-off of the xpedx distribution business. The Company maintains an average capital spending target around depreciation or amortization levels or modestly above due to strategic plans over the course of an economic cycle. Capital spending was

$1.5 billion

in


, or

115%

of depreciation and amortization, compared with

$1.4 billion

Acquisitions and Joint Ventures

OLMUKSAN

2014:

In May 2014, the Company conducted a voluntary tender offer for the remaining outstanding

12.6%

public shares of Olmuksan. The Company also purchased outstanding shares of Olmuksan outside of the tender offer. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company owned

91.7%

of Olmuksan's outstanding and issued shares.

2013:

On January 3, 2013, International Paper completed the acquisition (effective date of acquisition on January 1, 2013)  of the shares of its joint venture partner, Sabanci Holding, in the Turkish corrugated packaging company, Olmuksa International Paper Sabanci Ambalaj Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., now called Olmuksan International Paper Ambalaj Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. (Olmuksan), for a purchase price of

$56 million

. The acquired shares represented

43.7%

of Olmuksan's shares. Prior to this acquisition, International Paper held a

43.7%

equity interest in Olmuksan.

Because the transaction resulted in International Paper becoming the majority shareholder, owning

87.4%

of Olmuksan's outstanding and issued shares, its completion triggered a mandatory call for tender of the remaining public shares which began in March 2013 and ended in April 2013, with no shares tendered.  As a result, the

12.6%

owned by other parties were considered non-controlling interests.  Olmuksan's financial results have been consolidated with the Company's Industrial Packaging segment beginning January 1, 2013, the effective date which International Paper obtained majority control of the entity.

Following the transaction, the Company's previously held

43.7%

equity interest in Olmuksan was remeasured to a fair value of

$75 million

, resulting in a gain of

$9 million

. In addition, the cumulative translation adjustment balance of

$17 million

relating to the previously held equity interest was reclassified, as expense, from accumulated other comprehensive income.

The final purchase price allocation indicated that the sum of the cash consideration paid, the fair value of the noncontrolling interest and the fair value of the previously held interest was less than the fair value of the underlying assets by

$21 million

, resulting in a bargain purchase price gain being recorded on this transaction. The aforementioned remeasurement of equity interest gain, the cumulative translation adjustment to expense, and the bargain purchase gain are included in the Net bargain purchase gain on acquisition of business in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

ORSA

2014:

On April 8, 2014, the Company acquired the remaining

25%

of shares of Orsa International Paper Embalangens S.A. (Orsa IP) from its joint venture



partner, Jari Celulose, Papel e Embalagens S.A. (Jari), a Grupo Orsa company, for approximately

$127 million

, of which

$105 million

was paid in cash with the remaining

$22 million

held back pending satisfaction of certain indemnification obligations by Jari. International Paper will  release the amount held back, or any amount for which we have not notified Jari of a claim, by March 30, 2016. An additional

$11 million

, which was not included in the purchase price, was placed in an escrow account pending resolution of certain open matters. During 2014, these open matters were successfully resolved, which resulted in

$9 million

paid out of escrow to Jari and correspondingly added to the final purchase consideration. The remaining

$2 million

was released back to the Company.  As a result of this transaction, the Company reversed the

$168 million

of Redeemable noncontrolling interest included on the March 31, 2014 consolidated balance sheet. The net difference between the Redeemable noncontrolling interest balance plus

$14 million

of currency translation adjustment reclassified out of Other comprehensive income less the

25%

purchase price was reflected as an increase to Retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet.

2013:

On January 14, 2013, International Paper and Jari formed Orsa IP with International Paper holding a

75%

stake. The value of International Paper's investment in Orsa IP was approximately

$471 million

. Because International Paper acquired a majority control of the joint venture, Orsa IP's financial results have been consolidated with our Industrial Packaging segment from the date of formation on January 14, 2013.  The

25%

owned by Jari was considered a redeemable noncontrolling interest and met the requirements to be classified outside permanent equity. As such, the Company reported

$163 million

in Redeemable noncontrolling interest in the December 31, 2013 consolidated balance sheet.

Financing Activities

Amounts related to early debt extinguishment during the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


were as follows:

(a)

Reductions related to notes with interest rates ranging from

2.00%

to

9.38%

with original maturities from


to


for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


. Includes the $630 million payment for a portion of the Special Purpose Entity Liability (see

Note 12 Variable Interest Entities

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

).

(b)

Amounts are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

2015:

Financing activities during 2015 included debt issuances of

$6.9 billion

and retirements of

$6.9 billion

for a net decrease of

$74 million

.

During 2015, the Company restructured the timber monetization which resulted in the use of $630 million in cash to pay down a portion of the third party bank loans and refinance the loans on nonrecourse terms. (see

Note 12 Variable Interest Entities

on pages 64 through 66 of

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

).

International Paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and manage interest expense. At December 31, 2015, International Paper had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $17 million and maturities in 2018 (see

Note 14 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

on pages 67 through 71 of

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

). During 2015, existing swaps and the amortization of deferred gains on previously terminated swaps decreased the weighted average cost of debt from 5.9% to an effective rate of 5.8%. The inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short-term investments reduced this effective rate to 5.1%.

In 2015, International Paper issued $700 million of 3.80% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in 2026, $600 million of 5.00% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in 2035, and $700 million of 5.15% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in 2046. The proceeds from this borrowing were used to repay approximately $1.0 billion of notes with interest rates ranging from 4.75% to 9.38% and original maturities from 2018 to 2022, along with $211 million of cash premiums associated with the debt repayments. Additionally, the proceeds from this borrowing were used to make a $750 million voluntary cash contribution to the Company's pension plan. Pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $207 million related to the debt repayments, including the $211 million of cash premiums, are included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.

Other financing activities during 2015 included the net repurchase of approximately 8.0 million shares of treasury stock, including restricted stock withholding, and the issuance of  62,000 shares of common stock for various plans, including stock options exercises that generated approximately $2.4 million of cash. Repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $604.6 million, including $522.6 million related to shares repurchased under the Company's share repurchase program.



In October 2015, International Paper announced that the quarterly dividend would be increased from $0.40 per share to $0.44 per share, effective for the 2015 fourth quarter.

2014:

Financing activities during 2014 included debt issuances of

$2.0 billion

and retirements of

$2.1 billion

, for a net

decrease

of

$113 million

). During 2014, existing swaps and the amortization of deferred gains on previously terminated swaps decreased the weighted average cost of debt from 6.8% to an effective rate of 6.7%. The inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short-term investments reduced this effective rate to 6.3%.

During the second quarter of 2014, International Paper issued

$800 million

of

3.65%

senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in


and

$800 million

of 4.80% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in


. The proceeds from this borrowing were used to repay approximately

$960 million

of notes with interest rates ranging from

7.95%

to

9.38%

and original maturities from


to


. Pre-tax early debt retirement costs of

$262 million

related to these debt repayments, including

$258 million

of cash premiums, are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.

Other financing activities during 2014 included the net repurchase of approximately 17.9 million shares of treasury stock, including restricted stock withholding, and the issuance of  1.6 million shares of common stock for various plans, including stock options exercises that generated approximately $66 million of cash. Repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $1.06 billion, including $983 million related to shares repurchased under the Company's share repurchase program.

In September 2014, International Paper announced that the quarterly dividend would be increased from $0.35 per share to $0.40 per share, effective for the 2014 fourth quarter.

Financing activities during 2013 included debt issuances of

$241 million

and retirements of

$845 million

International Paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and manage interest expense. At December 31, 2013, International Paper had interest rate swaps with a total

notional amount of $175 million and maturities in 2018 (see

Note 14 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

on pages 67 through 71 of

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

). During 2013, existing swaps and the amortization of deferred gains on previously terminated swaps decreased the weighted average cost of debt from 6.7% to an effective rate of 6.5%. The inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short-term investments reduced this effective rate to 6.2%.

Other financing activities during 2013 included the net repurchase of approximately 10.9 million shares of treasury stock, including restricted stock withholding, and the issuance of  7.3 million shares of common stock for various plans, including stock options exercises that generated approximately $298 million of cash. Repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $512 million, including $461 million related to shares repurchased under the Company's share repurchase program.

In September 2013, International Paper announced that the quarterly dividend would be increased from $0.30 per share to $0.35 per share, effective for the 2013  fourth quarter.

Variable Interest Entities

Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook for


Capital Expenditures and Long-Term Debt

International Paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures, service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements during


through current cash balances and cash from operations. Additionally, the Company has existing credit facilities totaling $2.1 billion available at December 31, 2015.

The Company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at

December 31, 2015

. The Company’s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of $9 billion and a total debt-to-capital ratio of less than 60%. Net worth is defined as the sum of common stock, paid-in capital and retained earnings, less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges. The calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and Nonrecourse Financial Liabilities of Special Purpose Entities. The total debt-to-capital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth. At

December 31, 2015

, International Paper’s net worth was $14.1 billion, and the total-debt-to-capital ratio was 39.8%.



The Company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows. Funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives. The primary goals of the Company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense. The majority of International Paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors.

Maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of International Paper’s financing strategy. At

December 31, 2015

, the Company held long-term credit ratings of BBB (stable outlook) and Baa2 (stable outlook) by S&P and Moody’s, respectively.

Contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at

December 31, 2015

, were as follows:

(a)

Total debt includes scheduled principal payments only.

(b)

Includes

$2.1 billion

relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the 2006 Transformation Plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of Weyerhaeuser Company’s Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business.

(c)

Not included in the above table due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $101 million.

We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2015

, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon. As of

December 31, 2015

, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $600 million. We do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.

Pension Obligations and Funding

At

December 31, 2015

, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s U.S. defined benefit plans determined under U.S. GAAP was approximately

$3.5 billion

higher than the fair value of plan assets. Approximately $3.2 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements. Under current IRS funding rules, the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits

(the projected benefit obligation) for accounting purposes. In December 2008, the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 (WERA) was passed by the U.S. Congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections. Funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the Company, and the timing of its implementation, as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make contributions totaling

$750 million

and

$353 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively. At this time, we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in


, although the Company may elect to make future voluntary contributions. The timing and amount of future contributions, which could be material, will depend on a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates. International Paper has announced a voluntary, limited-time opportunity for former employees who are participants in the Retirement Plan of International Paper Company (the Pension Plan) to request early payment of their entire Pension Plan benefit in the form of a single lump sum payment. Eligible participants who wish to receive the lump sum payment must make an election between February 29 and April 29, 2016, and payment is scheduled to be made on or before June 30, 2016. All payments will be made from the Pension Plan trust assets. The target population has a total liability of $3.0 billion. The amount of the total payments will depend on the participation rate of eligible participants, but is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Based on the expected level of payments, settlement accounting rules will apply in the period in which the payments are made.  This will result in a plan remeasurement and the recognition in earnings of a pro-rata portion of unamortized net actuarial loss.

Ilim Holding S.A. Shareholder’s Agreement

In October 2007, in connection with the formation of the Ilim Holding S.A. joint venture, International Paper entered into a shareholder’s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners. This agreement was amended on May 7, 2014. Pursuant to the amended agreement, beginning on January 1, 2017, either the Company or its partners may commence certain procedures specified under the deadlock provisions.  If these or any other deadlock provisions are commenced, the Company may in certain situations, choose to purchase its partners’

50%

interest in Ilim. Any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by Russian and other relevant antitrust authorities. Any such purchase by International Paper would result in the consolidation of Ilim’s financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires International Paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of International Paper, and that can require judgments by management that affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and postretirement benefit obligations, stock options and income taxes. The Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.

Contingent Liabilities

Accruals for contingent liabilities, including legal and environmental matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel. Liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

An impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations. A goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. Assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. Additionally, testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually. The amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, and various other projected operating economic factors. As these

key factors change in future periods, the Company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections.

Under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,” the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units is compared with their carrying value, including goodwill. If fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered to be impaired. If the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value, then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit. This analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any currently unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date. Once these fair values have been determined, the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two. The carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value, or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, through a goodwill impairment charge.

The impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management. In calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one, the Company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets, discounted using the estimated cost-of-capital discount rate for each reporting unit. These calculations require many estimates, including discount rates, future growth rates, and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit. Subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods. Upon completion, the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions, and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the Company’s market price per share on the analysis date.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the Company calculated the estimated fair value of its Brazil Packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in the business, totaling

$137 million

, should be written off. The decline in the fair value of the Brazil Packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to the negative impacts on the cash



flows of the business caused by the continued decline of the overall Brazilian economy.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the Company calculated the estimated fair value of its Asia Industrial Packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in this business, totaling

$100 million

, should be written off. The decline in the fair value of the Asia Industrial Packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the business.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the Company calculated the estimated fair value of its India Papers business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill of this business, totaling

$112 million

, should be written off. The decline in the fair value of the India Papers reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the India Papers operations.

Also in the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company  calculated the estimated fair value of its xpedx business using the discounted future cash flows and wrote off all of the goodwill of its xpedx business, totaling

$400 million

. The decline in fair value of the xpedx reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a significant decline in earnings and a change in the strategic outlook for the xpedx operations.

As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a total goodwill impairment charge of

$512 million

($485 million after taxes and a gain of $3 million related to noncontrolling interest), representing all of the recorded goodwill of the xpedx business and the India Papers business.

Also during 2013, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $15 million ($7 million after taxes and noncontrolling interest) for the impairment of a trade name intangible asset related to our India Papers business.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

The charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with International Paper’s consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates.

The calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities, the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates.

Benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of

December 31, 2015

, for International Paper’s pension and postretirement plans were as follows:

The table below shows assumptions used by  International Paper to calculate U.S. pension obligations for the years shown:

Additionally, health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of U.S. postretirement obligations for the years shown were:

International Paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio. The discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.

The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 7.75%.

Increasing (decreasing) the expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets by an additional

0.25%

would decrease (increase)


pension expense by



approximately

$27 million

, while a (decrease) increase of

0.25%

in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately

$36 million

. The effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a

1%

increase or decrease in the annual health care cost trend rate would be approximately

$1 million

.

Actual rates of return earned on U.S. pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were:

The 2012, 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of International Paper and Temple-Inland asset returns. International Paper and Temple-Inland assets were combined in October 2014. The annualized time-weighted rate of return earned on U.S. pension plan assets was

7.5%

and

7.0%

for the past five and ten years, respectively. The following graph shows the growth of a $1,000 investment in International Paper’s U.S. Pension Plan Master Trust. The graph portrays the time-weighted rate of return from 2005 – 2015.

ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. These net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years. The estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the U.S. pension plans over the next fiscal year are

$374 million

and

$41 million

, respectively.

Net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses, calculated for all of International Paper’s plans, were as follows:

The increase in


U.S. pension expense principally reflects a decrease in the discount rate, updated mortality assumptions, higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and a settlement charge in 2015.

Assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in


, projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows:

(1)

Based on assumptions at December 31, 2015.

The Company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately

$364 million

for its U.S. defined benefit plans in


, with the decrease from expense of

$461 million

in


reflecting an increase in the assumed discount rate to 4.40% in 2016 from 4.10% in 2015, updated demographic assumptions and lower unrecognized losses.

The market value of plan assets for International Paper’s U.S. qualified pension plan at

December 31, 2015

totaled approximately

$10.9 billion

, consisting of approximately

48%

equity securities,

33%

debt securities,

10%

real estate and

9%

other assets. Plan assets include an immaterial amount of International Paper common stock.

The Company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the Company,



and other factors. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future.  There are no required contributions to the U.S. qualified plan in 2016. The nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments, which totaled

$62 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has a Performance Share Plan, which grants performance-based restricted stock units that are paid out in stock when the awards are earned. Such incentive compensation plans are accounted for under ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation.” This standard requires that the value of shares to be issued under this plan be recognized as compensation over the period in which the awards are earned based on the fair value of the awards, and requires the use of a number of judgments and assumptions in determining the timing and amount of such charges. Additionally, since a component of these awards is based on the Company’s performance over a specified period compared to other companies, the amount of expense recorded for a given period could require adjustments after the end of the period.

Income Taxes

International Paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Where the Company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the Company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. Changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies.

While International Paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution

of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.

The Company’s effective income tax rates, before equity earnings and discontinued operations, were

37%

,

14%

and

(41)%

for


,


and


, respectively. These effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year, but may not recur in subsequent years. Management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years. Excluding these special items, the effective income tax rate for


was

33%

of pre-tax earnings compared with

31%

in


and

26%

in


. We estimate that the


effective income tax rate will be approximately 34% based on expected earnings and business conditions.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

There were no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year which have had or are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See

Note 2 Recent Accounting Developments

on pages 51 and 52 of

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Information concerning the Company’s environmental and legal proceedings is set forth in

Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies

on pages 61 through 64 of

Item  8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

.

EFFECT OF INFLATION

While inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as energy, wood fiber and chemical costs, have an impact on the Company’s operating results, changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years. Sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS

International Paper has operations in a number of countries. Its operations in those countries also export to, and compete with, imports from other regions. As such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s financial statements. Direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars and the remeasurement



impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities. Indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the United States (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). In general, a weaker U.S. dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to International Paper. The currencies that have the most impact are the Euro, the Brazilian real, the Polish zloty and the Russian ruble.

MARKET RISK

We use financial instruments, including fixed and variable rate debt, to finance operations, for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, financial instruments, including various derivative contracts, are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and foreign currency risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. Information related to International Paper’s debt obligations is included in

Note 13 Debt and Lines of Credit

on pages 66 and 67 of

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

. A discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in

Note 14 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

on pages 67 through 71 of

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

.

The fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments. We assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and currency rates and commodity prices.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short- and long-term debt obligations and investments in marketable securities. We invest in investment-grade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AAA and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund. Our investments in marketable securities at

December 31, 2015

and


are stated at cost, which approximates market due to their short-term nature. Our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material.

We issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with International Paper’s targeted capital structure, while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate. Derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, may be used to implement this capital structure. At

December 31, 2015

and


, the net fair

value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately

$9.3 billion

and

$9.8 billion

, respectively. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately

$565 million

and

$410 million

at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively.

Commodity Price Risk

The objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. Commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices. The net fair value of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at

December 31, 2015

and


was approximately a

$7 million

and a

$2 million

liability, respectively. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately

$1 million

at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively.

Foreign Currency Risk

International Paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries. Our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our after-tax cash flows. We address these risks on a limited basis by financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency, or by entering into cross-currency and interest rate swaps, or foreign exchange contracts. At

December 31, 2015

and


, the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a

$4 million

and a

$1 million

asset, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately

$30 million

and

$52 million

at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON:

Financial Statements

The management of International Paper Company is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in this annual report and for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America considered appropriate in the circumstances to present fairly the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows on a consistent basis. Management has also prepared the other information in this annual report and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

As can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment, some financial statement amounts are based on estimates and judgments. Even though estimates and judgments are used, measures have been taken to provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial information contained in this annual report. We have formed a Disclosure Committee to oversee this process.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP. During its audits, Deloitte & Touche LLP was given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of stockholders and the board of directors and all committees of the board. Management believes that all representations made to the independent auditors during their audits were valid and appropriate.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of International Paper Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes. All internal control systems have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control objectives. The Company’s internal control

system is supported by written policies and procedures, contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and is audited by the internal audit function. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

The Company has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

. In making this assessment, it used the criteria described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of

December 31, 2015

, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The report appears on pages 42 and 43.

Internal Control Environment And Board Of Directors Oversight

Our internal control environment includes an enterprise-wide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top.” This is exemplified by our ethics program that includes long-standing principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of International Paper business, which have been distributed to all employees; a toll-free telephone helpline whereby any employee may anonymously report suspected violations of law or International Paper’s policy; and an office of ethics and business practice. The internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel, appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility, dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout International Paper, and an extensive program of internal audits with management follow-up.

REPORT OF  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of International Paper Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of International Paper Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of International Paper Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's

internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of International Paper Company:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of International Paper Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with



generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF BUSINESS

International Paper (the Company) is a global paper and packaging company with primary markets and manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Russia, Asia,  Africa and the Middle East. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to available industry capacity and general economic conditions.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require the use of management’s estimates. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates.

On July 1, 2014, International Paper completed the spinoff of its distribution business, xpedx, and xpedx's merger with Unisource Worldwide, Inc., with the combined companies now operating as Veritiv Corporation (Veritiv). As a result of the spinoff, all prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect xpedx as a discontinued operation. See

Note 7

for further discussion.

CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International Paper and its wholly-owned, controlled majority-owned and financially controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.

Investments in affiliated companies where the Company has significant influence over their operations are accounted for by the equity method. International Paper’s share of affiliates’ results of operations totaled earnings (loss) of

$117 million

,

$(200) million

and

$(39) million

in


,


and


, respectively.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue is recognized when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated f.o.b. (free on board) shipping point. For sales transactions designated f.o.b. destination, revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer’s delivery site, when title and risk of loss are transferred. Timber and forestland sales revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the buyer.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

Shipping and handling costs, such as freight to our customers’ destinations, are included in distribution expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. When shipping and handling costs are included in the sales price charged for our products, they are recognized in net sales.

ANNUAL MAINTENANCE COSTS

Costs for repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the month that the related activity is performed under the direct expense method of accounting.

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS

Temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less are treated as cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which approximates market value.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. In the United States, costs of raw materials and finished pulp and paper products, are generally determined using the last-in, first-out method. Other inventories are valued using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods.

PLANTS, PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT

Plants, properties and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for betterments are capitalized, whereas normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The units-of-production method of depreciation is used for pulp and paper mills, and the straight-line method is used for other plants and equipment. Annual straight-line depreciation rates generally are, for buildings —

2.50%

to

5.00%

, and for machinery and equipment —

5%

to

33%

.

FORESTLANDS

At

December 31, 2015

, International Paper and its subsidiaries owned or managed approximately

335,000

acres of forestlands in Brazil, and through licenses and forest management agreements, had harvesting rights on government-owned forestlands in Russia. Costs attributable to timber are expensed as trees are cut. The rate charged is determined annually based on the relationship of incurred costs to estimated current merchantable volume.



GOODWILL

Goodwill relating to a single business reporting unit is included as an asset of the applicable segment. For goodwill impairment testing, this goodwill is allocated to reporting units. Annual testing for possible goodwill impairment is performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, with additional interim testing performed when management believes that it is more likely than not events or circumstances have occurred that would result in the impairment of a reporting unit’s goodwill.

In performing this testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets, discounted using the estimated cost of capital for each reporting unit. These estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to historic market transactions for businesses in the industry, and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the Company’s traded stock price on the testing date. For reporting units whose recorded value of net assets plus goodwill is in excess of their estimated fair values, the fair values of the individual assets and liabilities of the respective reporting units are then determined to calculate the amount of any goodwill impairment charge required. See

Note 9

for further discussion.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, measured by comparing their net book value to the undiscounted projected future cash flows generated by their use. Impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value.

INCOME TAXES

International Paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate changes are enacted.

International Paper records its worldwide tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Where the

Company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the Company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and the facts of each matter. Changes to recorded liabilities are made only when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, a change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter.

While the judgments and estimates made by the Company are based on management’s evaluation of the technical merits of a matter, assisted as necessary by consultation with outside consultants, historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts, resulting in charges or credits that could materially affect future financial statements.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Compensation costs resulting from all stock-based compensation transactions are measured and recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award.

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS

Costs associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value when the amount and timing of expected cash payments are reliably determinable.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

A liability and an asset are recorded equal to the present value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of long-lived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The liability is accreted over time and the asset is depreciated over the life of the related equipment or facility. International Paper’s asset retirement obligations principally relate to closure costs for landfills. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated costs or timing of closures, or possible new federal or state regulations affecting these closures.



In connection with potential future closures or redesigns of certain production facilities, it is possible that the Company may be required to take steps to remove certain materials from these facilities. Applicable regulations and standards provide that the removal of certain materials would only be required if the facility were to be demolished or underwent major renovations. At this time, any such obligations have an indeterminate settlement date, and the Company believes that adequate information does not exist to apply an expected-present-value technique to estimate any such potential obligations. Accordingly, the Company does not record a liability for such remediation until a decision is made that allows reasonable estimation of the timing of such remediation.

TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Balance sheets of international operations are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, while statements of operations are translated at average rates. Adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as cumulative translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

NOTE 2 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Other than as described below, no new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

CLASSIFICATION OF DEFERRED TAXES

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, "Balance Classification of Deferred Taxes." This ASU requires entities to offset all deferred tax assets and liabilities (and valuation allowances) for each tax-paying jurisdiction within each tax-paying component. The net deferred tax must be presented as a single noncurrent amount. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The application of the requirements of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Business Combinations - Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments." This ASU provides that an acquirer must recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The ASU also requires acquirers to present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, the

portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized at the acquisition date. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. This ASU must be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance.

INVENTORY

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory." This ASU provides that entities should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measure using LIFO or the retail inventory method. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance.

CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENTS

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, "Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement." This ASU provides clarification on whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a software license is included, the customer should account for the license consistent with its accounting of other software licenses. If a software license is not included, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The application of the requirements of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs)," which simplifies the balance sheet presentation of the costs for issuing debt. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years; however, early adoption is allowed. An entity should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be



adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. The application of the requirements of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

CONSOLIDATION

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, "Consolidation," which amends the requirements for consolidation and significantly changes the consolidation analysis required. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. The application of the requirements of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, "Accounting for Share-based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That Performance Target Could Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period." This guidance provides that entities should treat performance targets that can be met after the requisite service period of a share-based payment award as performance conditions that affect vesting. As such, an entity should not record compensation expense related to an award for which transfer to the employee is contingent on the entity's satisfaction of a performance target until it becomes probable that the performance target will be met. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. The application of the requirements of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers."  The guidance replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance and provides that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance.

NOTE 3 EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed assuming that all potentially dilutive securities, including “in-the-money” stock options, were converted into common shares.

A reconciliation of the amounts included in the computation of basic earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, and diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations is as follows:

(a)

Securities are not included in the table in periods when antidilutive.

(b)

Options to purchase shares were not included in the computation of diluted common shares outstanding if their exercise price exceeded the average market price of the Company’s common stock for each respective reporting date.

ALTERNATIVE FUEL MIXTURE TAX CREDIT

On July 19, 2011 the Company filed an amended 2009 tax return claiming alternative fuel mixture tax credits as non-taxable income. The amended position has been accepted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the closing of the IRS tax audit for the years 2006 - 2009. As a result, during 2013, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of

$753 million

related to the non-taxability of the alternative fuel mixture tax credits.



NOTE 6 ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES

OLMUKSAN

2014:

In May 2014, the Company conducted a voluntary tender offer for the remaining outstanding

12.6%

public shares of Olmuksan. The Company also purchased outstanding shares of Olmuksan outside of the tender offer. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company owned

91.7%

of Olmuksan's outstanding and issued shares.

2013:

On January 3, 2013, International Paper completed the acquisition (effective date of acquisition on January 1, 2013)  of the shares of its joint venture partner, Sabanci Holding, in the Turkish corrugated packaging company, Olmuksa International Paper Sabanci Ambalaj Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., now called Olmuksan International Paper Ambalaj Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. (Olmuksan), for a purchase price of

$56 million

. The acquired shares represented

43.7%

of Olmuksan's shares. Prior to this acquisition, International Paper held a

43.7%

equity interest in Olmuksan.

Because the transaction resulted in International Paper becoming the majority shareholder, owning

87.4%

of Olmuksan's outstanding and issued shares, its completion triggered a mandatory call for tender of the remaining public shares which began in March 2013 and ended in April 2013, with no shares tendered.  As a result, the

12.6%

owned by other parties were considered non-controlling interests.  Olmuksan's financial results have been consolidated with the Company's Industrial Packaging segment beginning January 1, 2013, the effective date which International Paper obtained majority control of the entity.

Following the transaction, the Company's previously held

43.7%

equity interest in Olmuksan was remeasured to a fair value of

$75 million

, resulting in a gain of

$9 million

. In addition, the cumulative translation adjustment balance of

$17 million

relating to the previously held equity interest was reclassified, as expense, from accumulated other comprehensive income.

The final purchase price allocation indicated that the sum of the cash consideration paid, the fair value of the noncontrolling interest and the fair value of the previously held interest was less than the fair value of the underlying assets by

$21 million

, resulting in a bargain purchase price gain being recorded on this transaction. The aforementioned remeasurement of equity interest gain, the cumulative translation adjustment to expense, and the bargain purchase gain are included in the Net bargain purchase gain on acquisition of business in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

The following table summarizes the final allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as of January 1, 2013, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Pro forma information related to the acquisition of Olmuksan has not been included as it does not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations.

ORSA

2014:

On April 8, 2014, the Company acquired the remaining

25%

of shares of Orsa International Paper Embalangens S.A. (Orsa IP) from its joint venture partner, Jari Celulose, Papel e Embalagens S.A. (Jari), a Grupo Orsa company, for approximately

$127 million

, of which

$105 million

was paid in cash with the remaining

$22 million

held back pending satisfaction of certain indemnification obligations by Jari. International Paper will  release the amount held back, or any amount for which we have not notified Jari of a claim, by March 30, 2016. An additional

$11 million

, which was not included in the purchase price, was placed in an escrow account pending resolution of certain open matters. During 2014, these open matters were successfully resolved, which resulted in

$9 million

paid out of escrow to Jari and correspondingly added to the final purchase consideration. The remaining

$2 million

was released back to the Company.  As a result of this transaction, the Company reversed the

$168 million

of Redeemable noncontrolling interest included on the March 31, 2014 consolidated balance sheet. The net difference between the Redeemable noncontrolling interest balance plus

$14 million

of currency translation adjustment reclassified out of Other comprehensive income less the

25%

purchase price was reflected as an increase to Retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet.



2013:

On January 14, 2013, International Paper and Jari formed Orsa IP with International Paper holding a

75%

stake. The value of International Paper's investment in Orsa IP was approximately

$471 million

. Because International Paper acquired a majority control of the joint venture, Orsa IP's financial results have been consolidated with our Industrial Packaging segment from the date of formation on January 14, 2013.  The

25%

owned by Jari was considered a redeemable noncontrolling interest and met the requirements to be classified outside permanent equity. As such, the Company reported

$163 million

in Redeemable noncontrolling interest in the December 31, 2013 consolidated balance sheet.

The following table summarizes the final allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as of January 14, 2013, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2013.

The identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the Orsa IP acquisition included the following:

Pro forma information related to the acquisition of Orsa IP has not been included as it does not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations.

Due to the complex organizational structure of Orsa IP's operations, and the extended time required to prepare consolidated financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United

States, the Company reports Orsa IP's operating results on a one-month lag basis.

NOTE 7 DIVESTITURES / SPINOFF

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

2014:

On July 1, 2014, International Paper completed the spinoff of its distribution business, xpedx, which subsequently merged with Unisource Worldwide, Inc., with the combined companies now operating as Veritiv Corporation (Veritiv). The xpedx business had historically represented the Company's Distribution reportable segment.

The spinoff was accomplished by the contribution of the xpedx business to Veritiv and the distribution of

8,160,000

shares of Veritiv common stock on a pro-rata basis to International Paper shareholders.  International Paper received a payment of approximately

$411 million

, financed with new debt in Veritiv's capital structure.

All current and historical operating results for xpedx are included in Discontinued operations, net of tax, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The following summarizes the major classes of line items comprising Earnings (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Equity Earnings reconciled to Discontinued Operations, net of tax, related to the xpedx spinoff for all periods presented in the consolidated statement of operations:

(a)   These amounts, along with those disclosed below related to the Temple-Inland Building Products divestitures, are included in Discontinued operations, net of tax, in the consolidated statement of operations.

Total cash provided by operations related to xpedx of

$29 million

and

$81 million

for 2014 and 2013, respectively, is included in Cash Provided By (Used For) Operations in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Total cash provided by (used for) investing activities related to xpedx of

$3 million

and

$12 million

for 2014



and 2013, respectively, is included in Cash Provided By (Used For) Investing Activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

2013:

On April 1, 2013, the Company finalized the sale of Temple-Inland's

50%

interest in Del-Tin Fiber L.L.C. to joint venture partner Deltic Timber Corporation for

$20 million

in assumed liabilities and cash.

On July 19, 2013 the Company finalized the sale of its Temple-Inland Building Products division to Georgia-Pacific Building Products, LLC for approximately

$726 million

in cash.

Related to these divestitures, the Company recorded income (loss) of

$0 million

,

$(12) million

and

$45 million

for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These amounts are included in Discontinued operations, net of tax in the consolidated statement of operations.

OTHER DIVESTITURES AND IMPAIRMENTS

2015:

On October 13, 2015

,

the Company finalized the sale of its

55%

interest in IP Asia Coated Paperboard (IP-Sun JV) business, within the Company's Consumer Packaging segment, to its Chinese coated board joint venture partner, Shandong Sun Holding Group Co., Ltd. for RMB

149 million

(approximately USD

$23 million

). During the third quarter of 2015, a determination was made that the current book value of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value of

$23 million

, which was the agreed upon selling price. The 2015 loss includes the net pre-tax impairment charge of

$174 million

(

$113 million

after taxes). A pre-tax charge of

$186 million

was recorded during the third quarter in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment to write down the long-lived assets of this business to their estimated fair value.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, upon the sale and corresponding deconsolidation of IP-Sun JV from the Company's consolidated balance sheet, final  adjustments were made resulting in a reduction of the impairment of

$12 million

. The amount of pre-tax losses related to noncontrolling interest of the IP-Sun JV included in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were

$19 million

,

$12 million

and

$8 million

, respectively. The amount of pre-tax losses related to the IP-Sun JV included in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were

$226 million

,

$51 million

and

$41 million

, respectively.

The net 2015 loss totaling

$174 million

related to the impairment of Sun-JV is included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

2014:

During 2014, the Company recorded a net pre-tax charge of

$47 million

(

$36 million

after taxes) for the loss on the sale of a business by our equity method investee,  ASG (formerly referred to as AGI-Shorewood), and the subsequent partial impairment of this ASG investment.

The net  2014 loss totaling

$38 million

, including the ASG impairment discussed above, related to other divestitures and impairments is included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

2013:

During 2013, the Company recorded net pre-tax charges of

$3 million

(

$1 million

after taxes) for adjustments related to the divestiture of

three

containerboard mills in 2012 and the sale of the Shorewood business. This loss is included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

NOTE 8 SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE

Accounts and notes receivable, net of allowances, by classification were:

INVENTORIES

The last-in, first-out inventory method is used to value most of International Paper’s U.S. inventories. Approximately

78%

of total raw materials and finished products inventories were valued using this method. If the first-in, first-out method had been used, it would have increased total inventory balances by approximately

$345 million

and

$334 million

at December 31,


and


, respectively.



PLANTS, PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT

INTEREST

Cash payments related to interest were as follows:

Amounts related to interest were as follows:

(a)

Interest expense and interest income exclude approximately

$25 million

,

$38 million

and

$45 million

in


,


and


, respectively, related to investments in and borrowings from variable interest entities for which the Company has a legal right of offset (see

Note 12

).

NOTE 9 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

GOODWILL

The following tables present changes in the goodwill balances as allocated to each business segment for the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


:

(a)

Represents accumulated goodwill impairment charges since the adoption of ASC 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other” in 2002.

(b)

Represents the effects of foreign currency translations and reclassifications.

(c)

Reflects a reduction from tax benefits generated by the deduction of goodwill amortization for tax purposes in Brazil.

(d)

Reduction due to the sale and de-consolidation of Shandong Sun joint venture in Asia.

(e)

Reflects a charge for goodwill impairment related to our Brazil Industrial Packaging business.

(a)

Represents accumulated goodwill impairment charges since the adoption of ASC 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other” in 2002.

(b)

Represents the effects of foreign currency translations and reclassifications.

(c)

Reflects a reduction from tax benefits generated by the deduction of goodwill amortization for tax purposes in Brazil.

(d)

Reflects a charge of

$100 million

for goodwill impairment related to our Asia Industrial Packaging business.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the Company calculated the estimated fair value of its Brazil Packaging business using its discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in the business, totaling

$137 million

, should be written off. The decline in the fair value of the Brazil Packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to the negative impacts on the cash flows of the business caused by the continued decline of the overall Brazilian economy.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the Company calculated the estimated fair value of its Asia Industrial Packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in this business, totaling

$100 million

, should be written off. The decline in the fair value of the Asia Industrial Packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the business.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the Company calculated the estimated fair value of its India Papers business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill of this business, totaling

$112 million

, should be written off. The decline in the fair value of the India Papers reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the India Papers operations.

At December 31, 2013, there was

$400 million

of goodwill and

$400 million

of accumulated impairment losses included in the consolidated balance sheet associated with



the xpedx business (Distribution segment). Effective July 1, 2014, the Company completed the spinoff of its xpedx business which had historically represented the Company's Distribution reportable segment. Following the spinoff of xpedx, the assets and liabilities of this business have been adjusted off of the consolidated balance sheet and are not included in balances as of December 31, 2014.

OTHER INTANGIBLES

Identifiable intangible assets comprised the following:

The Company recognized the following amounts as amortization expense related to intangible assets:

Based on current intangibles subject to amortization, estimated amortization expense for each of the succeeding years is as follows:


–

$46 million

,


–

$44 million

,


–

$35 million

,


–

$33 million

,


–

$32 million

, and cumulatively thereafter –

$199 million

.

NOTE 10 INCOME TAXES

The components of International Paper’s earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings by taxing jurisdiction were as follows:

The provision (benefit) for income taxes (excluding noncontrolling interests) by taxing jurisdiction was as follows:

The Company’s deferred income tax provision (benefit) includes a

$3 million

provision, a

$13 million

benefit and a

$7 million

provision for


,


and


, respectively, for the effect of changes in non-U.S. and U.S. state tax rates.

International Paper made income tax payments, net of refunds, of

$149 million

,

$172 million

and

$291 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

A reconciliation of income tax expense using the statutory U.S. income tax rate compared with the actual income tax provision follows:



The tax effects of significant temporary differences, representing deferred income tax assets and liabilities at

December 31, 2015

and


, were as follows:

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under the captions Deferred income tax assets, Deferred charges and other assets, Other accrued liabilities, and Deferred income taxes.  There is a decrease in deferred income tax assets principally relating to the tax impact of changes in qualified pension liabilities and the utilization of tax credits. Deferred tax liabilities decreased primarily due to a reduction in the intangibles deferred tax liability. Of the

$2.3 billion

forestlands,  related installment sales, and investment in subsidiary deferred tax liability,

$1.4 billion

is attributable to an investment in subsidiary and relates to a 2006 International Paper installment sale of forestlands and

$840 million

is attributable to a 2007 Temple-Inland installment sale of forestlands (see

Note 12

).  Certain tax attributes reflected on our tax returns as filed differ from those reflected in the deferred income tax accounts due to uncertain tax benefits.

The valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets as of

December 31, 2015

,


and


was

$430 million

,

$415 million

and

$413 million

, respectively. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


was an increase of

$15 million

and an increase of

$2 million

, respectively.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


is as follows:

Included in the balance at

December 31, 2015

,


and


are

$1 million

,

$1 million

and

$1 million

, respectively, for tax positions for which the ultimate benefits are highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such benefits. However, except for the possible effect of any penalties, any disallowance that would change the timing of these benefits would not affect the annual effective tax rate, but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.

The Company accrues interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The Company had approximately

$34 million

and

$41 million

accrued for the payment of estimated interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively.

The major jurisdictions where the Company files income tax returns are the United States, Brazil, France, Poland and Russia. Generally, tax years 2003 through 2014 remain open and subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. The Company is typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time, both in the United States and overseas. In 2013, the Company concluded its examination with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the tax years 2006 through 2009 for both International Paper Company and Temple-Inland. As a result of the completion of the examinations, the Company reduced its unrecognized tax benefits by approximately

$844 million

. Other pending audit settlements and the expiration of statute of limitations could further reduce the uncertain tax positions by

$39 million

during the next twelve months. While the Company believes that it is adequately accrued for possible audit adjustments, the final resolution of these examinations cannot be determined at this time and could result in final settlements that differ from current estimates.



Included in the Company’s


,


and


income tax provision (benefit) are

$(121) million

,

$(453) million

and

$(869) million

, respectively, related to special items. The components of the net provisions related to special items were as follows:

Excluding the impact of special items and nonoperating pension expense, the


,


and


income tax provisions were

$687 million

,

$659 million

and

$497 million

, respectively, or

33%

,

31%

and

26%

, respectively, of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.

The following details the scheduled expiration dates of the Company’s net operating loss and income tax credit carryforwards:

Deferred income taxes are not provided for temporary differences of approximately

$5.7 billion

,

$5.2 billion

and

$5.1 billion

as of

December 31, 2015

,


and


, respectively, representing earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries intended to be permanently reinvested. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and other basis differences is not practicable.

The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the “Act”) was signed into law on January 2, 2013. The Act retroactively restored several expired business tax provisions, including the research and experimentation credit and the Subpart F controlled foreign corporation look-through exception. Because a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment, the retroactive effect of the Act on the Company's U.S.

federal taxes for 2012 of a benefit of approximately

$32 million

was recognized in the first quarter of 2013.

NOTE 11 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND OPERATING LEASES

Certain property, machinery and equipment are leased under cancelable and non-cancelable agreements.

Unconditional purchase obligations have been entered into in the ordinary course of business, principally for capital projects and the purchase of certain pulpwood, logs, wood chips, raw materials, energy and services, including fiber supply agreements to purchase pulpwood that were entered into concurrently with the Company’s 2006 Transformation Plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of Weyerhaeuser Company’s Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business.

At

December 31, 2015

, total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operating leases and purchase obligations were as follows:

(a)

Includes

$2.1 billion

relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the Company’s 2006 Transformation Plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of Weyerhaeuser Company’s Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business.

Rent expense was

$170 million

,

$154 million

and

$168 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

GUARANTEES

In connection with sales of businesses, property, equipment, forestlands and other assets, International Paper commonly makes representations and warranties relating to such businesses or assets, and may agree to indemnify buyers with respect to tax and environmental liabilities, breaches of representations and warranties, and other matters. Where liabilities for such matters are determined to be probable and subject to reasonable estimation, accrued liabilities are recorded at the time of sale as a cost of the transaction.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

CERCLA and State Actions

International Paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws, including the



Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Many of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources. While joint and several liability is authorized under CERCLA and equivalent state laws, as a practical matter, liability for CERCLA cleanups is typically allocated among the many potential responsible parties. Remediation costs are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become probable and reasonably estimable. International Paper has estimated the probable liability associated with these matters to be approximately

$93 million

in the aggregate as of December 31,


.

Cass Lake:

One of the matters included above arises out of a closed wood treating facility located in Cass Lake, Minnesota. During 2009, in connection with an environmental site remediation action under CERCLA, International Paper submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a remediation feasibility study. In June 2011, the EPA selected and published a proposed soil remedy at the site with an estimated cost of

$46 million

. The overall remediation reserve for the site is currently

$47 million

to address the selection of an alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy. In October 2011, the EPA released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy decision would be delayed. In the unlikely event that the EPA changes its proposed soil remedy and approves instead a more expensive clean-up alternative, the remediation costs could be material, and significantly higher than amounts currently recorded. In October 2012, the Natural Resource Trustees for this site provided notice to International Paper and other potentially responsible parties of their intent to perform a Natural Resource Damage Assessment. It is premature to predict the outcome of the assessment or to estimate a loss or range of loss, if any, which may be incurred.

Other Remediation Costs

In addition to the above matters, other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the Company’s current, closed or formerly-owned facilities, and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet, totaled approximately

$46 million

as of

December 31, 2015

. Other than as described above, completion of required remedial actions is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Environmental

Kalamazoo River:

The Company is a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to the Allied Paper, Inc./Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River Superfund Site in Michigan. The EPA asserts that the site is contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) primarily as a

result of discharges from various paper mills located along the Kalamazoo River, including a paper mill formerly owned by St. Regis Paper Company (St. Regis). The Company is a successor in interest to St. Regis. Although the Company has not received any orders from the EPA, in December 2014, the EPA sent the Company a letter demanding payment of

$19 million

to reimburse the EPA for costs associated with a Time Critical Removal Action of PCB contaminated sediments from a portion of the site. The Company’s CERCLA liability has not been finally determined with respect to this or any other portion of the site and we have declined to reimburse the EPA at this time. As noted below, the Company is involved in allocation/apportionment litigation with regard to the site. Accordingly, it is premature to predict the outcome or estimate our maximum reasonably possible loss with respect to this site. However, we do not believe that any material loss is probable.

The Company was named as a defendant by Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP, Fort James Corporation and Georgia Pacific LLC in a contribution and cost recovery action for alleged pollution at the site. The suit seeks contribution under CERCLA for costs purportedly expended by plaintiffs (

$79 million

as of the filing of the complaint) and for future remediation costs. The suit alleges that a mill, during the time it was allegedly owned and operated by St. Regis, discharged PCB contaminated solids and paper residuals resulting from paper de-inking and recycling. NCR Corporation and Weyerhaeuser Company are also named as defendants in the suit. In mid-2011, the suit was transferred from the District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin to the District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The trial of the initial liability phase took place in February 2013. Weyerhaeuser conceded prior to trial that it was a liable party with respect to the site. In September 2013, an opinion and order was issued in the suit. The order concluded that the Company (as the successor to St. Regis) was not an “operator,” but was an “owner,” of the mill at issue during a portion of the relevant period and is therefore liable under CERCLA. The order also determined that NCR is a liable party as an "arranger for disposal" of PCBs in waste paper that was de-inked and recycled by mills along the Kalamazoo River. The order did not address the Company's responsibility, if any, for past or future costs, which is the subject of a separate trial, in which trial testimony was given between September and December 2015 and post-trial briefing is currently scheduled to be completed in March 2016.  The Court has not yet ruled to what extent it will decide responsibility for future costs. We are unable to predict the outcome or estimate our maximum reasonably possible loss. However, we do not believe that any material loss is probable.

Harris County:

International Paper and McGinnis Industrial Maintenance Corporation, a subsidiary of



Waste Management, Inc., are PRPs at the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund Site (San Jacinto River Superfund Site) in Harris County, Texas, and have been actively participating in investigation and remediation activities at this Superfund Site. In December 2011, Harris County, Texas filed a suit against the Company seeking civil penalties with regard to the alleged discharge of dioxin into the San Jacinto River from waste impoundments that are part of the San Jacinto River Superfund Site. In November 2014, International Paper secured a zero liability jury verdict. Harris County appealed the verdict in April 2015, and that appeal is pending. The Company is also defending an additional lawsuit related to the San Jacinto River Superfund Site brought by approximately


individuals who allege property damage and personal injury. Because this case is still in the discovery phase, it is premature to predict the outcome or to estimate a loss or range of loss, if any, which may be incurred.

Antitrust

Containerboard:

In September 2010,

eight

containerboard producers, including International Paper and Temple-Inland, were named as defendants in a purported class action complaint that alleged a civil violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The suit is captioned

Kleen Products LLC v. International Paper Co. (N.D. Ill.)

. The complaint alleges that the defendants, beginning in February 2004 through November 2010, conspired to limit the supply and thereby increase prices of containerboard products. The class is all persons who purchased containerboard products directly from any defendant for use or delivery in the United States during the period February 2004 to November 2010. The complaint seeks to recover an unspecified amount of treble actual damages and attorneys' fees on behalf of the purported class.

Four

similar complaints were filed and have been consolidated in the Northern District of Illinois. In March 2015, the District Court certified a class of direct purchasers of containerboard products; in June 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted the defendants' petition to appeal and the class certification issue is now pending in that court. In June 2015, International Paper and Temple-Inland were named as defendants in a lawsuit captioned Del Monte Fresh Products N.A., Inc. v. Packaging Corporation of America (S.K. Fl.), in which the Plaintiff asserts substantially similar allegations to those raised in the Kleen Products LLC action. Pursuant to a tolling agreement signed by all parties, the case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice in November 2015.  Moreover, in January 2011, International Paper was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in state court in Cocke County, Tennessee alleging that International Paper violated Tennessee law by conspiring to limit the supply and fix the prices of containerboard from mid-2005 to the present. Plaintiffs in the state court action seek certification of a class of

Tennessee indirect purchasers of containerboard products, damages and costs, including attorneys' fees. No class certification materials have been filed to date in the Tennessee action. The Company disputes the allegations made and is vigorously defending each action. However, because the Kleen Products LLC action is in the discovery stage and the Tennessee action is in a preliminary stage, we are unable to predict an outcome or estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.

Gypsum:

Beginning in late December 2012, certain purchasers of gypsum board filed a number of purported class action complaints alleging civil violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act against Temple-Inland and a number of other gypsum manufacturers. The complaints were similar and alleged that the gypsum manufacturers conspired or otherwise reached agreements to: (1) raise prices of gypsum board either from 2008 or 2011 through the present; (2) avoid price erosion by ceasing the practice of issuing job quotes; and (3) restrict supply through downtime and limiting order fulfillment.  On April 8, 2013, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered transfer of all pending cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings, and the direct purchaser plaintiffs and indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed their respective amended consolidated complaints in June 2013. The amended consolidated complaints alleged a conspiracy or agreement beginning on or before September 2011. The alleged classes were all persons who purchased gypsum board directly or indirectly from any defendant. The complainants seek to recover unspecified treble actual damages and attorneys' fees on behalf of the purported classes. In February 2015, we executed a definitive agreement to settle these cases for an immaterial amount, and this settlement received final court approval and was paid in the third quarter of 2015.

In March 2015, several homebuilders filed an antitrust action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that they purchased gypsum board and making similar allegations to those contained in the above settled proceeding. That lawsuit was transferred by the Judicial  Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The homebuilders filed a notice to opt out of the class settlements and recently amended their complaint to assert that the alleged conspiracy or conspiracies continued into 2015. The Company intends to dispute the allegations made and to vigorously defend that lawsuit.

In addition, in September 2013, similar purported class actions were filed in courts in Quebec, Canada and Ontario, Canada, with each suit alleging violations of the Canadian Competition Act and seeking damages and injunctive relief. In April 2015, a similar class action



was filed in British Columbia, Canada. In May 2015, we reached an agreement in principle to settle these Canadian cases for an immaterial amount. In November 2015, a definitive settlement agreement was executed and is subject to court approval.

Tax

On October 16, 2015, the Company was notified of a

$92 million

tax assessment issued by the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil for tax years 2011 through 2013. The assessment pertains to invoices issued by the Company related to the sale of paper to the editorial segment, which is exempt from the payment of ICMS value-added tax.  This assessment is in the preliminary stage. The Company does not believe that a material loss is probable.

General

The Company is involved in various other inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation relating to environmental and safety matters, labor and employment, contracts, sales of property, intellectual property, personal injury and other matters, some of which allege substantial monetary damages. While any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty, the Company believes that the outcome of any of these lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened or all of them combined (other than those that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature) will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 12 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

In connection with the 2006 sale of approximately

5.6 million

acres of forestlands, International Paper received installment notes (the Timber Notes) totaling approximately

$4.8 billion

. The Timber Notes, which do not require principal payments prior to their maturity which was originally

August 2016

, are supported by irrevocable letters of credit obtained by the buyers of the forestlands.

During 2006, International Paper contributed the Timber Notes to newly formed special purpose entities (the Borrower Entities) in exchange for Class A and Class B interests in these entities. Subsequently, International Paper contributed its

$200 million

Class A interests in the Borrower Entities, along with approximately

$400 million

of International Paper promissory notes, to other newly formed special purpose entities (the Investor Entities, and together with the Borrower Entities, the Entities) in exchange for Class A and Class B interests in these entities, and simultaneously sold its Class A interest in the Investor Entities to a third party investor. As a result, at December 31, 2006, International Paper held Class B

interests in the Borrower Entities and Class B interests in the Investor Entities valued at approximately

$5.0 billion

. International Paper did not provide any financial support that was not previously contractually required for the years ended December 31, 2015,


, or


.

Following the 2006 sale of forestlands and creation of the Entities discussed above, the Timber Notes were used as collateral for borrowings from third party lenders, which effectively monetized the Timber Notes.

Also during 2006, the Entities acquired approximately

$4.8 billion

of International Paper debt obligations for cash, resulting in a total of approximately

$5.2 billion

of International Paper debt obligations held by the Entities at December 31, 2006. The various agreements entered into in connection with these transactions provided that International Paper had, and intended to effect, a legal right to offset its obligation under these debt instruments with its investments in the Entities. Accordingly, for financial reporting purposes, International Paper had offset approximately

$5.2 billion

of Class B interests in the Entities against

$5.3 billion

of International Paper debt obligations held by these Entities at December 31,


, and despite the offset treatment, these remained debt obligations of International Paper. Remaining borrowings of

$50 million

are included in Long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31,


. Additional debt related to the above transaction of

$107 million

is included in Notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt at December 31,


.

The use of the Entities facilitated the monetization of the credit enhanced Timber Notes in a cost effective manner by increasing borrowing capacity and lowering the interest rate, while providing for the offset accounting treatment described above. Additionally, the monetization structure preserved the

$1.4 billion

tax deferral that resulted from the 2006 forestlands sales.

Based on an analysis of the Entities under ASC 810, "Consolidation," that considers the potential magnitude of the variability in the structures and which party has a controlling financial interest, International Paper determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of the Entities at December 31, 2014, and therefore, did not consolidate its investments in the Entities. The Company also determined that the source of variability in the structures is the value of the Timber Notes, the assets most significantly impacting the structures' economic performance. The credit quality of the Timber Notes is supported by irrevocable letters of credit obtained by the Timber Note issuers. International Paper analyzed which party had control over the economic performance of each Entity, and concluded International Paper did not have control over significant decisions surrounding the Timber Notes and letters of



credit and therefore was not the primary beneficiary at December 31, 2014. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2014 equaled the principal amount of the Timber Notes; however, an analysis performed by the Company concluded the likelihood of this exposure was remote.

During the third quarter of 2015, we initiated a series of actions in order to extend the 2006 monetization structure and maintain the long-term nature of the

$1.4 billion

deferred tax liability. First, International Paper acquired the Class A interests in the Investor Entities from a third party for

$198 million

in cash. As a result, International Paper became the owner of all of the Class A and Class B interests in the Entities and became the primary beneficiary of the Entities. The assets and liabilities of the Entities, primarily consisting of the Timber Notes and third party bank loans, were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date of the Class A interests.

Subsequent to purchasing the Class A interests in the Investor Entities, International Paper restructured the Entities, which resulted in the formation of wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities (the 2015 Financing Entities). As part of the restructuring, the Timber Notes held by the Borrower Entities, subject to the third party bank loans, were contributed to the 2015 Financing Entities along with approximately

$150 million

in International Paper debt obligations, approximately

$600 million

in cash and approximately

$130 million

in demand loans from International Paper, and certain Entities were liquidated. As a result of these transactions, International Paper began consolidating the 2015 Financing Entities during the third quarter of 2015.  Also, during the third quarter of 2015, the 2015 Financing Entities used

$630 million

in cash to pay down a portion of the third party bank loans and refinanced approximately

$4.2 billion

of those loans on nonrecourse terms (the 2015 Refinance Loans).

During the fourth quarter of 2015, International Paper extended the maturity date on the Timber Notes for an additional five years.  The Timber Notes are shown in Financial assets of special purpose entities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and mature in

August 2021

unless extended for an additional five years.  These notes are supported by approximately

$4.8 billion

of irrevocable letters of credit.  In addition, the Company extinguished the 2015 Refinance Loans  scheduled to mature in

May 2016

and entered into new nonrecourse third party bank loans totaling approximately

$4.2 billion

(the Extension Loans).  Provisions of loan agreements related to approximately

$1.1 billion

of the Extension Loans require the bank issuing letters of credit supporting the Timber Notes pledged as collateral to maintain a credit rating at or above a specified threshold.  In the event the credit

rating of the letter of credit bank is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of credit must be replaced within

60 days

with letters of credit from a qualifying financial institution.  The Extension Loans are shown in Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and mature in the fourth quarter of


.  The extinguishment of the 2015 Refinance Loans of approximately

$4.2 billion

and the issuance of the Extension Loans of approximately

$4.2 billion

are shown as part of reductions of debt and issuances of debt, respectively, in the financing activities of the consolidated statement of cash flows.

The Extension Loans are nonrecourse to the Company, and are secured by approximately

$4.8 billion

of Timber Notes, the irrevocable letters of credit supporting the Timber Notes and approximately

$150 million

of International Paper debt obligations. The

$150 million

of International Paper debt obligations are eliminated in the consolidation of the 2015 Financing Entities and are not reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

The purchase of the Class A interests and subsequent restructuring described above facilitated the refinancing and extensions of the third party bank loans on nonrecourse terms. The transactions described in these paragraphs result in continued long-term classification of the

$1.4 billion

deferred tax liability recognized in connection with the 2006 forestlands sale.

As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of the Timber Notes and Extension Loans is

$4.68 billion

and

$4.28 billion

, respectively. The Timber Notes and Extension Loans are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in Note 14.

Activity between the Company and the 2015 Financing Entities (the Entities prior to the purchase of the Class A interest discussed above) was as follows:

(a)

The net expense related to the Company’s interest in the Entities is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations, as International Paper has and intends to effect its legal right to offset as discussed above. After formation of the 2015 Financing Entities, the revenue and expense are included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

(b)

The cash receipts are equity distributions from the Entities to International Paper prior to the formation of the 2015 Financing Entities. After formation of the 2015 Financing Entities, cash receipts are interest received on the Financial assets of special purpose entities.



(c)

The cash payments are interest payments on the associated debt obligations discussed above. After formation of the 2015 Financing Entities, the payments represent interest paid on Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities.

In connection with the acquisition of Temple-Inland in February 2012, two special purpose entities became wholly-owned subsidiaries of International Paper.

The use of the two wholly-owned special purpose entities discussed below preserved the tax deferral that resulted from the 2007 Temple-Inland timberlands sales.  The Company recognized an

$840 million

deferred tax liability in connection with the 2007 sales, which will be settled with the maturity of the notes in 2027.

In October 2007, Temple-Inland sold

1.55 million

acres of timberland for

$2.38 billion

. The total consideration consisted almost entirely of notes due in


issued by the buyer of the timberland, which Temple-Inland contributed to two wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities. The notes are shown in Financial assets of special purpose entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are supported by

$2.38 billion

of irrevocable letters of credit issued by three banks, which are required to maintain minimum credit ratings on their long-term debt. In the third quarter of 2012, International Paper completed its preliminary analysis of the acquisition date fair value of the notes and determined it to be

$2.09 billion

. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of the notes was

$2.10 billion

and

$2.27 billion

, respectively. These notes are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in

Note 14

.

In December 2007, Temple-Inland's two wholly-owned special purpose entities borrowed

$2.14 billion

shown in Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities. The loans are repayable in


and are secured only by the

$2.38 billion

of notes and the irrevocable letters of credit securing the notes and are nonrecourse to us. The loan agreements provide that if a credit rating of any of the banks issuing the letters of credit is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of credit issued by that bank must be replaced within

30 days

with letters of credit from another qualifying financial institution. In the third quarter of 2012, International Paper completed its preliminary analysis of the acquisition date fair value of the borrowings and determined it to be

$2.03 billion

. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of this debt was

$1.97 billion

and

$2.16 billion

, respectively. This debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in

Note 14

.

Activity between the Company and the 2007 financing entities was as follows:

(a)

The revenue is included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and includes approximately

$19 million

,

$19 million

and

$19 million

for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of accretion income for the amortization of the purchase accounting adjustment on the Financial assets of special purpose entities.

(b)

The expense is included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and includes approximately

$7 million

,

$7 million

and

$7 million

for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of accretion expense for the amortization of the purchase accounting adjustment on the Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities.

(c)

The cash receipts are interest received on the Financial assets of special purpose entities.

(d)

The cash payments are interest paid on Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities.

At December 31, 2015, International Paper’s credit facilities (the Agreements) totaled

$2.1 billion

. The Agreements generally provide for interest rates at a floating rate index plus a pre-determined margin dependent upon International Paper’s credit rating. The Agreements include a

$1.5 billion

contractually committed bank facility that expires in

August 2019

and has a facility fee of

0.15%

payable annually. The liquidity facilities also include up to

$600 million

of uncommitted  financings based on eligible receivables balances (approximately

$600 million

available as of December 31, 2015) under a receivables securitization program that expires in

December 2016

. At December 31, 2015, there were no borrowings under either the bank facility or receivables securitization program.

Maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of International Paper’s financing strategy. At December 31, 2015, the Company held long-term credit ratings of BBB (stable outlook) and Baa2 (stable outlook) by S&P and Moody’s, respectively.

NOTE 14 DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

International Paper periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and currency risks. International Paper does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. For hedges that meet the hedge accounting criteria, International Paper, at inception, formally designates and documents the instrument as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge of a specific underlying exposure.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount.

Interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in interest expense. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the hedging



instrument is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. The ineffective portion for both cash flow and fair value hedges, which is not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

We manufacture and sell our products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The purpose of our foreign currency hedging program is to manage the volatility associated with the changes in exchange rates.

To manage this exchange rate risk, we have historically utilized a combination of forward contracts, options and currency swaps. Contracts that qualify are designated as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion, which is not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings.

The change in value of certain non-qualifying instruments used to manage foreign exchange exposure of intercompany financing transactions and certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation is immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure.

COMMODITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Certain raw materials used in our production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility in earnings due to price fluctuations, we may utilize swap contracts or forward purchase contracts.

Derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair values, unless the derivative instruments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale ("NPNS") exception under GAAP and such exception has been elected.  If the NPNS exception is elected, the fair values of such contracts are not recognized on the balance sheet.

Contracts that qualify are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases. The effective portion of the changes in fair value for these instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective and non-qualifying portions, which are not material for any year presented, are immediately recognized in earnings.

The change in the fair value of certain non-qualifying instruments used to reduce commodity price volatility is immediately recognized in earnings.

The notional amounts of qualifying and non-qualifying instruments used in hedging transactions were as follows:

(a)

These contracts had maturities of

three years

or less as of

December 31, 2015

.



The following table shows gains or losses recognized in AOCI, net of tax, related to derivative instruments:

During the next

12 months

, the amount of the

December 31, 2015

AOCI balance, after tax, that is expected to be reclassified to earnings is a gain of $

3 million

.

The amounts of gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statement of operations on qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions were as follows:

(a)

Excluding gain of

$3 million

related to debt reduction recorded to Restructuring and other charges.

(b)

Excluding gain of

$7 million

, net related to debt issuance and debt reduction recorded to Restructuring and other charges.

The following activity is related to fully effective interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges:

Fair Value Measurements

International Paper’s financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value consist of derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts, and other financial instruments that are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and currency risks. In addition, a consolidated subsidiary of

International Paper has an embedded derivative. For these financial instruments and the embedded derivative, fair value is determined at each balance sheet date using an income approach.

The guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures sets out a fair value hierarchy that groups



fair value measurement inputs into the following three classifications:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets.

Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. All of International Paper’s derivative fair value measurements use Level 2 inputs.

Below is a description of the valuation calculation and the inputs used for each class of contract:

Interest Rate Contracts

Interest rate contracts are valued using swap curves obtained from an independent market data provider. The market value of each contract is the sum of the fair value of all future interest payments between the contract counterparties, discounted to present value. The fair value of the future interest payments is determined by comparing the contract rate to the derived forward interest rate and present valued using the appropriate derived interest rate curve.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Foreign currency forward contracts are valued using foreign currency forward and interest rate curves obtained from an independent market data provider. The fair value of each contract is determined by comparing the contract rate to the forward rate. The fair value is present valued using the applicable interest rate from an independent market data provider.

Electricity Contract

The electricity contract is valued using the Mid-C index forward curved obtained from the Intercontinental Exchange.  The market value of the contract is the sum of the fair value of all future purchase payments between the contract counterparties, discounted to present value.  The fair value of the future purchase payments is determined by comparing the contract price to the forward price and present valued using International Paper's cost of capital.

Embedded Derivative

Embedded derivatives are valued using a hypothetical interest rate derivative with identical terms. The hypothetical interest rate derivative contracts are fair valued as described above under Interest Rate Contracts.

Since the volume and level of activity of the markets that each of the above contracts are traded in has been normal, the fair value calculations have not been adjusted for inactive markets or disorderly transactions.

The following table provides a summary of the impact of our derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet:

Fair Value Measurements

Level 2 – Significant Other Observable Inputs

(a)

Included in Other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.



(b)

Includes

$14 million

recorded in Other current assets and

$2 million

recorded in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

(c)

Included in Other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

(d)

Includes

$4 million

recorded in Other accrued liabilities and

$3 million

recorded in Other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The above contracts are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that provide rights of offset with each counterparty when amounts are payable on the same date in the same currency or in the case of certain specified defaults.  Management has made an accounting policy election to not offset the fair value of recognized derivative assets and derivative liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.  The amounts owed to the counterparties and owed to the Company are considered immaterial with respect to each counterparty and in the aggregate with all counterparties.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

International Paper evaluates credit risk by monitoring its exposure with each counterparty to ensure that exposure stays within acceptable policy limits. Credit risk is also mitigated by contractual provisions with the majority of our banks. Certain of the contracts include a credit support annex that requires the posting of collateral by the counterparty or International Paper based on each party’s rating and level of exposure. Based on the Company’s current credit rating, the collateral threshold is generally

$15 million

.

If the lower of the Company’s credit rating by Moody’s or S&P were to drop below investment grade, the Company would be required to post collateral for all of its derivatives in a net liability position, although no derivatives would terminate. The fair values of derivative instruments containing credit-risk-related contingent features in a net liability position were

$1 million

as of

December 31, 2015

and

December 31, 2014

, respectively. The Company was not required to post any collateral as of

December 31, 2015

NOTE 16 RETIREMENT PLANS

International Paper sponsors and maintains the Retirement Plan of International Paper Company (the “Pension Plan”), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides retirement benefits to substantially all U.S. salaried employees and hourly employees (receiving salaried benefits) hired prior to July 1, 2004, and substantially all other U.S. hourly and union employees who work at a participating business unit regardless of hire date. These employees generally are eligible to participate in the Pension Plan upon attaining 21 years of age and completing one year of eligibility service. U.S. salaried employees and hourly employees (receiving salaried benefits) hired after June 30, 2004 are not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan, but receive a company contribution to their individual savings plan accounts (see Other U.S. Plans); however, salaried employees hired by Temple Inland prior to March 1, 2007 also participate in the Pension Plan. The Pension Plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of credited service and either final average earnings (salaried employees and hourly employees receiving salaried benefits), hourly job rates or specified benefit rates (hourly and union employees).



In connection with the Temple-Inland acquisition in February 2012, International Paper assumed administrative responsibility for the Temple-Inland Retirement Plan, a defined benefit plan which covers substantially all employees of Temple-Inland.  The Temple-Inland Retirement Plan merged with the Retirement Plan of International Paper Company on December 31, 2014.

The Company also has three unfunded nonqualified defined benefit pension plans: a Pension Restoration Plan available to employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 that provides retirement benefits based on eligible compensation in excess of limits set by the Internal Revenue Service, and two supplemental retirement plans for senior managers (SERP), which is an alternative retirement plan for salaried employees who are senior vice presidents and above or who are designated by the chief executive officer as participants. These nonqualified plans are only funded to the extent of benefits paid, which totaled

$62 million

,

$38 million

and

$28 million

in


,


and


, respectively, and which are expected to be

$22 million

in


.

The Company will freeze participation, including credited service and compensation, for salaried employees under the Pension Plan, the Pension Restoration Plan and the two SERP plans for all service on or after January 1, 2019. Credited service was previously frozen for the Temple Retirement Plans.  This change will not affect benefits accrued through December 31, 2018. For service after this date, employees affected by the freeze will receive Retirement Savings Account contributions as described later in this

Note 16

.

Many non-U.S. employees are covered by various retirement benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes.

OBLIGATIONS AND FUNDED STATUS

The following table shows the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets for


and


, and the plans’ funded status. The U.S. combined benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2015

decreased by

$302 million

, due to an increase in the discount rate assumption used in computing the estimated benefit obligation partially offset by updated demographic assumptions. Our mortality assumption for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects adoption of the newly issued Society of Actuaries longevity improvement sale, with Company specific adjustments.  U.S. plan assets increased by

$5 million

, primarily reflecting a

$750 million

qualified pension contribution in 2015 offset by benefit payments.



The components of the

$44 million

and

$2 million

increase related to U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, in the amounts recognized in OCI during


consisted of:

The accumulated benefit obligation at

December 31, 2015

and


was

$14.3 billion

and

$14.6 billion

, respectively, for our U.S. defined benefit plans and

$189 million

and

$208 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2015

and


for our non-U.S. defined benefit plans.

The following table summarizes information for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at

December 31, 2015

and


:

ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes. These net gains and losses are recognized prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains in subsequent years. The estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic pension cost for the U.S. plans during the next fiscal year are expected to be

$374 million

and

$41 million

, respectively.

NET PERIODIC PENSION EXPENSE

Service cost is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the plans’ benefit formula to services rendered by employees during the year. Interest cost represents the increase in the projected benefit obligation, which is a discounted amount, due to the passage of time. The expected return on plan assets reflects the computed amount of current-year earnings from the investment of plan assets using an estimated long-term rate of return.

Net periodic pension expense for qualified and nonqualified U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans comprised the following:

(a)    Excludes $1 million in curtailments in 2014 related to the pension freeze remeasurement that were recorded in restructuring and other charges.

The increase in


pension expense reflects a decrease in the discount rate from

4.65%

in


to

4.10%

in


, updated mortality assumptions, higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and a settlement charge in 2015.

ASSUMPTIONS

International Paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of December 31 (the measurement date) and considers changes in these long-term factors based upon market conditions and the requirements for employers’ accounting for pensions. These assumptions are used to calculate benefit obligations as of December 31 of the current year and pension expense to be recorded in the following year (i.e., the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2015

was also the discount rate used to determine net pension expense for the


year).



Major actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for our defined benefit plans are presented in the following table:

(a)    Represents the weighted average rate for 2014 due to the remeasurement in the first quarter of 2014.

(b)

Represents the expected rate of return for International Paper's qualified pension plan for 2014 and 2013. The weighted average rate for the Temple-Inland Retirement Plan was

7.00%

and

6.16%

for 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio. Projected rates of return are developed through an asset/liability study in which projected returns for each of the plan’s asset classes are determined after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of returns and volatility of the various asset classes.

Based on the target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio

is developed considering the effects of active portfolio management and expenses paid from plan assets. The discount rate assumption was determined from a universe of high quality corporate bonds. A settlement portfolio is selected and matched to the present value of the plan’s projected benefit payments. To calculate pension expense for


, the Company will use an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of

7.75%

for the Retirement Plan of International Paper,

a discount rate of

4.40%

and an assumed rate of compensation increase of

3.75%

. The Company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately

$364 million

for its U.S. defined benefit plans in


, with the decrease from expense of

$461 million

in


reflecting  an increase in the discount rate to

4.40%

in


from

4.10%

in


, updated demographic assumptions, and lower amortization of unrecognized losses.

For non-U.S. pension plans, assumptions reflect economic assumptions applicable to each country.

The following illustrates the effect on pension expense for


of a 25 basis point decrease in the above assumptions:

PLAN ASSETS

International Paper’s Board of Directors has appointed a Fiduciary Review Committee that is responsible for fiduciary oversight of the U.S. Pension Plan, approving investment policy and reviewing the management and control of plan assets. Pension Plan assets are invested to maximize returns within prudent levels of risk.

The Pension Plan maintains a strategic asset allocation policy that designates target allocations by asset class. Investments are diversified across classes and within each class to minimize the risk of large losses. Derivatives, including swaps, forward and futures contracts, may be used as asset class substitutes or for hedging or other risk management purposes. Periodic reviews are made of investment policy objectives and investment manager performance. For non-U.S. plans, assets consist principally of common stock and fixed income securities.



International Paper’s U.S. pension allocations by type of fund at December 31, and target allocations were as follows:

The 2014 actual allocations shown represent a weighted average of International Paper and Temple-Inland plan assets as the TIN plan was fully merged into the IP plan by 2015.

The fair values of International Paper’s pension plan assets at

December 31, 2015

and


by asset class are shown below. Plan assets included an immaterial amount of International Paper common stock at

December 31, 2015

and


. Hedge funds disclosed in the following table are allocated equally between equity and fixed income accounts for target allocation purposes.

Equity securities consist primarily of publicly traded U.S. companies and international companies. Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing prices reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.

Fixed income consists of government securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and common collective funds. Government securities are valued by third-party pricing sources. Mortgage-backed security holdings consist primarily of agency-rated holdings. The fair value estimates for mortgage securities are calculated by third-party pricing sources chosen by the custodian’s price matrix. Corporate bonds are valued using either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or using a discounted cash flows approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks. Common collective funds are valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the measurement date.

Commodities consist of commodity-linked notes and commodity-linked derivatives. Commodities are valued at closing prices determined by calculation agents for outstanding transactions.

Hedge funds are investment structures for managing private, loosely-regulated investment pools that can pursue a diverse array of investment strategies with a wide range of different securities and derivative instruments. These investments are made through funds-of-funds (commingled, multi-manager fund structures) and through direct investments in individual hedge funds. Hedge funds are primarily valued by each



fund’s third-party administrator based upon the valuation of the underlying securities and instruments and primarily by applying a market or income valuation methodology as appropriate depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. Funds-of-funds are valued based upon the net asset values of the underlying investments in hedge funds.

Private equity consists of interests in partnerships that invest in U.S. and non-U.S. debt and equity securities. Partnership interests are valued using the most recent general partner statement of fair value, updated for any subsequent partnership interest cash flows.

Real estate includes commercial properties, land and timberland, and generally includes, but is not limited to, retail, office, industrial, multifamily and hotel properties. Real estate fund values are primarily reported by the fund manager and are based on valuation of the

underlying investments which include inputs such as cost, discounted cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data.

Risk Parity Funds are defined as engineered beta exposure to a wide range of asset classes and risk premia, including equity, interest rates, credit, and commodities. Risk parity funds seek to provide high risk-adjusted returns while providing a high level of diversification relative to a traditional equity/fixed income portfolio. These funds seek to achieve this objective with the use of modest leverage applied to lower-risk, more diverse asset classes. Investments in Risk parity funds are valued using monthly reported net asset values. Also included in these funds are related derivative instruments which are generally employed as asset class substitutes for managing asset/liability mismatches, or bona fide hedging or other appropriate risk management purposes. Derivative instruments are generally valued by the investment managers or in certain instances by third-party pricing sources.

FUNDING AND CASH FLOWS

The Company’s funding policy for the Pension Plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans, tax deductibility, cash flow generated by the Company, and other factors. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions.  Contributions to the qualified plan totaling

$750 million

,

$353 million

and

$31 million

were made by the Company in


,


and


, respectively. Generally, International Paper’s non-U.S. pension plans are funded using the projected benefit as a target, except in certain countries where funding of benefit plans is not required.

At

December 31, 2015

, projected future pension benefit payments, excluding any termination benefits, were as follows:

OTHER U.S. PLANS

International Paper sponsors the International Paper Company Salaried Savings Plan and the International Paper Company Hourly Savings Plan, both of which are tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) savings plans.



Substantially all U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees are eligible to participate and may make elective deferrals to such plans to save for retirement. International Paper makes matching contributions to participant accounts on a specified percentage of employee deferrals as determined by the provisions of each plan. For eligible employees hired after June 30, 2004, the Company makes Retirement Savings Account contributions equal to a percentage of an eligible employee’s pay.

The Company also sponsors the International Paper Company Deferred Compensation Savings Plan, which is an unfunded nonqualified defined contribution plan. This plan permits eligible employees to continue to make deferrals and receive company matching contributions when their contributions to the International Paper Salaried Savings Plan are stopped due to limitations under U.S. tax law. Participant deferrals and company matching contributions are not invested in a separate trust, but are paid directly from International Paper’s general assets at the time benefits become due and payable.

Company matching contributions to the plans totaled approximately

$100 million

,

$112 million

and

$120 million

for the plan years ending in


,


and


, respectively.

NOTE 17 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

International Paper provides certain retiree health care and life insurance benefits covering certain U.S. salaried and hourly employees. These employees are generally eligible for benefits upon retirement and completion of a specified number of years of creditable service. Excluded from company-provided medical benefits are salaried employees whose age plus years of employment with the Company totaled less than 60 as of January 1, 2004. International Paper does not fund these benefits prior to payment and has the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans in the future.

In addition to the U.S. plan, certain Brazilian and Moroccan employees are eligible for retiree health care and life insurance benefits.

The components of postretirement benefit expense in


,


and


were as follows:

(a)   Excludes

$7 million

of curtailment gains in 2013 related to the sale of Building Products that were recorded in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the consolidated statement of operations.

International Paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of December 31 (the measurement date) and considers changes in these long-term factors based upon market conditions and the requirements of employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions.

The discount rates used to determine net U.S. and non-U.S. postretirement benefit cost for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


were as follows:

The weighted average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at

December 31, 2015

and


were as follows:

A 1% increase in the assumed annual health care cost trend rate would have increased the U.S. and non-U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at

December 31, 2015

by approximately

$11 million

and

$7 million

, respectively. A 1% decrease in the annual trend rate would have decreased the U.S. and non-U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at

December 31, 2015

by approximately

$10 million

and

$6 million

, respectively. The effect on net postretirement



benefit cost from a 1% increase or decrease would be approximately

$1 million

for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans.

The plan is only funded in an amount equal to benefits paid. The following table presents the changes in benefit obligation and plan assets for


and


:

The non-current portion of the liability is included with the postemployment liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under Postretirement and postemployment benefit obligation.

The components of the

$8 million

and

($5) million

increase and decrease in the amounts recognized in OCI during


for U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, consisted of:

The portion of the change in the funded status that was recognized in either net periodic benefit cost or OCI for the U.S. plans was

$17 million

,

$33 million

and

$63 million

in

and


, respectively.  The portion of the change in funded status for the non-U.S. plans was

$0 million

$14 million

, and

$19 million

in

and


, respectively.

The estimated amounts of net loss and prior service credit that will be amortized from OCI into net U.S. postretirement benefit cost in


are expected to be

$6 million

and

$(4) million

, respectively.  The estimated amounts for non-U.S. plans in


are expected to be

$1 million

and

$(2) million

, respectively.

At

December 31, 2015

, estimated total future postretirement benefit payments, net of participant contributions and estimated future Medicare Part D subsidy receipts, were as follows:



NOTE 18 INCENTIVE PLANS

International Paper currently has an Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP) which, upon the approval by the Company’s shareholders in May 2009, replaced the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (LTICP). The ICP authorizes grants of restricted stock, restricted or deferred stock units, performance awards payable in cash or stock upon the attainment of specified performance goals, dividend equivalents, stock options, stock appreciation rights, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards at the discretion of the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) that administers the ICP.   Additionally, restricted stock, which may be deferred into RSU’s, may be awarded under a Restricted Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors.

STOCK OPTION PROGRAM

International Paper accounts for stock options in accordance with guidance under ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation.” Compensation expense is recorded over the related service period based on the grant-date fair market value. Since all outstanding options were vested as of July 14, 2005, only replacement option grants are expensed.

During each reporting period, diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “in-the-money” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace. When options are actually exercised, option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share, with no effect on reported earnings. Equity is also increased by the tax benefit that International Paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the employees in their individual tax returns.

Under the program, upon exercise of an option, a replacement option may be granted under certain circumstances with an exercise price equal to the market price at the time of exercise and with a term extending to the expiration date of the original option.

The Company has discontinued the issuance of stock options for all eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. In the United States, the stock option program was replaced with a performance-based restricted share program to more closely tie long-term incentive compensation to Company performance on two key performance drivers: return on invested capital (ROIC) and total shareholder return (TSR). All outstanding options expired on March 15, 2015.

The following summarizes the status of the Stock Option Program and the changes during the three years ending

December 31, 2015

:

(a)

The table does not include Continuity Award tandem stock options described below. No fair market value is assigned to these options under ASC 718. The tandem restricted shares accompanying these options are expensed over their vesting period.

(b)

The table includes options outstanding under an acquired company plan under which options may no longer be granted.

PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN

Under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), contingent awards of International Paper common stock are granted by the Committee. The PSP awards are earned evenly over a three-year period. PSP awards are earned based on the achievement of defined performance rankings of ROIC and TSR compared to ROIC and TSR peer groups of companies. Awards are weighted

75%

for ROIC and

25%

for TSR for all participants except for officers for whom the awards are weighted

50%

for ROIC and

50%

for TSR. The ROIC component of the PSP awards is valued at the closing stock price on the day prior to the grant date. As the ROIC component contains a performance condition, compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period based on the most probable number of awards expected to vest. The TSR component of the PSP awards is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation as the TSR component contains a market condition. The Monte Carlo simulation estimates the fair value of the TSR component based on the expected term of the award, a risk-free rate, expected dividends, and the expected volatility for the Company and its competitors. The expected term is estimated based on the vesting period of the awards, the risk-free rate is based on the yield on U.S. Treasury securities matching the vesting period, and the volatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility over the expected term.



PSP grants are made in performance-based restricted stock units. The 2012 PSP awards issued to certain members of senior management were accounted for as liability awards, which were remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date. The valuation of these PSP liability awards was computed based on the same methodology as the PSP equity awards. On December 8, 2014, IP eliminated the election for executives to withhold more than the minimum tax withholding for the 2013 and 2014 grants making them equity awards.

The following table sets forth the assumptions used to determine compensation cost for the market condition component of the PSP plan:

The following summarizes PSP activity for the three years ending

December 31, 2015

:

EXECUTIVE CONTINUITY AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD PROGRAMS

The Executive Continuity Award program provides for the granting of tandem awards of restricted stock and/or nonqualified stock options to key executives. Grants are restricted and awards conditioned on attainment of a specified age. The awarding of a tandem stock option results in the cancellation of the related restricted shares.  The final award under this program was paid in 2013.

The service-based Restricted Stock Award program (RSA), designed for recruitment, retention and special recognition purposes, also provides for awards of restricted stock to key employees.

The following summarizes the activity of the Executive Continuity Award program and RSA program for the three years ending

December 31, 2015

At

and


a total of

,

and

shares, respectively, were available for grant under the ICP.

Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows:

At

restricted performance shares, executive continuity awards and restricted stock attributable to future performance had not yet been recognized. This amount will be recognized in expense over a weighted-average period of

1.6

years.



NOTE 19 FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA

International Paper’s industry segments, Industrial Packaging, Printing Papers and Consumer Packaging Businesses, are consistent with the internal structure used to manage these businesses. All segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.

For management purposes, International Paper reports the operating performance of each business based on earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT). Intersegment sales and transfers are recorded at current market prices.

External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper’s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.

The Company also holds a

50%

interest in Ilim that is a separate reportable industry segment. The Company                                                                        recorded equity earnings (losses), net of taxes, of

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of

December 31, 2015

, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

December 31, 2015

.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to allow for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors;

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; and

•

provide reasonable assurance as to the detection of fraud.

All internal control systems have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control objectives. The Company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures, contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and is audited by the internal audit function. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

As of

December 31, 2015

, management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In a report included on pages 40 and 41, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2015

.

In making this assessment, we used the criteria described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, with direct access to our Board of Directors through our Audit and Finance Committee, has audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by us.  Deloitte & Touche LLP has also issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.  Their report on the consolidated financial statements and attestation report are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report under the heading “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

MANAGEMENT’S PROCESS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we followed a comprehensive compliance process across the enterprise to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, engaging employees at all levels of the organization. Our internal control environment includes an enterprise-wide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top.” This is exemplified by our ethics program that includes long-standing principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of our business, which have been distributed to all employees; a toll-free telephone helpline whereby any



employee may report suspected violations of law or our policy; and an office of ethics and business practice. The internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel, appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility, dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout the Company, and an extensive program of internal audits with management follow-up. Our Board of Directors, assisted by the Audit and Finance Committee, monitors the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting procedures, the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors, and other matters set forth in its charter. The Committee, which consists of independent directors, meets regularly with representatives of management, and with the independent auditors and the Internal Auditor, with and without management representatives in attendance, to review their activities.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended

December 31, 2015

, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
