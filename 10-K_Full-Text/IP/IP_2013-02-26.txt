INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY

INDEX TO ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012


PART I.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

International Paper Company (the “Company” or “International Paper,” which may also be referred to as “we” or “us”) is a global paper and packaging company that is complemented by an extensive North American merchant distribution system, with primary markets and manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Russia, Asia and North Africa. We are a New York corporation, incorporated in 1941 as the successor to the New York corporation of the same name organized in 1898. Our home page on the Internet is www.internationalpaper.com. You can learn more about us by visiting that site.

In the United States at

December 31, 2012

, the Company operated


pulp, paper and packaging mills,


converting and packaging plants,


recycling plants and

three

bag facilities. Production facilities at

December 31, 2012

in Europe, Asia, Latin America and South America included


pulp, paper and packaging mills,


converting and packaging plants, and

two

recycling plants. We distribute printing, packaging, graphic arts, maintenance and industrial products principally through over


distribution branches in the United States and


distribution branches located in Canada, Mexico and Asia. At

December 31, 2012

, we owned or managed approximately

327,000

acres of forestland in Brazil and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government-owned forestlands in Russia. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions.

For management and financial reporting purposes, our businesses are separated into four segments: Industrial Packaging; Printing Papers; Consumer Packaging; and Distribution. Beginning January 1, 2011, the Forest Products business was no longer reported by the Company as a separate industry segment due to the immateriality of the results of the remaining business on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. A description of these business segments can be found on pages 26 and 27 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company’s

50%

equity interest in Ilim Holding S.A. is also a separate reportable industry segment.

From 2008 through 2012, International Paper’s capital expenditures approximated

$4.9 billion

, excluding mergers and acquisitions. These expenditures reflect our continuing efforts to improve product quality and environmental performance, as well as lower costs,

maintain reliability of operations and improve forestlands. Capital spending for continuing operations in


was approximately

$1.4 billion

and is expected to be approximately

$1.4 billion

in


. You can find more information about capital expenditures on page 34 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Discussions of acquisitions can be found on pages 34 and 35 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

You can find discussions of restructuring charges and other special items on pages 24 through 26 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we “incorporate by reference” certain information in parts of other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC permits us to disclose important information by referring to it in that manner. Please refer to such information. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, along with all other reports and any amendments thereto filed with or furnished to the SEC, are publicly available free of charge on the Investor Relations section of our Internet Web site at

www.internationalpaper.com

as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The information contained on or connected to our Web site is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we filed with or furnished to the SEC.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

The financial information concerning segments is set forth in Note 18 Financial Information by Industry Segment and Geographic Area on pages 86 and 87 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. OPERATIONS

The financial information concerning international and U.S. operations and export sales is set forth in Note 18 Financial Information by Industry Segment and Geographic Area on page 87 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.



COMPETITION AND COSTS

Despite the size of the Company’s manufacturing capacity for paper, packaging and pulp products, the markets in all of the cited product lines are large and fragmented. The major markets, both U.S. and non-U.S., in which the Company sells its principal products are very competitive. Our products compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies. We also compete, in some instances, with companies in other industries and against substitutes for wood and wood-fiber products.

Many factors influence the Company’s competitive position, including price, cost, product quality and services. You can find more information about the impact of price and cost on operating profits on pages 19 through 32 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You can find information about the Company’s manufacturing capacities on page A-4 of Appendix II.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

The Company sells paper, packaging products and other products directly to end users and converters, as well as through agents, resellers and paper distributors. We own a large merchant distribution business that sells products made both by International Paper and by other companies making paper, paperboard, packaging, graphic arts supplies and maintenance and industrial products. Sales offices are located throughout the United States as well as internationally.

DESCRIPTION OF PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS

The Company’s principal products are described on pages 26 and 27 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.



SALES VOLUMES BY PRODUCT

Sales volumes of major products for


,


and


were as follows:

Sales Volumes by Product (1)

(1)

Includes third-party and inter-segment sales and excludes sales of equity investees.

(2)

Includes Temple-Inland volumes from date of acquisition in February 2012.

(3)

Includes SCA Packaging volumes from date of acquisition in June 2010.

(4)

Includes APPM volumes from date of acquisition in October 2011.

(5)

Includes internal sales to mills.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Company operates its primary research and development center in Loveland, Ohio, as well as several product laboratories. Additionally, the Company has an interest in ArborGen, Inc., a joint venture with certain other forest products companies.

We direct research and development activities to short-term, long-term and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions, and to process, equipment and product innovations. Activities include product development within the operating divisions; studies on innovation and improvement of pulping, bleaching, chemical recovery, papermaking, converting and coating processes; packaging design and materials development; mechanical packaging systems, environmentally sensitive printing inks and reduction of environmental discharges; re-use of raw materials in manufacturing processes; recycling of consumer and packaging paper products; energy conservation; applications of computer controls to manufacturing operations; innovations and improvement of products; and development of various new products. Our development efforts specifically address product safety as well as the minimization of solid waste. The cost to the Company of its research and development operations was

$13 million

in


,

$13 million

in


and

$12 million

in


.

We own numerous patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights relating to our products and to the processes for their production. We also license intellectual property rights to and from others where necessary. Many of the manufacturing processes are among our trade secrets. Some of our products are covered by U.S. and non-U.S. patents and are sold under well known trademarks. We derive a competitive advantage by protecting our trade secrets, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and by using them as required to support our businesses.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

International Paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally. Our continuing objectives include: (1) controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air, water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment, and (2) maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations. A total of

$60 million

was spent in


for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water, and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste. We expect to spend approximately

$90 million

in


for similar capital projects, including expenditures associated with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Boiler

MACT (maximum achievable control technology) rule. Projected capital expenditures for 2014 environmental capital projects are anticipated to be approximately

$285 million

, much of which is associated with the new Boiler MACT rule. Preliminary cost projections for 2015 environmental capital projects are estimated to be

$300 million

, much of which is again associated with Boiler MACT. In March 2011, the EPA published four inter-related final rules commonly and collectively referred to as “Boiler MACT.” As finalized, these rules required owners of specified boilers to meet very strict air emissions standards for certain substances. The rule was immediately subject to administrative reconsideration by the EPA and several lawsuits.

On December 20, 2012, the EPA issued its final reconsidered Boiler MACT suite of rules. International Paper is actively analyzing the rules to determine, among other things, its costs and this process is in its early stages. As such, the projected capital expenditures for environmental capital projects represent our current best estimate of future expenditures with the recognition that the Boiler MACT analysis is in the early stages and subject to change.

In the U.S., the EPA proposed or finalized a number of new rules, including Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Reporting (see Climate Change section),  and more restrictive National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQSs). The EPA has promulgated new NAAQSs for nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO


) and we anticipate that additional NAAQSs will also be forthcoming. Additionally, the EPA published Phase I of its Pulp and Paper National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). To date, these regulations have not had a material impact on International Paper operations. However, once fully implemented these rules could require significant investments of capital and/or operational changes that could potentially have a material impact.

CLIMATE CHANGE

In 1997, an international conference on global warming concluded with an agreement known as the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol  called for reductions of certain emissions that may contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. While the U.S. and many other countries did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, it has formed the basis for a range of international, national and sub-national proposals and regulations focusing on greenhouse gas reduction. Some of these regulations apply currently or will apply in countries where we currently have, or may in the future have, manufacturing facilities or investments.

Although the Kyoto Protocol expired in 2012, a successor protocol is currently under negotiation at the international level. Several countries or geographic areas in which we operate, such as the EU, India, Brazil,



China and Morocco, have signaled they intend to continue to participate in an extended Kyoto process. While only the EU had actual emissions caps, some countries are enacting local programs to address climate change. Currently, these local programs do not appear to materially impact IP operations. Russia and the U.S. have not agreed to participate in the post-Kyoto process. Due to the lack of clarity around what post-Kyoto will look like, it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of future international agreements on International Paper's operations.  Under the European Union Emissions Trading System (EUETS), the EU has committed to greenhouse gas reductions. International Paper has two sites covered by the EUETS. These measures did not have a material effect on our European operations in 2012, nor are they expected to have such an impact in 2013 at current market prices for emission credits. Significant swings in market price associated with credits could impact European operations.

The U.S. has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol nor have efforts in the U.S. Congress to legislate the control of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions been successful. To date, the activity in the U.S. has been spearheaded by the U.S. EPA and, to some extent, by the states. Pursuant to the GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule promulgated in 2009, the EPA began a process to collect data on emitters of greater than 25,000 tons of greenhouse gas per year. Twenty-four of our U.S. facilities and six closed landfills are covered by and submitted reports as required under this rule. We do not believe that the reporting rule has had nor will have a material impact on our operations. Additionally, the EPA has indicated that it will propose New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for various industry sectors which will limit GHG emissions from certain sources. Currently, the EPA has not identified the pulp and paper industry in the first phase of sectors to be covered by the new standards. However, we anticipate that, at some future time, pulp and paper sources will be subject to new NSPS rules. It is uncertain what impacts, if any, future NSPS will have on International Paper’s operations. The EPA has convened a Science Advisory Board (SAB) to assess the neutrality of biomass when combusted in new sources. The SAB began deliberations in 2011 and submitted recommendations to EPA in late 2012. It is not clear what, if any, of the SAB recommendations EPA will act on or the timeframe in which they may take action. Because the use of biomass is prevalent in the pulp and paper production process, the findings of the SAB and how they are incorporated into climate policy and subsequent regulations could be material to the industry and the Company.

Some U.S. states have considered legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by companies and public utilities, primarily through the

planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. One such state is California. International Paper does not have any sites currently subject to California's GHG regulatory plan. There may be indirect impacts from changing input costs (such as electricity) at some of our California converting operations but these have yet to manifest themselves in material impacts. We are monitoring proposed programs in other states.

It is difficult to predict whether passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by Congress or various U.S. states, or the adoption of regulations by the EPA or analogous state agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business, may have a material effect on our operations in the U.S. In addition to possible direct impacts, future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on International Paper, such as higher prices for transportation, energy and other inputs, as well as more protracted air permitting processes, causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects.

International Paper has controls and procedures in place to stay adequately informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the U.S. and in other countries where we operate to ensure we continue to assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the Company, its operations or financial condition, and whether we have any related disclosure obligations.

In summary, regulation of greenhouse gases continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business. While it is likely that there will be increased regulation relating to greenhouse gases and climate change, at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate either a timetable for the implementation of any new regulations or our costs of compliance.

EMPLOYEES

As of

December 31, 2012

, we had approximately

70,000

employees,

42,000

of whom were located in the United States. Of the U.S. employees, approximately

27,500

are hourly, with unions representing approximately

18,000

employees. Approximately

12,000

of the union employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (USW).

In September 2012, International Paper negotiated the integration of four former Temple-Inland mills into the International Paper/USW Mill Master Agreement



expanding this Master to include 18 of our U.S. pulp, paper and packaging mills. In October 2012, we completed negotiations on the integration of 18 former Temple-Inland converting facilities into the International Paper/USW Converting Master Agreement expanding this Master to include 63 of our converting facilities. These two agreements, the Mill and Converting Master Agreements, cover several specific items, including but not limited to wages, select benefit programs, successorship, employment security and health and safety. Individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other items not covered by these agreements. If local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration, then, under the Master Agreements, the local facility agreements will automatically renew with the same terms in effect at the time of expiration. In October 2012, International Paper negotiated the integration of four former Temple-Inland converting facilities into the International Paper/District Council 2, International Brotherhood of Teamsters (DC2, IBT) Converting Master Agreement expanding this Master to include 16 of our converting facilities.

In addition, during 2012, 36 local labor agreements were negotiated at four mills, 23 converting facilities and nine distribution facilities.

During 2013, 32 labor agreements are scheduled to be negotiated: five mills, 23 converting and four distribution facilities. Twenty-five of these agreements will automatically renew under the terms of the Master Agreements if new agreements are not reached.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical in nature may be considered “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are often identified by the words, “will,” “may,” “should,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “appear,” “project,” “estimate,” “intend,” and words of a similar nature. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and reflect management’s current views with respect to future events, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to: (i) the level of our indebtedness and increases in interest rates; (ii) industry conditions, including, but not limited to, changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, energy and transportation costs, competition we face, cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences, demand and pricing for our products; (iii) global economic conditions and political changes, including but not limited to the impairment of

financial institutions, changes in currency exchange rates, credit ratings issued by recognized credit rating organizations, the amount of our future pension funding obligation, changes in tax laws and pension and health care costs; (iv) unanticipated expenditures related to the cost of compliance with existing and new environmental and other governmental regulations and to actual or potential litigation; (v) whether we experience a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities; (vi) risks inherent in conducting business through a joint venture; (vii) our ability to achieve the benefits we expect from strategic acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings. These and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from such forward looking statements are discussed in greater detail below in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (particularly in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), or in the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.

RISKS RELATING TO INDUSTRY CONDITIONS

CHANGES IN THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION COULD AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.

We rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda and starch), energy sources (principally natural gas, coal and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. The market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. In addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future.

Our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.

THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE EXPERIENCE BOTH ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES.



FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICES OF, AND THE DEMAND FOR, OUR PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. In addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber-based products and non-fiber substitutes. These consumer preferences affect the prices of our products. Consequently, our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products.

COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We operate in a competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally, in all of our operating segments. Product innovations, manufacturing and operating efficiencies, and marketing, distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results.

RISKS RELATING TO MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS

ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN GENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

General economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. In addition, a return to volatility in the capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.

THE LEVEL OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CON-

DITION AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

As of

December 31, 2012

, International Paper had approximately $10.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including $0 of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities and $9.6 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our floating and fixed rate notes. The level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:

•

it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;

•

a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;

•

the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;

•

our indebtedness that is subject to variable rates of interest exposes us to increased debt service obligations in the event of increased interest rates;

•

it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and

•

it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.

In addition, we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants. A significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives.

CHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS ISSUED BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FINANCING AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

Maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy, and a downgrade of the Company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. The Company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the Company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow, including sale of assets, suspension or further reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital.

Under the terms of the agreements governing approximately $4.6 billion of our debt as of



December 31, 2012

, the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating. As a result, a downgrade in our credit rating may lead to an increase in our interest expense. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any such downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.

DOWNGRADES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF BANKS ISSUING CERTAIN LETTERS OF CREDIT WILL INCREASE OUR COST OF MAINTAINING CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS AND MAY RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF DEFERRED TAXES.

We are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes delivered to the Company in connection with our 2006 sale of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating. Since 2006, certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced, or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement. Ongoing uncertainty in the banking environment continues, including continued uncertainty with respect to whether the euro-zone will emerge from its sovereign debt crisis and the rating agencies’ ongoing reassessment of bank ratings. As a result, a number of the letter-of-credit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited. The downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the Company to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of deferred taxes if a replacement bank cannot be obtained. See Note 11 Variable Interest Entities and Preferred Securities of Subsidiaries on pages 69 through 72 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.

OUR PENSION AND HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FACTORS WHICH COULD CAUSE THESE COSTS TO CHANGE.

We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date. We provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees. Our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in

increased pension costs in future periods. Likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension and health care costs. Significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

OUR PENSION PLANS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERFUNDED, AND OVER TIME WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS TO THE PLANS, REDUCING THE CASH AVAILABLE FOR OUR BUSINESS.

We record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. The benefit liability recorded under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” at

December 31, 2012

was $4.1 billion. This includes liability for the International Paper Company pension plans as well as the Temple-Inland Retirement Plan and the Temple-Inland Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, for which we have responsibility in connection with the Temple-Inland acquisition. The amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors, principally the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.

CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the United States in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. Specifically, Brazil, Russia, Poland, China, and India, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities, are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world. Downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences, fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results. Trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including governmental subsidies, tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over International Paper, may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries. In addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the



imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.

RISKS RELATING TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS

EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REQUIREMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Our operations are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements, including with global climate change laws and regulations, Boiler MACT and National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQSs), will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. We could also incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.

RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

The costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty. Although we believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims, or all of them combined, will not have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements, there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS

MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS AT ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. A material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise

operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:

•

fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;

•

the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;

•

terrorism or threats of terrorism;

•

domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our Company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world;

•

unscheduled maintenance outages;

•

prolonged power failures;

•

an equipment failure;

•

a chemical spill or release;

•

explosion of a boiler;

•

damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities;

•

disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;

•

labor difficulties; and

•

other operational problems.

Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. If one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBER-SECURITY RISKS RELATED TO BREACHES OF SECURITY PERTAINING TO SENSITIVE COMPANY, CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE AND VENDOR INFORMATION AS WELL AS BREACHES IN THE TECHNOLOGY THAT MANAGES OPERATIONS AND OTHER BUSINESS PROCESSES.

International Paper business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating and independent third party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers, could become subject to cyber attacks. Network, system, application and data breaches could



result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including, but not limited to interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with International Paper. Access to internal applications required to plan our operations, source materials, manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. Theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, could stem from such incidents. Any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business.

SEVERAL OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED BY JOINT VENTURES THAT WE CANNOT OPERATE SOLELY FOR OUR BENEFIT.

Several operations, particularly in emerging markets, are carried on by joint ventures such as the Ilim joint venture in Russia and the recently established Orsa International Paper joint venture in Brazil. In joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. In general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. In joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. In addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures.

WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND DIVESTITURES.

Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accomplish prudent strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions, and are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits. Among the benefits we expect from potential as well as recently completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers placing higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does International Paper.

For example, on December 12, 2012, the Company signed an agreement to divest our Temple-Inland Building Products business unit to Georgia-Pacific LLC. Our ability to complete the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including approval of the transaction by the U.S. Department of Justice. Failure to consummate the agreed sale to Georgia-Pacific could result in significant delay in accomplishing a divestiture of Temple-Inland Building Products and inability to reach an agreement with one or more alternative purchasers on terms as favorable as the agreement with Georgia-Pacific.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Operating Earnings (a non-GAAP measure) is defined as net earnings from continuing operations (a GAAP measure) excluding special items and non-operating pension expense. International Paper generated Operating Earnings per diluted share attributable to common shareholders of

$2.65

in


, compared with

$3.12

in


, and

$2.30

in


. Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders were

$1.80

in


, compared with

$3.03

in


and

$1.59

in


.

International Paper delivered strong results during 2012 despite challenging global economic conditions, and generated record cash flow from operations of $3 billion.  Our results were primarily driven by the Temple-Inland acquisition and associated integration synergies that exited the year at a run rate above our first-year plan.  We also divested three mills required as a condition to close the Temple-Inland acquisition and announced an agreement to divest the building products business acquired with Temple-Inland.  These divestitures combined will generate more than $1.2 billion of cash once the building products divestiture closes.

Our global operations continued to execute well and deliver on our cost management objectives, contributing to another year of generating returns above our cost of capital.  We reduced our balance sheet debt by $1.9 billion since the Temple-Inland acquisition closed and increased our annual dividend by 14% to $1.20 per share.  We also made significant progress on our strategic and cost-reduction projects, including the Franklin fluff pulp mill conversion, the biomass boiler at our Mogi Guacu mill in Brazil, and our new coated paperboard machine in China, among others.  We also finalized two acquisitions in Turkey and Brazil during the 2013 first quarter that were announced in 2012.  We believe these strategic and cost-saving projects position International Paper well for a step-change in earnings in 2013.

Summarizing our 2012 operations, the Temple-Inland acquisition built a strong foundation for steadily improving, as well as less cyclical, earnings going forward.  The acquisition and impressive integration were meaningfully earnings accretive in less than twelve months.  While the slower global growth environment took its toll on pricing in pulp, consumer grades and export shipments across all our product lines, the worst seems to be behind us as pulp markets have stabilized and rebounded from the bottom and export markets in containerboard have recovered in the second half of the year.  It was another year of excellent execution across

our global operations, as the performance of our mills more than offset ramp-up costs associated with the Franklin fluff pulp mill conversion and the coated paperboard machine start-up at our IP-Sun joint venture in China.  Lower average input costs helped us offset the absence of significant favorable inventory valuation adjustments that we experienced in 2011.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2013, we expect seasonally weaker volume in our Europe-Russia and Brazil papers businesses and stable demand across our North American businesses.  We expect the full benefit of our 2012 fourth quarter North American box price increase to be realized during the 2013 first quarter, but it will be partially offset by unfavorable seasonal mix issues in Brazil.  Operationally, we should see the impact of improved performance across our mill businesses as supply chain conditions improve and one-time unfavorable issues from the 2012 fourth quarter do not repeat.  Further, lower costs at Franklin and the full impact of the biomass boiler in Brazil should provide additional earnings momentum.  As to input costs, we expect higher costs for recycled fiber, wood and energy.  The 2013 first quarter will be another heavy maintenance outage quarter with only a modest decrease in expenses expected.

For the 2013 full year, our outlook for end-use demand is based on global economic growth of three to four percent and growth in the U.S. of one to two percent.  Our largest lever this year is the trajectory of our North American industrial packaging business, with year-over-year earnings improvement due to pricing and continued system optimization.  Further, the ramp-up of our many strategic and cost saving projects during the course of the year is expected to drive significant incremental earnings in 2013 versus 2012.  We do, however, expect higher input costs, primarily associated with fiber and energy, and an unfavorable impact associated with the lost earnings and incremental containerboard purchases from the divested mills.

Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) of

$1.6 billion

generated in


was lower than the

$1.7 billion

generated in both


and


(see reconciliation on page 33).

Operating Earnings per share attributable to common shareholders of

$0.69

in the fourth quarter of 2012 were lower than both the

$0.53

in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with

$0.54

in the third quarter of 2012 and

$0.65

in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Free cash flow of

Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP measure. Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to International Paper Company common shareholders is the most direct comparable GAAP measure. The Company calculates Operating Earnings by excluding the after-tax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under GAAP, and non-operating pension expense. Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. The Company believes that using this information, along with the most direct comparable GAAP measure, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations. The following are reconciliations of Operating Earnings per share attributable to International Paper Company common shareholders to diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to International Paper Company common shareholders.

Results of Operations

Industry segment operating profits are used by International Paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes, equity earnings, noncontrolling interests, interest expense, corporate items and corporate special items. Industry segment operating profits are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-GAAP financial measure, and are not GAAP alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

International Paper operates in four segments: Industrial Packaging, Printing Papers, Consumer Packaging and Distribution. Effective January 1, 2011, the Forest Products Business is no longer being reported by the Company as a separate industry segment due to the immateriality of the results of the remaining business on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



The following table presents a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) attributable to International Paper Company to its total industry segment operating profit:

Industry segment operating profits of

$2.0 billion

in


included a net loss from special items of $335 million compared with $253 million in


and $344 million in


. Operationally, compared with 2011, the impacts of Temple-Inland volumes and synergies ($379 million) and lower input costs ($113 million) were offset by higher costs associated with Temple-Inland step-up depreciation and the impact of divesting three containerboard mills ($141 million), lower average sales price realizations and an unfavorable mix ($313 million), higher operating costs ($186 million) and higher mill maintenance outage costs($31 million).

The principal changes in operating profit by segment were as follows:

•

Industrial Packaging’s profits of $1.1 billion were $81 million higher as the benefits of Temple-Inland  sales volumes and synergies and lower input costs  were partially offset by additional costs associated with Temple-Inland step-up depreciation and the impact of the divestiture of three containerboard mills,  lower average sales price realizations and unfavorable mix, higher operating costs and higher maintenance outage costs. In addition, 2012 operating profits included $184 million of costs associated with the integration of Temple-Inland, a $62 million charge to adjust the long-lived assets of the Hueneme mill to their fair value, and $29 million of costs associated with the divestiture of three containerboard mills. Operating profits in 2011 included $20 million of costs associated with the signing of an agreement to purchase Temple-Inland.

•

Printing Papers’ profits of $599 million were $273 million lower than in 2011. The benefits of higher sales volumes were more than offset by lower sales price realizations, higher operating costs, higher maintenance outage costs, higher raw material and freight costs and other items. Operating profits in 2011 included a gain of $21 million related to the reversal of environmental reserves due to the announced repurposing of the Franklin, Virginia mill and $11 million of asset impairment costs associated with the Inverurie, Scotland mill which was closed in 2009.

•

Consumer Packaging’s profits of $268 million, were $105 million higher than in 2011. The benefits from lower raw material and freight costs, lower maintenance outage costs and lower other items were more than offset by lower sales price



realizations and a less favorable product mix, lower sales volumes and higher market-related downtime, and higher operating expenses.  Operating profits in 2011 included costs of $201 million associated with the fixed asset impairment and sale of the Shorewood business.

•

Distribution’s profits of $22 million were $12 million lower than 2011.  Higher sales price realizations and lower operating costs were more than offset by lower sales volumes.  Reorganization expenses were $49 million in 2012 and $52 million in 2011.

Corporate items, net, of

$51 million

of expense in


were lower than the

$102 million

of expense in


due to lower supply chain initiative expenses. The decrease in


from


primarily reflects lower supply chain initiative expenses.

Corporate special items, including restructuring and other items and net losses on sales and impairments of businesses were a loss of

$49 million

in


compared with a loss of $76 million in


and a loss of

$45 million

in


.

Interest expense, net, was

$672 million

in


compared with

$541 million

in


and

$608 million

in


. The increase in


reflects higher interest expense associated with the Temple-Inland acquisition, while the decrease in


reflects lower debt levels throughout much of the year.

A net income tax provision of

$331 million

was recorded for


, including a net expense of $14 million related to internal restructurings and an expense of $5 million to adjust deferred tax assets related to post-retirement prescription drug coverage (Medicare Part D reimbursements).    The


income tax provision of

$311 million

includes a tax benefit of $222 million related to the reduction of the carrying value of the Shorewood business and the write-off of a deferred tax liability associated with Shorewood, a $24 million expense related to internal restructurings, a $9 million expense for costs associated with our acquisition of a majority interest in Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills Limited, a $13 million benefit related to the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a $2 million expense for other items. The


income tax provision of

$221 million

includes a $14 million tax expense for an incentive compensation deferred tax write-off, a $32 million tax expense for a Medicare Part D deferred tax write-off and a $40 million net tax benefit related to cellulosic bio-fuel credits.

Discontinued Operations

In


,

$54 million

of operating profits for the Temple-Inland Building Products business were recorded in discontinued operations.  In addition,

$9 million

of  after-

tax expenses associated with pursuing the divestiture of this business were included.

In


,

$49 million

of net income adjustments were recorded relating to prior sales of discontinued businesses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

For the year ended

December 31, 2012

, International Paper generated

$3.0 billion

of cash flow from continuing operations compared with

$2.7 billion

in


. Capital spending for


totaled

$1.4 billion

, or

93%

of depreciation and amortization expense. Cash expenditures for acquisitions totaled

$3.7 billion

, while net decreases in debt totaled

$356 million

. Our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately

$2.5 billion

of committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements. Maintaining an investment-grade credit rating for our long-term debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy.

We expect to generate strong free cash flow again in


and will continue our balanced use of cash through investments in capital projects, the reduction of total debt, including the Company’s unfunded pension obligation, returning value to shareholders and strengthening our businesses through acquisitions, as appropriate.

Capital spending for


is targeted at

$1.4 billion

, or about

93%

of depreciation and amortization.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates

Accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial position, and that can require judgments by management in their application, include accounting for contingent liabilities, impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, stock options and income taxes. See pages 38 through 41 for a discussion of the Company’s critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW

While the operating results for International Paper’s various business segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes in International Paper’s operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in North America, Europe, Russia, Latin America, Asia and North Africa. Factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels, and movements in currency exchange rates.

Product prices are affected by general economic trends, inventory levels, currency movements and worldwide capacity utilization. In addition to these revenue-related factors, net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood, recycled fiber and chemical costs; energy costs; freight costs; salary and benefits costs, including pensions; and manufacturing conversion costs.

The following is a discussion of International Paper’s results of operations for the year ended

December 31, 2012

, and the major factors affecting these results compared to


and

of net special items charges and $29 million of non-operating pension expense in


, and

$691 million

, including

$246 million

of  net special items charges and $59 million of non-operating pension expense in


.  Compared with


, benefits from Temple-Inland synergies, lower input costs and lower income tax expense were more than offset by higher costs associated with Temple-Inland step-up depreciation and the impact of the divestiture of three

containerboard mills, lower average sales price realizations and unfavorable mix, higher operating costs, higher maintenance outage costs and higher interest expense. In addition,


results included lower equity earnings, net of taxes, relating to the Company’s investment in Ilim Holdings, SA.

Net interest expense totaled

$672 million

in


,

$541 million

in


and

The decrease in 2011 reflects lower earnings for Shorewood Mexico due to the impairment of the business’ fixed assets.

Special Items

Restructuring and Other Charges

International Paper continually evaluates its operations for improvement opportunities targeted to (a) focus our portfolio on our core businesses, (b) rationalize and realign capacity to operate fewer facilities with the same revenue capability and close high cost facilities, and (c) reduce costs. Annually, strategic operating plans are developed by each of our businesses. If it subsequently becomes apparent that a facility’s plan will not be achieved, a decision is then made to (a) invest additional capital to upgrade the facility, (b) shut down the facility and record the corresponding charge, or (c) evaluate the expected recovery of the carrying value of the facility to determine if an impairment of the asset value of the facility has occurred. In recent years, this policy has led to the shutdown of a number of facilities and the recording of significant asset impairment charges and severance costs. It is possible that additional charges and costs will be incurred in future periods in our core businesses should such triggering events occur.

2012:

As referenced in Note 5 Acquisitions and Joint Ventures on pages 57 through 60 in Item. 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, on July 2, 2012, International Paper finalized the sales of its Ontario and Oxnard (Hueneme), California containerboard mills to New-Indy Containerboard LLC, and its New Johnsonville, Tennessee containerboard mill to Hood Container Corporation.

$62 million

(

$38 million

after taxes) was recorded to adjust the long-lived assets of the mill to their fair value.

2011:

On August 22, 2011, International Paper announced that it had signed an agreement to sell its Shorewood business to Atlas Holdings. As a result, during 2011, net pre-tax charges of

$207 million

(after a

$246 million

tax benefit and a gain of

$8 million

related to a noncontrolling interest, a net gain of

$47 million

) were recorded to reduce the carrying value of the Shorewood business to fair market value. As part of the



transaction, International Paper retained a minority interest of approximately

40%

in the newly combined AGI-Shorewood business outside the U.S. Since the interest retained represents significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business, the operating results of the Shorewood business were included in continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations instead of Discontinued operations. The sale of the U.S. portion of the Shorewood business to Atlas Holdings closed on December 31, 2011. The sale of the remainder of the Shorewood business occurred during January 2012. The assets of the remainder of the Shorewood business, totaling

$196 million

at

December 31, 2011

, are included in Assets of businesses held for sale in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The liabilities of the remainder of the Shorewood business totaling

$43 million

at

December 31, 2011

are included in Liabilities of businesses held for sale in current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, approximately

$33 million

of currency translation adjustment was reflected in OCI related to the remainder of the Shorewood business at

December 31, 2011

.

Also during 2011, the Company recorded charges totaling

$11 million

(before and after taxes) to further write down the long-lived assets of its Inverurie, Scotland mill to their estimated fair value.

2010:

During 2010, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of

$25 million

(

$15 million

after taxes) as a result of the partial redemption of the

10%

interest the Company retained in its Arizona Chemical business after the sale of the business in 2006. The Company received

$37 million

in cash from the redemption of this interest.

Industry Segment Operating Profits

Industry segment operating profits of

$2.0 billion

in


decreased from

$2.2 billion

in


. The benefits from Temple-Inland volumes and synergies ($379 million) and lower input costs ($113 million) were more than offset by higher costs associated with Temple-Inland step-up depreciation and the impact of the divestiture of three containerboard mills ($141 million), lower average sales price realizations and an unfavorable mix ($313 million), higher operating costs ($186 million) and higher mill maintenance outage costs ($31 million).  Special items were a $335 million net loss in 2012 compared with a net loss of $253 million in 2011.

Market-related downtime in 2012 increased to approximately 683,000 tons from approximately 421,000 tons in 2011.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of


, demand for North American and Asian paper and packaging is expected to be stable, while demand in Europe and

Brazil is expected to seasonally decrease. Average sales price realizations in North America are expected to be steady in the domestic paper market, but  increase in packaging markets.  Average sales prices in Europe are likely to be steady for both paper and packaging. In Brazil, paper prices are expected to increase in the domestic market, but decrease for sales to export markets. Input costs in North America are expected to increase for wood, energy and recycled fiber. Planned maintenance downtime costs should decrease in North America, while higher costs in Europe should be offset by lower costs in Brazil. Earnings from our xpedx distribution business are expected to reflect seasonally lower sales volumes, partially offset by cost reductions resulting from the business reorganization. Equity earnings from our Ilim joint venture are expected to be lower.

INDUSTRY SEGMENT RESULTS

Industrial Packaging

Demand for Industrial Packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods production, as well as with demand for processed foods, poultry, meat and agricultural products. In addition to prices and volumes, major factors affecting the profitability of Industrial Packaging are raw material and energy costs, freight costs, manufacturing efficiency and product mix.

($125 million) and higher maintenance outage costs ($18 million). Additionally, operating profits in 2012 include costs of $184 million associated with the acquisition and integration of Temple-Inland, mill divestiture costs of $91 million, costs associated with the restructuring of our European Packaging business of $17 million and a $3 million gain for other items,  while operating costs in 2011 included costs associated with signing an agreement to acquire Temple-Inland of $20 million and a gain of $7 million for other items.

Sales volumes for the legacy business were about flat in 2012 compared with 2011. Average sales price was lower mainly due to export containerboard sales prices which bottomed out in the first quarter but climbed steadily the rest of the year.  Input costs were lower for recycled fiber, wood and natural gas, but higher for starch.  Freight costs also increased. Planned maintenance downtime costs were higher than in 2011. Operating costs were higher largely due to routine inventory valuation adjustments  Operating profits in 2012   benefited from $235 million of Temple-Inland synergies.  Market-related downtime in 2012 was about 570,000 tons compared with about 380,000 tons in 2011.  Operating profits  in 2012 included  $184 million of costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Temple-Inland and $91 million of costs associated with the divestiture of three containerboard mills. Operating profits in 2011 included charges of $20 million for costs associated with the signing of the agreement to acquire Temple-Inland.

Looking ahead to 2013, sales volumes in the first quarter compared with  the fourth quarter of 2012 are expected to increase slightly for boxes due to a higher number of shipping days. Average sales price realizations are expected to reflect the pass-through to box customers of  a containerboard  price increase implemented in 2012.  Input costs are expected to  be higher for recycled fiber, wood and starch. Planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $26 million higher with outages scheduled at eight mills compared with six mills in the 2012 fourth quarter.

Manufacturing operating costs are expected to be lower.

Sales volumes in 2012 were lower than in 2011 reflecting decreased demand for packaging in the industrial market due to a weaker overall economic environment in southern Europe.  Demand for packaging in the agricultural markets was about flat year-over-year.   Average sales margins increased  due to sales price increases implemented during 2011 and 2012 and lower board costs. Other input costs were higher, primarily for energy and distribution.  Operating profits in 2012 included a net gain of $10 million for an insurance settlement, partially offset by additional operating costs, related to the earthquakes in Northern Italy in May which affected our San Felice box plant.

Entering the first quarter of 2013, sales volumes are expected to be stable reflecting a seasonal decrease in market demand in agricultural markets offset by an increase in industrial markets. Average sales margins are expected to improve due to lower input costs for containerboard. Other input costs should be about flat. Operating costs are expected to be higher reflecting the absence of the earthquake insurance settlement that was received in the 2012 fourth quarter.

Printing Papers

Demand for Printing Papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity, direct mail volumes and, for uncoated cut-size products, with changes in white-collar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper. Pulp is further affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage producers in different geographic regions. Principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency, raw material and energy costs and freight costs.

Sales volumes in 2012 were  flat with 2011.  Average sales margins were lower primarily due to lower export sales prices and higher export sales volume. Input costs were higher for wood and chemicals, but were partially offset by lower  purchased pulp costs. Freight costs increased due to higher oil prices.  Manufacturing operating costs were favorable reflecting strong mill performance. Planned maintenance downtime costs were slightly higher in 2012.  No market-related downtime was taken in either 2012 or 2011.

Entering the first quarter of 2013, sales volumes are expected to increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 reflecting seasonally stronger demand.

Average sales price realizations are expected to be relatively flat as sales price realizations for domestic and export uncoated freesheet roll and cutsize paper should be stable.  Input costs should increase for energy, chemicals and wood. Planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $19 million lower with an outage scheduled at our Georgetown mill versus outages at our Courtland and Eastover mills in the fourth quarter of 2012.

. Sales volumes in 2012 were higher than in 2011 as International Paper improved its segment position in the Brazilian market despite weaker year-over-year conditions in most markets.  Average sales price realizations improved for domestic uncoated freesheet paper, but the benefit was more than offset by declining prices for exported paper. Margins were favorably affected by an increased proportion of sales to the higher-margin domestic market. Raw material costs increased for wood and chemicals, but costs for purchased pulp decreased. Operating costs and planned maintenance downtime costs were lower than in 2011.

Looking ahead to 2013, sales volumes in the first quarter are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to seasonally weaker customer demand for uncoated freesheet paper.  Average sales price realizations are expected to increase in the Brazilian domestic market due to the realization of an announced sales price increase for uncoated freesheet paper, but the benefit should be partially offset by pricing pressures in export markets. Average sales margins are expected to be negatively impacted by a less favorable geographic mix.  Input costs are expected to be about flat  due to  lower energy costs being offset by higher costs for  wood, purchased pulp, chemicals and utilities. Planned maintenance outage costs should be $4 million lower with no outages scheduled in the first quarter.   Operating costs should be favorably impacted by the savings generated by the start-up of a new biomass boiler at the Mogi Guacu mill.

Sales volumes in 2012 compared with 2011 were higher for uncoated freesheet paper in both Europe and Russia, while sales volumes for pulp were lower in both regions. Average sales price realizations for uncoated



freesheet paper were higher in Russia, but lower in Europe reflecting weak economic conditions and market demand.  Average sales price realizations for pulp decreased.  Lower input costs for wood and purchased fiber were partially offset by higher costs for energy, chemicals and packaging.  Freight costs were also higher. Planned maintenance downtime costs were higher due to executing a significant once-every-ten-years maintenance outage plus the regularly scheduled 18-month outage at the Saillat mill while outage costs in Russia and Poland were lower.   Manufacturing operating costs were favorable.

Entering 2013, sales volumes in the first quarter are expected to be seasonally weaker in Russia, but about flat in Europe. Average sales price realizations for uncoated freesheet paper are expected to decrease in Europe, but increase in Russia. Input costs should be higher in Russia, especially for wood and energy, but be slightly lower in Europe. No maintenance outages are scheduled for the first quarter.

Sales volumes in 2012 increased from 2011 primarily due to the start-up of pulp production at the Franklin mill in the third quarter of 2012.  Average sales price realizations were significantly lower for both fluff pulp and market pulp.  Input costs were lower, primarily for wood and  energy.   Freight costs were slightly lower. Mill operating costs were unfavorable primarily due to costs associated with the start-up of the Franklin mill. Planned maintenance downtime costs were lower.

In the first quarter of 2013, sales volumes are expected to be flat with the fourth quarter of 2012. Average sales price realizations are expected to improve reflecting the realization of  sales price increases for paper and tissue pulp that were announced in the fourth quarter of 2012. Input costs should be flat. Planned maintenance downtime costs should be about $9 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Manufacturing costs related to the Franklin mill should be lower as we continue to improve operations.

Coated Paperboard sales volumes in 2012 were lower than in 2011 reflecting weaker market demand.   Average sales price realizations were lower, primarily for folding carton board. Input costs for wood increased, but were partially offset by lower costs for chemicals and energy. Planned maintenance downtime costs were slightly lower. Market-related downtime was about 113,000 tons in 2012 compared with about 38,000 tons in 2011.



Foodservice sales volumes increased in 2012 compared with 2011. Average sales margins were higher reflecting the realization of sales price increases  for the pass-through of earlier cost increases.  Raw material costs for board and resins were lower. Operating costs and distribution costs were both higher.

The U.S.Shorewood business was sold December 31, 2011 and the non-U.S. business was sold in January 2012.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2013, Coated Paperboard sales volumes are expected to increase slightly from the fourth quarter of 2012. Average sales price realizations are expected to be slightly lower, but margins should benefit from a more favorable product mix. Input costs are expected to be higher for energy and wood. No planned maintenance outages are scheduled in the first quarter.  In January 2013 the Company announced the permanent shutdown of a coated paperboard machine at the Augusta mill with an annual capacity of 140,000 tons. Foodservice sales volumes are expected to increase. Average sales margins are expected to decrease due to the realization of sales price decreases effective with our January contract openers. Input costs for board and resin are expected to be lower and operating costs are also expected to decrease.

Start-up costs for a new coated paperboard machine adversely impacted operating profits in 2012.

In the first quarter of 2013, sales volumes are expected to increase slightly. Average sales price realizations for folding carton board and bristols board are expected to be lower reflecting increased competitive pressures and seasonally weaker market demand. Input costs should be higher for pulp and chemicals. However, costs  related to the ramp-up of the new coated paperboard machine should be lower.

Distribution

xpedx

, our distribution business, is one of North America’s leading business-to-business distributors to manufacturers, facility managers and printers, providing customized solutions that are designed to improve efficiency, reduce costs and deliver results. Customer demand is generally sensitive to changes in economic conditions and consumer behavior, along with segment specific activity including corporate advertising and promotional spending, government spending and domestic manufacturing activity. Distribution’s margins are relatively stable across an economic cycle. Providing customers with the best choice for value in both products and supply chain services is a key competitive factor. Additionally, efficient customer service, cost-effective logistics and focused working capital management are key factors in this segment’s profitability.

Annual sales of printing papers and graphic arts supplies and equipment totaled $3.5 billion in 2012 compared with $4.0 billion in 2011 and $4.2 billion in 2010, reflecting declining demand and the exiting of unprofitable businesses.  Trade margins as  a percent of sales for printing papers were relatively even with both  2011 and 2010.  Revenue from packaging products was flat at $1.6 billion in both 2012 and 2011 and up slightly compared to $1.5 billion in 2010.  Packaging margins increased in 2012 from both 2011 and 2010, reflecting the successful execution of strategic sourcing initiatives.  Facility supplies annual revenue was $0.9 billion in 2012, down compared to $1.0 billion in 2011 and 2010.

Operating profits in 2012 included $49 million of reorganization costs for severance, professional services and asset write-downs compared with $52



million in 2011.  Operating profits in 2010 included costs of approximately $10 million related to exiting certain retail store and printing equipment segments, and for professional fees related to a strategic study of the xpedx business as a whole.

Looking ahead to the 2013 first quarter, operating results will be seasonally lower, but will continue to reflect the benefits of the ongoing transformation.

Equity Earnings, Net of Taxes – Ilim Holding S.A.

International Paper accounts for its investment in Ilim Holding S.A. (Ilim), a separate reportable industry segment, using the equity method of accounting. Prior to 2012, due to the complex organizational structure of Ilim’s operations, and the extended time required to prepare consolidated financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the Company reported its share of Ilim’s operating results on a one-quarter lag basis. In 2012, the Company determined that the elimination of the one-quarter lag was preferable because the same period-end reporting date improves  overall financial reporting as the impact of current events, economic conditions and global trends are consistently reflected in the financial statements. Beginning January 1, 2012, the Company has applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to all prior financial reporting periods presented.

The elimination of the one-quarter reporting lag for Ilim had the following impact:

Consolidated Statement of Operations

Consolidated Balance Sheet

The Company recorded equity earnings, net of taxes, related to Ilim of

$56 million

in 2012 compared with

$134 million

in 2011 and

$102 million

in 2010. Operating results recorded in 2012 included an after-tax foreign

exchange gain of $16 million on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Operating results recorded in 2011 included an after-tax foreign exchange loss of $24 million on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar-denominated debt.

Sales volumes for the joint venture increased year-over-year for shipments to China and other export markets. Linerboard sales in the domestic Russian market decreased slightly reflecting competitive price pressures in late 2012.  Average sales price realizations were significantly lower in 2012 primarily for softwood pulp, but hardwood pulp and linerboard  also decreased in both the Russian  domestic market and in export markets. Input costs increased year-over-year, primarily for wood.  Freight costs also increased. The Company received cash dividends from the joint venture of $86 million in 2011 and $33 million in 2010. No dividends were paid in 2012.

Entering the first quarter of 2013, sales volumes are expected to decrease due to weak demand in the export markets and a seasonal slowdown in the domestic market.   Average sales price realizations are expected to increase reflecting higher pulp and linerboard prices in the Russian domestic market and slightly higher export pulp prices. Lower  input costs for wood will be partially offset by higher energy costs, while distribution costs are expected to increase.  Commissioning of a new pulp line at the Bratsk mill and a coated and uncoated woodfree paper machine at the Koryazhma mill will be completed in the first quarter with commercial production beginning in the second quarter.  As these projects are placed in service, higher depreciation and interest expense will negatively impact earnings.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

A major factor in International Paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products. While changes in key cash operating costs, such as energy, raw material and transportation costs, do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus on cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.

As part of our continuing focus on improving our return on investment, we have focused our capital spending on improving our key paper and packaging businesses both globally and in North America.

Cash uses during


were primarily focused on higher capital spending and the Temple-Inland acquisition.



Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Cash provided by continuing operations totaled

$3.0 billion

in


compared with

$2.7 billion

for


and

$1.6 billion

for


.

The major components of cash provided by continuing operations are earnings from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash income and expense items and changes in working capital. Earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, decreased by

$304 million

in


versus


driven mainly by a decrease in earnings from continuing operations. Cash used for working capital components, accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable and other totaled

$84 million

in


, compared with

$505 million

The Company generated free cash flow of approximately

$1.6 billion

,

$1.7 billion

and

$1.7 billion

in


,


and


, respectively. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the most comparable GAAP measure is cash provided by operations. Management uses free cash flow as a liquidity metric because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available to maintain our assets, make investments or acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce debt. The following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations:

Cellulosic Bio-fuel Tax Credit

In a memorandum dated June 28, 2010, the IRS concluded that black liquor would qualify for the cellulosic bio-fuel tax credit of

$1.01

per gallon produced in 2009. On October 15, 2010, the IRS ruled that companies may qualify in the same year for the

$0.50

per gallon alternative fuel mixture credit and the

$1.01

cellulosic bio-fuel tax credit for 2009, but not for the same gallons of fuel produced and consumed. To the extent a taxpayer changes its position and uses the

$1.01

credit, it must re-pay the refunds they received as alternative fuel mixture credits attributable to the gallons converted to the cellulosic bio-fuel credit. The repayment of this refund must include interest.

One important difference between the two credits is that the

$1.01

credit must be credited against a company’s Federal tax liability, and the credit may be carried forward through 2015. In contrast, the

$0.50

credit is refundable in cash. Also, the cellulosic bio-fuel credit is required to be included in Federal taxable income.

The Company filed an application with the IRS on November 18, 2010, to receive the required registration code to become a registered cellulosic bio-fuel producer. The Company received its registration code on February 28, 2011.

The Company has evaluated the optimal use of the two credits with respect to gallons produced in 2009. Considerations include uncertainty around future Federal taxable income, the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture credit, future liquidity and uses of cash such as, but not limited to, acquisitions, debt repayments and voluntary pension contributions versus repayment of alternative fuel mixture credits with interest. At the present time, the Company does not intend to convert any gallons under the alternative fuel mixture credit to gallons under the cellulosic bio-fuel credit. On July 19, 2011 the Company filed an amended 2009 tax return claiming alternative fuel mixture tax credits as non-



taxable income. If that amended position is not upheld, the Company will re-evaluate its position with regard to alternative fuel mixture gallons produced in 2009.

During 2009, the Company produced

64 million

gallons of black liquor that were not eligible for the alternative fuel mixture credit. The Company claimed these gallons for the cellulosic bio-fuel credit by amending the Company’s 2009 tax return. The impact of this amendment was included in the Company’s 2010 fourth quarter Income tax provision (benefit), resulting in a

$40 million

net credit to tax expense. Temple-Inland also recognized an income tax benefit of

$83 million

in 2010 related to cellulosic bio-fuel credits.

As is the case with other tax credits, taxpayer claims are subject to possible future review by the IRS which has the authority to propose adjustments to the amounts claimed, or credits received.

Acquisitions

2013:

On January 3, 2013, International Paper completed the acquisition (effective date of acquisition on January 1, 2013)  of the shares of its joint venture partner, Sabanci Holding, in the Turkish corrugated

packaging company, Olmuksa International Paper Sabanci Ambalaj Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. (Olmuksa), for a purchase price of

$56 million

. The acquired shares represent

43.7%

of Omulksa's shares, and prior to this acquisition, International Paper already held a

43.7%

equity interest in Olmuksa. Thus, International Paper now owns

87.4%

of Olmuksa's outstanding and issued shares. The Company has not completed the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; however, the Company anticipates providing a preliminary purchase price allocation in its 2013 first quarter Form 10-Q filing.

Because the transaction resulted in International Paper becoming the majority shareholder, owning

87.4%

of Olmuksa's shares, its completion  triggered a mandatory call for tender of the remaining public shares. Also as a result of International Paper taking majority control of the entity, Olmuksa's financial results will be consolidated with our Industrial Packaging segment beginning with the effective date International Paper obtained majority control of the entity on January 1, 2013.

2012:

On February 13, 2012, International Paper completed the acquisition of Temple-Inland, Inc. (Temple-Inland). International Paper acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Temple-Inland for

$32.00

per share in cash, totaling approximately

$3.7 billion

,  and assumed approximately

$700 million

of Temple-Inland’s debt.  As a condition to allowing the transaction to proceed, the Company entered into an agreement on a Final Judgment with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that required the Company to divest

three

containerboard mills, with approximately

970,000

tons of aggregate containerboard capacity. On July 2, 2012, International Paper sold its Ontario and Oxnard (Hueneme), California containerboard mills to New-Indy Containerboard LLC, and its New Johnsonville, Tennessee containerboard mill to Hood Container Corporation. By completing these transactions, the Company satisfied its divestiture obligations under the Final Judgment. See Note 6 for further details of these divestitures, as well as the planned divestiture of Temple-Inland's Building Products business.

Temple-Inland's results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on February 13, 2012.

2011:

On October 14, 2011, International Paper completed the acquisition of a

75%

stake in Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills Limited (APPM). The Company purchased

53.5%

of APPM for a purchase price of

$226 million

in cash plus assumed debt from private investors. These sellers also entered into a covenant not to compete for which they received a cash payment of

$58 million

. Additionally, the Company purchased a

21.5%

stake of APPM in a public tender offer completed on October 8, 2011 for

$105 million

in cash.



International Paper recognized an unfavorable currency transaction loss of

$9 million

due to strengthening of the dollar against the Indian Rupee prior to the closing date, resulting from cash balances deposited in Indian Rupee denominated escrow accounts.

In November 2011, International Paper appealed a directive from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) that would require us to pay to the tendering shareholders the equivalent per share value of the non-compete payment that was paid to the previous controlling shareholders. The Company has deposited approximately

$25 million

into an escrow account to fund the additional non-compete payments in the event SEBI’s direction is upheld. By an order dated September 12, 2012, the Indian Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) upheld the SEBI directive. As a result of this initial unfavorable ruling, International Paper included the

$25 million

escrowed cash amount in the  final purchase price consideration of APPM. On October 8, 2012, International Paper appealed the SAT's decision to the Indian Supreme Court.

APPM's results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on October 14, 2011.

2010:

On June 30, 2010, International Paper completed the acquisition of SCA Packaging Asia (SCA) for a purchase price of

$202 million

, including

$168 million

in cash plus assumed debt of

$34 million

. The SCA packaging business in Asia consists of


corrugated box plants and

two

specialty packaging facilities, which are primarily in China, along with locations in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. SCA’s results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on June 30, 2010.

Joint Ventures

2013:

On January 14, 2013, International Paper and Brazilian corrugated packaging producer, Jari Celulose Embalagens e Papel S.A (Jari), a Grupo Orsa company, formed Orsa International Paper Embalagens S.A. (ORSA IP). The new entity, in which International Paper holds a

75%

stake, includes

three

containerboard mills and

four

box plants, which make up Jari's former industrial packaging assets. This acquisition supports the Company's strategy of growing its global packaging presence and better serving its global customer base.

The value of International Paper's investment in ORSA IP is approximately

$470 million

. The Company has not completed the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; however, the Company anticipates providing a preliminary purchase price allocation in its 2013 first quarter Form 10-Q filing. Pro forma information related to our investment in the joint venture

is not included as it does not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations. Because International Paper acquired majority control of the joint venture, ORSA IP's financial results will be consolidated with our Industrial Packaging segment from the date of formation on January 14, 2013.

2011:

On April 15, 2011, International Paper and Sun Paper Industry Co. Ltd. entered into a Cooperative Joint Venture agreement to establish Shandong IP & Sun Food Packaging Co., Ltd. in China. During December 2011, the business license was obtained and International Paper contributed

$55 million

in cash for a

55%

interest in the joint venture and Sun Paper Industry Co. Ltd. contributed land-use rights valued at approximately

$28 million

, representing a

45%

interest. The purpose of the joint venture is to build and operate a new production line to manufacture coated paperboard for food packaging with a designed annual production capacity of

500,000

tons. The financial position and results of operations of this joint venture have been included in International Paper’s consolidated financial statements from the date of formation in December 2011.

Additionally, during 2011 the Company recorded a gain of

$7 million

(before and after taxes) related to a bargain purchase price adjustment on an acquisition by our joint venture in Turkey. This gain is included in Equity earnings (losses), net of taxes in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In February 2012, International Paper issued a $1.2 billion term loan with an initial interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 138 basis points that varies depending on the credit rating of the Company and a $200 million term loan with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 175 basis points, both with maturity dates in 2017. The proceeds from these borrowings were used, along with available cash, to fund the acquisition of Temple-



Inland. During 2012, International Paper fully repaid the $1.2 billion term loan.

International Paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and manage interest expense. At December 31, 2012, International Paper had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150 million and maturities in 2013 (see Note 13 Derivatives and Hedging Activities on pages 73 through 77 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). During 2012, existing swaps and the amortization of deferred gains on previously terminated swaps decreased the weighted average cost of debt from 6.8% to an effective rate of 6.6%. The inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short-term investments reduced this effective rate to 6.2%.

Other financing activities during 2012 included the issuance of approximately 1.9 million shares of treasury stock, net of restricted stock withholding, and 1.0 million shares of common stock for various plans, including stock options exercises that generated approximately $108 million of cash. Payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $35 million.

In October 2012, International Paper announced that the quarterly dividend would be increased from $0.2625 per share to $0.30 per share, effective for the 2012  fourth quarter.

In November 2011, International Paper issued $900 million of 4.75% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in February 2022 and $600 million of 6% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in November 2041.

At December 31, 2011, International Paper had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150 million and maturities in 2013 (see Note 13 Derivatives and Hedging Activities on pages 73 through 77 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). During 2011, existing swaps decreased the weighted average cost of debt from 7.1% to an effective rate of 6.9%. The inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short-term investments reduced this effective rate to 6.26%.

Other financing activities during 2011 included the issuance of approximately 0.3 million shares of treasury stock for various incentive plans and the acquisition of 1.0 million shares of treasury stock primarily related to restricted stock tax withholding. Payment of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $30 million.

In June 2010, interest rate swap agreements issued in the fourth quarter of 2009 and designated as fair value hedges with a notional value of $100 million were terminated. The termination was not in connection with the early retirement of debt. The resulting gain of $3 million was deferred and recorded in Long-term debt and will be amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the life of the underlying debt through 2019.

During the first quarter of 2010, International Paper repaid approximately $120 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 5.25% to 7.4% and original maturities from 2010 to 2027. In connection with these early debt retirements, previously deferred gains of $1 million related to earlier swap terminations were recognized in earnings. Pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $4 million related to these debt repayments, net of gains on swap terminations, are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

Also in the first quarter of 2010, approximately $700 million of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, issued

in 2009, were terminated. These terminations were not in connection with early debt retirements. The resulting $2 million gain was deferred and recorded in Long-term debt and is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the life of the underlying debt through April 2015.

At December 31, 2010, International Paper had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $428 million and maturities ranging from one to six years. During 2010, existing swaps increased the weighted average cost of debt from 7.22% to an effective rate of 7.26%. The inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short-term investments reduced this effective rate to 6.86%.

Other financing activities during 2010 included the issuance of approximately 2.6 million shares of treasury stock, net of restricted stock withholding, and 1.8 million shares of common stock for various plans. Payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $26 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Variable Interest Entities

Information concerning off-balance sheet variable interest entities is set forth in Note 11 Variable Interest Entities and Preferred Securities of Subsidiaries on pages 69 through 72 of  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook for


Capital Expenditures and Long-Term Debt

International Paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures, service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements during




through current cash balances and cash from operations. Additionally, the Company has existing credit facilities totaling

$2.5 billion

.

The Company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at

December 31, 2012

. The Company’s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of $9 billion and a total debt-to-capital ratio of less than 60%. Net worth is defined as the sum of common stock, paid-in capital and retained earnings, less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges. The calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and Nonrecourse Financial Liabilities of Special Purpose Entities. The total debt-to-capital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth. At

December 31, 2012

, International Paper’s net worth was $13.9 billion, and the total-debt-to-capital ratio was 42%.

The Company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows. Funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives. The primary goals of the Company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense. The majority of International Paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors.

Maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of International Paper’s financing strategy. At

December 31, 2012

, the Company held long-term credit ratings of BBB (stable outlook) and Baa3 (stable outlook) by S&P and Moody’s, respectively.

Contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at

December 31, 2012

, were as follows:

(a)

Total debt includes scheduled principal payments only.

(b)

Represents debt obligations borrowed from non-consolidated variable interest entities for which International Paper has, and intends to effect, a legal right to offset these obligations with investments held in the entities. Accordingly, in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012, International Paper has offset approximately $5.2 billion of interests in the entities against this $5.2 billion of debt obligations held by the entities (see Note 11 Variable Interest Entities and Preferred Securities of Subsidiaries on pages 69 through 72 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

(c)

Includes

$3.6 billion

relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the 2006 Transformation Plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of Weyerhaeuser Company’s Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business.

(d)

Not included in the above table due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $620 million.

We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2012

, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon. As of

December 31, 2012

, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $840 million. We do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.

Pension Obligations and Funding

At

December 31, 2012

, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s U.S. defined benefit plans determined under U.S. GAAP was approximately

$4.1 billion

higher than the fair value of plan assets. Approximately $3.7 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements. Under current IRS funding rules, the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits(the projected benefit obligation) for accounting purposes. In December 2008, the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 (WERA) was passed by the U.S. Congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections. Funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the Company, and the timing of its implementation, as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make voluntary contributions totaling

$44 million

and

$300 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively. At this time, we expect that required contributions to its plans in


will be approximately $31 million, although the Company may elect to make future voluntary contributions. The timing and amount of future contributions, which could be material, will depend on a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.

Ilim Holding S.A. Shareholder’s Agreement

In October 2007, in connection with the formation of the Ilim Holding S.A. joint venture, International Paper entered into a shareholder’s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners. This agreement provides that at



any time after the second anniversary of the formation of Ilim, either the Company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions. Under certain circumstances, the Company would be required to purchase its partners’

50%

interest in Ilim. Any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by Russian and other relevant anti-trust authorities. Based on the provisions of the agreement, International Paper estimates that the current purchase price for its partners’

50%

interests would be approximately

$350 million

to

$400 million

, which could be satisfied by payment of cash or International Paper common stock, or some combination of the two, at the Company’s option. Any such purchase by International Paper would result in the consolidation of Ilim’s financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods. The parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provision of the shareholders’ agreement, although they have the right to do so.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires International Paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of International Paper, and that can require judgments by management that affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and postretirement benefit obligations, stock options and income taxes. The Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.

Contingent Liabilities

Accruals for contingent liabilities, including legal and environmental matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel. Liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future

remediation alternatives and costs. International Paper determines these estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

An impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations. A goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. Assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. Additionally, testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually. The amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, and various other projected operating economic factors. As these key factors change in future periods, the Company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections.

Under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,” the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units is compared with their carrying value, including goodwill. If fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered to be impaired. If the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value, then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit. This analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any currently unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date. Once these fair values have been determined, the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two. The carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value, or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, through a goodwill impairment charge.

The impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management. In calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one, the Company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets, discounted using the estimated cost-of-capital discount rate for



each reporting unit. These calculations require many estimates, including discount rates, future growth rates, and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit. Subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods. Upon completion, the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions, and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the Company’s market price per share on the analysis date.

No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in


,


or

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

The charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with International Paper’s consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates.

The calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities, the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates.

Benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of

December 31, 2012

, for International Paper’s pension and postretirement plans were as follows:

The table below shows assumptions used by International Paper to calculate U.S. pension expenses for the years shown:

(a)

Represents the expected rate of return for IP's qualified pension plan. The rate for the Temple-Inland Retirement Plan is 5.70%.

Additionally, health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of U.S. postretirement obligations for the years shown were:

International Paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio. The discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.

Increasing (decreasing) the expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets by an additional

0.25%

would decrease (increase)


pension expense by approximately

$24 million

, while a (decrease) increase of

0.25%

in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately

$39 million

. The effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a

1%

increase or decrease in the annual health care cost trend rate would be approximately

$1 million

.

Actual rates of return earned on U.S. pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were:

The 2012 return above represents a weighted average of International Paper and Temple-Inland asset returns.  The annualized time-weighted rate of return earned on U.S. pension plan assets was

5.0%

and

9.9%

for the past five and ten years, respectively. The following graph shows the growth of a $1,000 investment in International Paper’s U.S. Pension Plan Master Trust. The graph portrays the time-weighted rate of return from 2002 – 2012.



ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. These net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans (approximately nine years) to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years. The estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the U.S. pension plans over the next fiscal year are

$490 million

and

$34 million

, respectively.

Net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses, calculated for all of International Paper’s plans, were as follows:

The increase in


U.S. pension expense principally reflects a decrease in the discount rate, a lower expected return on assets assumption and the acquisition of Temple-Inland.  The decrease in 2012 U.S. postretirement expense is principally due to a curtailment gain related to the remeasurement of the Temple-Inland plan.

Assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in


, projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows:

(1)

Based on assumptions at December 31, 2012.

The Company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately

$561 million

for its U.S. defined benefit plans in


, with the increase from expense of

$342 million

in


reflecting a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 4.10% in 2013 from 5.10% in 2012, a lower return on asset assumption for Temple-Inland plan assets to 5.30% in 2013 from 5.70% in 2012 and higher amortization of unrecognized losses.

The market value of plan assets for International Paper’s U.S. qualified pension plan at

December 31, 2012

totaled approximately

$10.1 billion

, consisting of approximately

41%

equity securities,

38%

debt securities,

10%

real estate and

11%

other assets. Plan assets include an immaterial amount of International Paper common stock.

The Company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the Company, and other factors. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future. The required contribution for the U.S. qualified pension plans in 2013 is approximately $31 million. The nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments, which totaled

$95 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

.

Accounting for Stock Options

International Paper follows ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” in accounting for stock options. Under this guidance, expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grant-date fair market value.

During each reporting period, diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “in-the-money” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace. When options are actually exercised, option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share, with no effect on reported earnings. Equity is also increased by



the tax benefit that International Paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns.

At

December 31, 2012

and


,

9.1 million

options, and 15.6 million options, respectively, were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from $33.74 to $41.26 per share for


and $32.54 to $43.12 per share for


.

Income Taxes

International Paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Where the Company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the Company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. Changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies.

While International Paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.

The Company’s effective income tax rates, before equity earnings and discontinued operations, were

32%

,

21%

and

27%

for


,


and


, respectively. These effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year, but may not recur in subsequent years. Management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years. Excluding these special items, the effective income tax rate for


was

29%

of pre-tax earnings compared with

32%

in


and

30%

in


. We estimate that the


effective income tax rate will be approximately 31-33% based on expected earnings and business conditions.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

There were no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year which have had or are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 Recent Accounting Developments on pages 54 through 55 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Information concerning the Company’s environmental and legal proceedings is set forth in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies on pages 65 through 69 of Item  8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

EFFECT OF INFLATION

While inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as energy, wood fiber and chemical costs, have an impact on the Company’s operating results, changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years. Sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS

International Paper has operations in a number of countries. Its operations in those countries also export to, and compete with, imports from other regions. As such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s financial statements. Direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars. Indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the United States (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). In general, a lower U.S. dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to International Paper. The currencies that have the most impact are the Euro, the Brazilian real, the Polish zloty and the Russian ruble.

MARKET RISK

We use financial instruments, including fixed and variable rate debt, to finance operations, for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, financial instruments, including various derivative contracts, are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and foreign currency risks. We do not use financial instruments for



trading purposes. Information related to International Paper’s debt obligations is included in Note 12 Debt and Lines of Credit on pages 72 and 73 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in Note 13 Derivatives and Hedging Activities on pages 73 through 77 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments. We assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and currency rates and commodity prices.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short- and long-term debt obligations and investments in marketable securities. We invest in investment-grade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AAA and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund. Our investments in marketable securities at

December 31, 2012

and


are stated at cost, which approximates market due to their short-term nature. Our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material.

We issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with International Paper’s targeted capital structure, while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate. Derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, may be used to implement this capital structure. At

December 31, 2012

and


, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately

$11.8 billion

and

$10.5 billion

, respectively. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately

$642 million

and

$505 million

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

Commodity Price Risk

The objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. Commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices. The net fair value liability of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at

December 31, 2012

and


was approximately

$1 million

and

$10 million

, respectively. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately

$1 million

and

$2 million

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

Foreign Currency Risk

International Paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries. Our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our after-tax cash flows. We address these risks on a limited basis by financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency, or by entering into cross-currency and interest rate swaps, or foreign exchange contracts. At

December 31, 2012

and


, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately

$13 million

and

$52 million

, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately

$49 million

and

$59 million

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON:

Financial Statements

The management of International Paper Company is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in this annual report and for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America considered appropriate in the circumstances to present fairly the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows on a consistent basis. Management has also prepared the other information in this annual report and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

As can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment, some financial statement amounts are based on estimates and judgments. Even though estimates and judgments are used, measures have been taken to provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial information contained in this annual report. We have formed a Disclosure Committee to oversee this process.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP. During its audits, Deloitte & Touche LLP was given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of stockholders and the board of directors and all committees of the board. Management believes that all representations made to the independent auditors during their audits were valid and appropriate.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of International Paper Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes. All internal control systems have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control objectives. The Company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures,

contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and is audited by the internal audit function. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

The Company has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2012

. In making this assessment, it used the criteria described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of

December 31, 2012

, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The Company completed the acquisition of Temple-Inland in February 2012. Due to the timing of the acquisition, we have excluded Temple-Inland from our evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. For the period ended

December 31, 2012

, Temple-Inland net sales and assets represented approximately 19% of net sales and 25% of total assets.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The report appears on pages 45 and 46.

Internal Control Environment And Board Of Directors Oversight

Our internal control environment includes an enterprise-wide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top.” This is exemplified by our ethics program that includes long-standing principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of International Paper business, which have been distributed to all employees; a toll-free telephone helpline whereby any employee may anonymously report suspected violations of law or International Paper’s policy; and an office of ethics and business practice. The internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel, appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility, dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout International Paper, and an extensive program of internal audits with management follow-up.

The Board of Directors, assisted by the Audit and Finance Committee (Committee), monitors the integrity of the Company’s financial statements and financial reporting procedures, the performance of the Company’s internal audit function and independent auditors, and other matters set forth in its charter. The Committee, which currently consists of four independent directors, meets regularly with



representatives of management, and with the independent auditors and the Internal Auditor, with and without management representatives in attendance, to review their activities. The Committee’s Charter takes into account the New York Stock Exchange rules relating to Audit Committees and the SEC rules and regulations promulgated as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements for the year ended

December 31, 2012

, including critical accounting policies and significant management judgments, with management and the independent auditors. The Committee’s report recommending the inclusion of such financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will be set forth in our Proxy Statement.

REPORT OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of International Paper Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of International Paper Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of International Paper Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the

Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 26, 2013, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of International Paper Company:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of International Paper Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Temple-Inland Inc. (Temple-Inland) which was acquired on February 13, 2012. Temple-Inland constitutes 19% of total net sales and 25% of total assets of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012. Accordingly our audit did not include internal control over financial reporting at Temple-Inland. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the



circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2013

expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF BUSINESS

International Paper (the Company) is a global paper and packaging company that is complemented by an extensive North American merchant distribution system, with primary markets and manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Russia, Asia and North Africa. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to available industry capacity and general economic conditions.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require the use of management’s estimates. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates.

CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International Paper and its wholly-owned, controlled majority-owned and financially controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.

International Paper accounts for its investment in Ilim Holding S.A. (Ilim), a separate reportable industry segment, using the equity method of accounting. Prior to 2012, due to the complex organizational structure of Ilim’s operations, and the extended time required to prepare consolidated financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the Company reported its share of Ilim’s operating results on a one-quarter lag basis. In 2012, the Company determined that the elimination of the one-quarter lag was preferable because the same period-end reporting date improves  overall financial reporting as the impact of current events, economic conditions and global trends are consistently reflected in the financial statements. Beginning January 1, 2012, the Company has applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to all prior financial reporting periods presented.

The elimination of the one-quarter reporting lag for Ilim had the following impact:

Consolidated Statement of Operations

Consolidated Balance Sheet

Investments in affiliated companies where the Company has significant influence over their operations are accounted for by the equity method. International Paper’s share of affiliates’ results of operations totaled earnings of

$61 million

,

$140 million

and

$111 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue is recognized when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated f.o.b. (free on board) shipping point. For sales transactions designated f.o.b. destination, revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer’s delivery site, when title and risk of loss are transferred. Timber and forestland sales revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the buyer.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

Shipping and handling costs, such as freight to our customers’ destinations, are included in distribution expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. When shipping and handling costs are included in the sales price charged for our products, they are recognized in net sales.

ANNUAL MAINTENANCE COSTS

Costs for repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the month that the related activity is performed under the direct expense method of accounting.



TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS

Temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less are treated as cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which approximates market.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. In the United States, costs of raw materials and finished pulp and paper products, other than newly acquired inventory from the Temple-Inland, Inc. acquisition, are generally determined using the last-in, first-out method. Other inventories are valued using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods.

PLANTS, PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT

Plants, properties and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for betterments are capitalized, whereas normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The units-of-production method of depreciation is used for major pulp and paper mills, and the straight-line method is used for other plants and equipment. Annual straight-line depreciation rates are, for buildings —

2.50%

to

8.50%

, and for machinery and equipment —

5%

to

33%

.

FORESTLANDS

At

December 31, 2012

, International Paper and its subsidiaries owned or managed approximately

327,000

acres of forestlands in Brazil, and through licenses and forest management agreements, had harvesting rights on government-owned forestlands in Russia. Costs attributable to timber are charged against income as trees are cut. The rate charged is determined annually based on the relationship of incurred costs to estimated current merchantable volume.

GOODWILL

Goodwill relating to a single business reporting unit is included as an asset of the applicable segment, while goodwill arising from major acquisitions that involve multiple business segments is classified as a corporate asset for segment reporting purposes. For goodwill impairment testing, this goodwill is allocated to reporting units. Annual testing for possible goodwill impairment is performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, with additional interim testing performed when management believes that it is more likely than not events or circumstances have occurred that would result in the impairment of a reporting unit’s goodwill.

In performing this testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the

estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets, discounted using the estimated cost of capital for each reporting unit. These estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to historic market transactions for businesses in the industry, and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the Company’s traded stock price on the testing date. For reporting units whose recorded value of net assets plus goodwill is in excess of their estimated fair values, the fair values of the individual assets and liabilities of the respective reporting units are then determined to calculate the amount of any goodwill impairment charge required. See Note 8 for further discussion.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, measured by comparing their net book value to the undiscounted projected future cash flows generated by their use. Impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value. See Note 6 for further discussion.

INCOME TAXES

International Paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate changes are enacted.

International Paper records its worldwide tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Where the Company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the Company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and the facts of each matter. Changes to recorded liabilities are made only when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, a change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter.



While the judgments and estimates made by the Company are based on management’s evaluation of the technical merits of a matter, assisted as necessary by consultation with outside consultants, historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts, resulting in charges or credits that could materially affect future financial statements.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Compensation costs resulting from all stock-based compensation transactions are measured and recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. In addition, liability awards are remeasured each reporting period. Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award.

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS

Costs associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value when the amount and timing of expected cash payments are reliably determinable.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

A liability and an asset are recorded equal to the present value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of long-lived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The liability is accreted over time and the asset is depreciated over the life of the related equipment or facility. International Paper’s asset retirement obligations principally relate to closure costs for landfills. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated costs or timing of closures, or possible new federal or state regulations affecting these closures.

In connection with potential future closures or redesigns of certain production facilities, it is possible that the Company may be required to take steps to remove certain materials from these facilities. Applicable regulations and standards provide that the removal of certain materials would only be required if the facility were to be demolished or underwent major renovations. At this time, any such obligations have an indeterminate settlement date, and the Company believes that adequate information does not exist to apply an expected-present-value technique to estimate any such potential obligations. Accordingly, the Company does not record a liability for such remediation until a

decision is made that allows reasonable estimation of the timing of such remediation.

TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Balance sheets of international operations are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, while statements of operations are translated at average rates. Adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as cumulative translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

NOTE 2 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Other than as described below, no new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2011-11, “Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities”, which amends ASC 210, “Balance Sheet”. This ASU requires entities to disclose gross and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and those subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. This would include derivatives and other financial securities arrangements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and must be applied retrospectively. The adoption will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

INTANGIBLES – GOODWILL AND OTHER

In September 2011, the  FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-8, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other.” This guidance provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit as described in ASC paragraph 350-20-35-4. This guidance was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company adopted the



provisions of this guidance in conjunction with its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2012 with no material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, "Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment," which amends ASC 350, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other." This ASU gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors if it is  more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amount. If that assessment indicates no impairment, the quantitative impairment test is not required. This amendment is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. The adoption will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-5, “Presentation of Comprehensive Income,” which revises the manner in which entities should present comprehensive income in their financial statements. The new guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either (1) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2)two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance in using the two statement approach in the first quarter of 2012 on a retrospective basis for all periods presented.

In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, “Presentation of Comprehensive Income,” which defers certain provisions of ASU 2011-5 that require entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented (for both interim and annual financial statements). This requirement is indefinitely deferred by ASU 2011-12 and will be further deliberated by the FASB at a future date. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of the remaining requirements of this guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-4, “Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS.” This ASU is the result of joint efforts by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to develop converged guidance on how to measure fair value and what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements. The ASU is largely

consistent with existing fair value measurement principles in U.S. GAAP; however, it expands existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and makes other amendments, many of which eliminate unnecessary wording differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The application of the requirements of this guidance did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed assuming that all potentially dilutive securities, including “in-the-money” stock options, were converted into common shares.

A reconciliation of the amounts included in the computation of basic earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, and diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations is as follows:

(a)

Securities are not included in the table in periods when antidilutive.

(b)

Options to purchase

9.1 million

,

15.6 million

and

18.2 million

shares for the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


and


, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted common shares outstanding because their exercise price exceeded the average market price of the Company’s common stock for each respective reporting date.

CELLULOSIC BIO-FUEL TAX CREDIT

In a memorandum dated June 28, 2010, the IRS concluded that black liquor would qualify for the cellulosic bio-fuel tax credit of

$1.01

per gallon produced in 2009. On October 15, 2010, the IRS ruled that companies may qualify in the same year for the

$0.50

per gallon alternative fuel mixture credit and the

$1.01

cellulosic bio-fuel tax credit for 2009, but not for the same gallons of fuel produced and consumed. To the extent a taxpayer changes its position and uses the

$1.01

credit, it must re-pay the refunds they received as alternative fuel mixture credits attributable to the gallons converted to the cellulosic bio-fuel credit. The repayment of this refund must include interest.

One important difference between the two credits is that the

$1.01

credit must be credited against a company’s Federal tax liability, and the credit may be carried forward through 2015. In contrast, the

$0.50

credit is refundable in cash. Also, the cellulosic bio-fuel credit is required to be included in Federal taxable income.

The Company filed an application with the IRS on November 18, 2010, to receive the required registration code to become a registered cellulosic bio-fuel producer. The Company received its registration code on February 28, 2011.

The Company has evaluated the optimal use of the two credits with respect to gallons produced in 2009. Considerations include uncertainty around future Federal taxable income, the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture credit, future liquidity and uses of cash such as, but not limited to, acquisitions, debt repayments and voluntary pension contributions versus repayment of alternative fuel mixture credits with interest. At the present time, the Company does not intend to convert any gallons under the alternative fuel mixture credit to gallons under the cellulosic bio-fuel credit. On July 19, 2011 the Company filed an amended 2009 tax return claiming alternative fuel mixture tax credits as non-taxable income. If that amended position is not upheld,

the Company will re-evaluate its position with regard to alternative fuel mixture gallons produced in 2009.

During 2009, the Company produced

64 million

gallons of black liquor that were not eligible for the alternative fuel mixture credit. The Company claimed these gallons for the cellulosic bio-fuel credit by amending the Company’s 2009 tax return. The impact of this amendment was included in the Company’s 2010 fourth quarter Income tax provision (benefit), resulting in a

$40 million

net credit to tax expense. Temple-Inland, Inc. also recognized an income tax benefit of

$83 million

in 2010 related to cellulosic bio-fuel credits.

As is the case with other tax credits, taxpayer claims are subject to possible future review by the IRS which has the authority to propose adjustments to the amounts claimed, or credits received.

NOTE 5 ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES

ACQUISITIONS

2013:

On January 3, 2013, International Paper completed the acquisition (effective date of acquisition on January 1, 2013)  of the shares of its joint venture partner, Sabanci Holding, in the Turkish corrugated packaging company, Olmuksa International Paper Sabanci Ambalaj Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. (Olmuksa), for a purchase price of

$56 million

. The acquired shares represent

43.7%

of Olmuksa's shares, and prior to this acquisition, International Paper already held a

43.7%

equity interest in Olmuksa. Thus, International Paper now owns

87.4%

of Olmuksa's outstanding and issued shares. The Company has not completed the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; however, the Company anticipates providing a preliminary purchase price allocation in its 2013 first quarter Form 10-Q filing.

Because the transaction resulted in International Paper becoming the majority shareholder, owning

87.4%

of Olmuksa's shares, its completion  triggered a mandatory call for tender of the remaining public shares. Also as a result of International Paper taking majority control of the entity, Olmuksa's financial results will be consolidated with our Industrial Packaging segment beginning with the effective date International Paper obtained majority control of the entity on January 1, 2013.

Pro forma information related to the acquisition of Olmuksa has not been included as it does not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations.

2012:

On February 13, 2012, International Paper completed the acquisition of Temple-Inland, Inc. (Temple-Inland). International Paper acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Temple-Inland for

$32.00

per share in cash, totaling approximately

$3.7 billion

,



and assumed approximately

$700 million

of Temple-Inland’s debt.  As a condition to allowing the transaction to proceed, the Company entered into an agreement on a Final Judgment with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that required the Company to divest

three

containerboard mills, with approximately

970,000

tons of aggregate containerboard capacity. On July 2, 2012, International Paper sold its Ontario and Oxnard (Hueneme), California containerboard mills to New-Indy Containerboard LLC, and its New Johnsonville, Tennessee containerboard mill to Hood Container Corporation. By completing these transactions, the Company satisfied its divestiture obligations under the Final Judgment. See Note 6 for further details of these divestitures, as well as the planned divestiture of Temple-Inland's Building Products business.

Temple-Inland's results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on February 13, 2012.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as of February 13, 2012.

The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2012.

The identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the Temple-Inland acquisition included the following:

In connection with the purchase price allocation, inventories were written up by approximately

$20 million

before taxes (

$12 million

after taxes) to their estimated fair value. As the related inventories were sold in the 2012 first quarter, this amount was expensed in Cost of products sold for the quarter.

Additionally, Selling and administrative expenses for the year ended

December 31, 2012

included

$164 million

before taxes (

$105 million

after taxes) in charges for integration  costs associated with the acquisition.

The following unaudited pro forma information for the years ended

December 31, 2012

and


represents the results of operations of International Paper as if the Temple-Inland acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2011. This information is based on historical results of operations, adjusted for certain acquisition accounting adjustments and does not purport to represent International Paper’s actual results of operations as if the transaction described above would have occurred as of January 1, 2011, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.

(a) Attributable to International Paper Company common shareholders.

2011:

On October 14, 2011, International Paper completed the acquisition of a

75%

stake in Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills Limited (APPM). The Company purchased

53.5%

of APPM for a purchase price of

$226 million

in cash plus assumed debt from private investors. These sellers also entered into a covenant not to compete for which they received a cash payment



of

$58 million

. Additionally, the Company purchased a

21.5%

stake of APPM in a public tender offer completed on October 8, 2011 for

$105 million

in cash. International Paper recognized an unfavorable currency transaction loss of

$9 million

due to strengthening of the dollar against the Indian Rupee prior to the closing date, resulting from cash balances deposited in Indian Rupee denominated escrow accounts.

In November 2011, International Paper appealed a directive from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) that would require us to pay to the tendering shareholders the equivalent per share value of the non-compete payment that was paid to the previous controlling shareholders. The Company has deposited approximately

$25 million

into an escrow account to fund the additional non-compete payments in the event SEBI’s direction is upheld. By an order dated September 12, 2012, the Indian Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) upheld the SEBI directive. As a result of this initial unfavorable ruling, International Paper included the

$25 million

escrowed cash amount in the  final purchase price consideration of APPM. On October 8, 2012, International Paper appealed the SAT's decision to the Indian Supreme Court.

APPM's results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on October 14, 2011.

The following table summarizes the final allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as of October 14, 2011.

The identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the APPM acquisition included the following:

Pro forma information related to the acquisition of APPM has not been included as it does not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations.

2010:

On June 30, 2010, International Paper completed the acquisition of SCA Packaging Asia (SCA) for a purchase price of

$202 million

, including

$168 million

in cash plus assumed debt of

$34 million

. The SCA packaging business in Asia consists of


corrugated box plants and

two

specialty packaging facilities, which are primarily in China, along with locations in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. SCA’s results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on June 30, 2010.

The following table summarizes the final allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as of June 30, 2010.



The identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the SCA acquisition included the following:

Pro forma information related to the acquisition of SCA has not been included as it does not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations.

JOINT VENTURES

2013:

On January 14, 2013, International Paper and Brazilian corrugated packaging producer, Jari Celulose Embalagens e Papel S.A (Jari), a Grupo Orsa company, formed Orsa International Paper Embalagens S.A. (ORSA IP). The new entity, in which International Paper holds a

75%

stake, includes

three

containerboard mills and

four

box plants, which make up Jari's former industrial packaging assets. This acquisition supports the Company's strategy of growing its global packaging presence and better serving its global customer base.

The value of International Paper's investment in ORSA IP is approximately

$470 million

. The Company has not completed the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; however, the Company anticipates providing a preliminary purchase price allocation in its 2013 first quarter Form 10-Q filing. Pro forma information related to our investment in the joint venture is not included as it does not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations. Because International Paper acquired majority control of the joint venture, ORSA IP's financial results will be consolidated with our Industrial Packaging segment from the date of formation on January 14, 2013.

Pro forma information related to the acquisition of ORSA IP has not been included as it does not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations.

2011:

On April 15, 2011, International Paper and Sun Paper Industry Co. Ltd. entered into a Cooperative Joint Venture agreement to establish Shandong IP & Sun Food Packaging Co., Ltd. in China. During December 2011, the business license was obtained and International Paper contributed

$55 million

in cash for a

55%

interest in the joint venture and Sun Paper Industry Co. Ltd. contributed land-use rights valued at approximately

$28 million

, representing a

45%

interest. The purpose of the joint venture is to build and operate

a new production line to manufacture coated paperboard for food packaging with a designed annual production capacity of

500,000

tons. The financial position and results of operations of this joint venture have been included in International Paper’s consolidated financial statements from the date of formation in December 2011.

Additionally, during 2011 the Company recorded a gain of

$7 million

(before and after taxes) related to a bargain purchase price adjustment on an acquisition by our joint venture in Turkey. This gain is included in Equity earnings (losses), net of taxes in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

NOTE 6 BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE, DIVESTITURES AND IMPAIRMENTS

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

2012:

Upon the acquisition of Temple-Inland, management committed to a plan to sell the Temple-Inland Building Products business, and on December 12, 2012, International Paper reached an agreement to sell the business (including Del-Tin Fiber L.L.C. (Del-Tin))  to Georgia-Pacific for

$750 million

in cash, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including satisfactory review by the DOJ, and to certain pre-and post-closing purchase price adjustments. The assets to be sold include


manufacturing facilities. Subsequently, on February 13, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to sell Temple-Inland's

50%

interest in Del-Tin to joint venture partner Deltic Timber Corporation (Deltic) for

$20 million

in assumed liabilities and cash. Accordingly, the Del-Tin assets will be excluded from the sale to Georgia-Pacific and the purchase price under our sale agreement with Georgia-Pacific will be adjusted to

$710 million

. The operating results of the Temple-Inland Building Products business have been included in Discontinued operations from the date of acquisition. The assets of this business, totaling

$759 million

at

December 31, 2012

, are included in Assets of businesses held for sale in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at

December 31, 2012

. Included in this amount are

$26 million

and

$153 million

related to goodwill and intangibles, respectively. The liabilities of this business, totaling

$44 million

at

December 31, 2012

, are included in Liabilities of businesses held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at

December 31, 2012

.

2011:

The sale of the Company’s Kraft Papers business that closed in January 2007 contained an earnout provision that could have required KapStone to make an additional payment to International Paper in 2012. Based on the results through the first four years of the earnout period, KapStone concluded that the threshold would be attained and the full earnout payment would



be due to International Paper in 2012. On January 3, 2011, International Paper signed an agreement with KapStone to allow KapStone to pay the Company on January 4, 2011, the discounted amount of

$50 million

before taxes (

$30 million

after taxes) that otherwise would have been owed in full under the agreement in 2012. This amount has been included in Discontinued operations, net of taxes in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In the third quarter of 2006, the Company completed the sale of its Brazilian Coated Papers business and restated its financial statements to reflect this business as a discontinued operation. Included in the results for this business in 2005 and 2006 were local country tax contingency reserves for which the related statute of limitations has now expired. A

$15 million

tax benefit for the reversal of these reserves plus associated interest income of

$6 million

before taxes (

$4 million

after taxes) was recorded in March 2011, and is included in Discontinued operations, net of taxes in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

OTHER DIVESTITURES AND IMPAIRMENTS

2012:

As referenced in Note 5, on July 2, 2012, International Paper finalized the sales of its Ontario and Oxnard (Hueneme), California containerboard mills to New-Indy Containerboard LLC, and its New Johnsonville, Tennessee containerboard mill to Hood Container Corporation. During 2012, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of

$29 million

(

$55 million

after taxes) for costs associated with the divestitures of these mills. Also during 2012, in anticipation of the divestiture of the Hueneme mill, a pre-tax charge of

$62 million

(

$38 million

after taxes) was recorded to adjust the long-lived assets of the mill to their fair value.

The net


loss totaling

$86 million

related to other divestitures and impairments is included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

2011:

On August 22, 2011, International Paper announced that it had signed an agreement to sell its Shorewood business to Atlas Holdings. As a result, during 2011, net pre-tax charges of

$207 million

(after a

$246 million

tax benefit and a gain of

$8 million

related to a noncontrolling interest, a net gain of

$47 million

) were recorded to reduce the carrying value of the Shorewood business to fair market value. As part of the transaction, International Paper retained a minority interest of approximately

40%

in the newly combined AGI-Shorewood business outside the U.S. Since the interest retained represents significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business, the operating results of the Shorewood business were included in continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations instead of Discontinued operations. The sale of the U.S. portion

of the Shorewood business to Atlas Holdings closed on December 31, 2011. The sale of the remainder of the Shorewood business occurred during January 2012. The assets of the remainder of the Shorewood business, totaling

$196 million

at

December 31, 2011

, are included in Assets of businesses held for sale in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The liabilities of the remainder of the Shorewood business totaling

$43 million

at

December 31, 2011

are included in Liabilities of businesses held for sale in current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, approximately

$33 million

of currency translation adjustment was reflected in OCI related to the remainder of the Shorewood business at

December 31, 2011

.

Also during 2011, the Company recorded charges totaling

$11 million

(before and after taxes) to further write down the long-lived assets of its Inverurie, Scotland mill to their estimated fair value.

The net


loss totaling

$218 million

related to other divestitures and impairments is included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

2010:

During 2010, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of

$25 million

(

$15 million

after taxes) as a result of the partial redemption of the

10%

interest the Company retained in its Arizona Chemical business after the sale of the business in 2006. The Company received

$37 million

in cash from the redemption of this interest.

The net


gain totaling

$23 million

related to other divestitures and impairments is included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

NOTE 7 SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE

Accounts and notes receivable, net of allowances, by classification were:



INVENTORIES

The last-in, first-out inventory method is used to value most of International Paper’s U.S. inventories. Approximately

64%

of total raw materials and finished products inventories were valued using this method. If the first-in, first-out method had been used, it would have increased total inventory balances by approximately

$381 million

and

$350 million

at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

PLANTS, PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT

INTEREST

Cash payments related to interest were as follows:

Amounts related to interest were as follows:

On September 23, 2010, the Company finalized the sale of

163,000

acres of properties located in the southeastern United States to an affiliate of Rock Creek Capital (the Partnership) for

$199 million

, resulting in a

$50 million

pre-tax gain (

$31 million

after taxes), after expenses. Cash of

$160 million

was received at closing, with the balance of

$39 million

, plus interest, to be received no later than three years from closing. In addition, the Company has retained a

OTHER INTANGIBLES

Identifiable intangible assets comprised the following:

(a)

The increase in 2012 is primarily due to the acquisition of Temple-Inland.

The Company recognized the following amounts as amortization expense related to intangible assets:

Based on current intangibles subject to amortization, estimated amortization expense for each of the succeeding years is as follows:


–

$37 million

,


–

$36 million

,


–

,


–

$29 million

,


–

$28 million

, and cumulatively thereafter –

.

NOTE 9 INCOME TAXES

The components of International Paper’s earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings by taxing jurisdiction were as follows:

The provision (benefit) for income taxes (excluding noncontrolling interests) by taxing jurisdiction was as follows:

The Company’s deferred income tax provision (benefit) includes a

$25 million

provision, an

$8 million

benefit and a

$0 million

provision for


,


and


, respectively, for the effect of changes in non-U.S. and U.S. state tax rates.

International Paper made income tax payments, net of refunds, of

$95 million

,

$44 million

and

$(135) million

in


,


and


, respectively.



A reconciliation of income tax expense using the statutory U.S. income tax rate compared with the actual income tax provision follows:

The tax effects of significant temporary differences, representing deferred income tax assets and liabilities at

December 31, 2012

and


, were as follows:

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under the captions Deferred income tax assets, Deferred charges and other assets, Other accrued liabilities, and Deferred income taxes. The acquisition of Temple-Inland in 2012 resulted in additional deferred tax assets of

$600 million

and deferred income tax liabilities of

$1.8 billion

.  In addition, there is an increase in deferred income tax assets principally relating to the tax impact of changes in qualified pension liabilities. Certain tax attributes reflected on our tax returns as filed differ significantly from those reflected in the deferred income tax accounts due to uncertain tax benefits.

The valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets as of

December 31, 2012

was

$400 million

. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended

December 31, 2012

was a decrease of

$24 million

. The decrease is primarily attributable to the release of a valuation allowance previously imposed on state income tax attributes which the Company now foresees utilizing.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


and


is as follows:

Included in the balance at

December 31, 2012

,


and


are

$14 million

,

$9 million

and

$13 million

, respectively, for tax positions for which the ultimate benefits are highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such benefits. However, except for the possible effect of any penalties, any disallowance that would change the timing of these benefits would not affect the annual effective tax rate, but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.

The Company accrues interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The Company had approximately

$104 million

and

$88 million

accrued for the payment of estimated interest and penalties associated with



unrecognized tax benefits at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

The major jurisdictions where the Company files income tax returns are the United States, Brazil, France, Poland and Russia. Generally, tax years 2002 through 2011 remain open and subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. The Company is typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time, both in the United States and overseas. Currently, the Company is engaged in discussions with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service regarding the examination of tax years 2006 through 2009. As a result of these discussions, other pending tax audit settlements, and the expiration of statutes of limitation, the Company currently estimates that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to

$860 million

during the next twelve months. During


, unrecognized tax benefits increased by

$115 million

primarily driven by the acquisition of Temple-Inland. While the Company believes that it is adequately accrued for possible audit adjustments, the final resolution of these examinations cannot be determined at this time and could result in final settlements that differ from current estimates.

Included in the Company’s


,


and


income tax provision (benefit) are

$(85) million

,

$(266) million

and

$(143) million

, respectively, related to special items. The components of the net provisions related to special items were as follows:

Excluding the impact of special items, the


,


and


income tax provisions were

$410 million

,

$577 million

and

$364 million

, respectively, or

29%

,

32%

and

30%

, respectively, of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.

The following details the scheduled expiration dates of the Company’s net operating loss and income tax credit carryforwards:

Deferred income taxes are not provided for temporary differences of approximately

$4.7 billion

,

$4.5 billion

and

$4.3 billion

as of

December 31, 2012

,


and


, respectively, representing earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries intended to be permanently reinvested. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and other basis differences is not practicable.

The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the “Act”) was signed into law on January 2, 2013. The Act retroactively restored several expired business tax provisions, including the research and experimentation credit and the Subpart F controlled foreign corporation look-through exception. Because a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment, the retroactive effect of the Act on the Company's U.S. federal taxes for 2012 of a benefit of approximately

$32 million

will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, we expect the Act's extension of these provisions through the end of 2013 will favorably impact our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2013 by approximately

one

percentage point.

NOTE 10 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND OPERATING LEASES

Certain property, machinery and equipment are leased under cancelable and non-cancelable agreements.

Unconditional purchase obligations have been entered into in the ordinary course of business, principally for capital projects and the purchase of certain pulpwood, logs, wood chips, raw materials, energy and services, including fiber supply agreements to purchase pulpwood that were entered into concurrently with the Company’s 2006 Transformation Plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of Weyerhaeuser Company’s Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business.



At

December 31, 2012

, total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operating leases and purchase obligations were as follows:

(a)

Includes

$3.6 billion

relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the Company’s 2006 Transformation Plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of Weyerhaeuser Company’s Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business.

Rent expense was

$231 million

,

$205 million

and

$210 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

GUARANTEES

In connection with sales of businesses, property, equipment, forestlands and other assets, International Paper commonly makes representations and warranties relating to such businesses or assets, and may agree to indemnify buyers with respect to tax and environmental liabilities, breaches of representations and warranties, and other matters. Where liabilities for such matters are determined to be probable and subject to reasonable estimation, accrued liabilities are recorded at the time of sale as a cost of the transaction.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

International Paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Many of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources. While joint and several liability is authorized under CERCLA and equivalent state laws, as a practical matter, liability for CERCLA cleanups is typically allocated among the many potential responsible parties. Remedial costs are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become probable and reasonably estimable. International Paper has estimated the probable liability associated with these matters to be approximately

$92 million

in the aggregate at

December 31, 2012

.

One of the matters referenced above is a closed wood treating facility located in Cass Lake, Minnesota. During 2009, in connection with an environmental site remediation action under CERCLA, International Paper submitted to the EPA a site remediation feasibility study. In June 2011, the EPA selected and published a proposed soil remedy at the site with an estimated cost

of

$46 million

. The overall remediation reserve for the site is currently

$48 million

to address this selection of an alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy. In October 2011, the EPA released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy decision would be delayed. In the unlikely event that the EPA changes its proposed soil remedy and approves instead a more expensive clean-up alternative, the remediation costs could be material, and significantly higher than amounts currently recorded. In October 2012, the Natural Resource Trustees for this site provided notice to International Paper and other potentially responsible parties of their intent to perform a Natural Resource Damage Assessment. It is premature to predict the outcome of the assessment or to estimate a loss or range of loss, if any, which may be incurred.

In addition to the above matters, other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the Company’s current, closed or formerly-owned facilities, and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet, totaled approximately

$46 million

at

December 31, 2012

. Other than as described above, completion of required remedial actions is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

The Company is a potentially responsible party with respect to the Allied Paper, Inc./Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River Superfund Site (Kalamazoo River Superfund Site) in Michigan. The EPA asserts that the site is contaminated primarily by PCBs as a result of discharges from various paper mills located along the river, including a paper mill formerly owned by St. Regis. The Company is a successor in interest to St. Regis. International Paper has not received any orders from the EPA with respect to the site and is in the process of collecting information from the EPA and other parties relative to the Kalamazoo River Superfund Site to evaluate the extent of its liability, if any, with respect to the site. Accordingly, it is premature to estimate a loss or range of loss with respect to this site.

Also in connection with the Kalamazoo River Superfund Site, the Company was named as a defendant by Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP, Fort James Corporation and Georgia Pacific LLC in a contribution and cost recovery action for alleged pollution at the Kalamazoo River Superfund Site. The suit seeks contribution under CERCLA for

$79 million

in costs purportedly expended by plaintiffs as of the filing of the complaint, and for future remediation costs. The suit alleges that a mill, during the time it was allegedly owned and operated by St. Regis, discharged PCB contaminated solids and paper residuals resulting from paper de-inking and recycling. Also named as defendants in the suit are NCR Corporation and Weyerhaeuser Company. In mid-2011, the suit was



transferred from the District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin to the District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The case has been split into a liability phase and a potential subsequent allocation/damages phase. The Company is now involved in the liability phase of the case and believes it is premature to predict the outcome or to estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, which may be incurred.

International Paper and McGinnis Industrial Maintenance Corporation, a subsidiary of Waste Management, Inc., are potentially responsible parties at the San Jacinto River Superfund Site in Harris County, Texas, and have been actively participating in investigation and remediation activities at this Superfund Site. In December 2011, Harris County, Texas filed a suit against the Company in Harris County District Court seeking civil penalties with regard to the alleged discharge of dioxin into the San Jacinto River since 1965 from the San Jacinto River Superfund Site. Also named as defendants in this action are McGinnis Industrial Maintenance Corporation, Waste Management, Inc. and Waste Management of Texas, Inc. Harris County is seeking civil penalties pursuant to the Texas Water Code, which provides for the imposition of civil penalties between

$50

and

$25,000

per day. The case is in its preliminary stages and it is therefore premature to predict the outcome or to estimate a loss or range of loss, if any, which may be incurred.

In October 2012, a civil lawsuit was filed against the same defendants, including the Company, in the District Court of Harris County by what are now


plaintiffs seeking medical monitoring and damages with regard to the alleged discharge of dioxin into the San Jacinto River since 1965 from waste impoundments that are a part of the San Jacinto Superfund Site. This case is in its early stages and it is therefore premature to predict the outcome or to estimate a loss or range of loss, if any, which may be incurred. In December 2012, residents of an up-river neighborhood filed a civil action against the same defendants, including the Company, in the District Court of Harris County alleging property damage and personal injury from the alleged discharge of dioxin into the San Jacinto River from the San Jacinto Superfund Site. This case is in the discovery phase and it is therefore premature to predict the outcome or to estimate a loss or range of loss, if any, which may be incurred.

In August 2011, Temple-Inland's Bogalusa, Louisiana paper mill received predictive test results indicating that Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) limits for permitted discharge from the wastewater treatment pond into the Pearl River were exceeded after an upset  condition at the mill and subsequently confirmed reports of a fish kill on the Pearl River (the Bogalusa Incident). Temple-Inland initiated a full mill shut down, notified the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality

(LDEQ) of the situation and took corrective actions to restore the water quality of the river. On September 2, 2011, Bogalusa mill operations were restarted upon receiving approval from the LDEQ. The LDEQ, the Mississippi DEQ, and other regulatory agencies in those states have each given notice of intent to levy penalties and recover  restitution damages resulting from the Bogalusa Incident. Temple-Inland settled for a total of approximately

$1 million

the known claims of various Mississippi regulatory agencies and the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF). In September 2012, the settlement with the LDWF for restitution damages related to the Bogalusa Incident was vacated by a state district court. However, on January 15, 2013, the state Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision, upheld the validity of the LDWF settlement and dismissed the underlying lawsuit. On February 14, 2013, the plaintiff appealed the Court of Appeals' decision to the Louisiana Supreme Court. The Company continue's to believe the settlement is valid and will vigorously defend our position. The LDEQ has not yet levied a civil enforcement penalty. Such a penalty is expected, however, and is likely to exceed

$1 million

, but is not expected to be material. A plea agreement has been reached with the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Orleans as a result of a federal criminal investigation into the Bogalusa Incident. Pursuant to the plea agreement, on February 6, 2013, Temple-Inland subsidiary, TIN Inc., pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to a misdemeanor violation of the Clean Water Act and a misdemeanor violation of the National Wildlife Refuge statute. The plea agreement, which remains subject to court approval, provides for a financial penalty, which is not material, and a two-year corporate probation period for TIN Inc.

Temple-Inland (or its affiliates) is a defendant in


civil lawsuits in Louisiana and Mississippi related to the Bogalusa Incident.

Fifteen

of these civil cases were filed in Louisiana state court shortly after the incident and have been removed and consolidated in an action pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana along with a civil case originally filed in that court. During August 2012, an additional


causes of action were filed in federal or state court in Mississippi and Louisiana. In October 2012, International Paper and the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee, the group of attorneys appointed by the Louisiana federal court to organize and coordinate the efforts of all the plaintiffs in this litigation, reached a tentative understanding on key structural terms and an amount for resolution of the litigation. Preliminary approval for the proposed class action settlement was granted in December 2012. In the interim, all civil litigation arising out of the August 2011 discharge has been stayed. We do not believe that a material loss is probable in this litigation.



LEGAL PROCEEEDINGS

In September 2010,

eight

containerboard producers, including International Paper and Temple-Inland, were named as defendants in a purported class action complaint that alleged a civil violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The suit is captioned

Kleen Products LLC v. Packaging Corp. of America (N.D. Ill.)

. The complaint alleges that the defendants, beginning in August 2005 through November 2010, conspired to limit the supply and thereby increase prices of containerboard products. The alleged class is all persons who purchased containerboard products directly from any defendant for use or delivery in the United States during the period August 2005 to the present. The complaint seeks to recover an unspecified amount of treble actual damages and attorney’s fees on behalf of the purported class.

Four

similar complaints were filed and have been consolidated in the Northern District of Illinois. Moreover, in January 2011, International Paper was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in state court in Cocke County, Tennessee alleging that International Paper violated Tennessee law by conspiring to limit the supply and fix the prices of containerboard from mid-2005 to the present. Plaintiffs in the state court action seek certification of a class of Tennessee indirect purchasers of containerboard products, damages and costs, including attorneys’ fees. The Company disputes the allegations made and intends to vigorously defend each action. However, because both actions are in the preliminary stages, we are unable to predict an outcome or estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.

Temple-Inland was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in August 2011 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas captioned

Tepper v. Temple-Inland Inc.

This lawsuit was brought by the liquidation trustee for Guaranty Financial Group, Inc., Temple-Inland’s former financial services business which was spun off by Temple-Inland in 2007, on behalf of certain creditors of the business. The lawsuit alleged, among other things, that Temple-Inland and certain of its affiliates, officers, and directors caused the failure of Guaranty Financial Group and its wholly-owned subsidiary Guaranty Bank and asserted various claims related to the failure. In October 2012, the Company entered into a settlement with the liquidation trustee and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to resolve this litigation. The settlement, which has been approved by the bankruptcy court, resolved all claims related to the spin-off and subsequent failure of Guaranty Bank that have been or could be asserted by the trustee or the FDIC, in its capacity as Receiver of  Guaranty Bank, against Temple-Inland and its affiliates or any of its former officers, directors or employees. In exchange for this full release from liability, Temple-Inland agreed to release certain bankruptcy-related claims it and other defendants asserted in the Guaranty Financial Group bankruptcy, and to make

$80 million

in

payments (

$38 million

to the trustee and

$42 million

to the FDIC) (the Settlement Amount), a portion of which will be tax deductible. In December 2012, the settlement closed and the Settlement Amount was paid and releases were exchanged. In anticipation of this settlement and based on a May 2012 preliminary settlement agreement with the liquidation trustee, in the second quarter of 2012, the Company established a purchase price accounting reserve relating to this matter in this same amount. As noted below and as previously reported, the Company is seeking to recover a portion of this settlement amount from insurers.

Temple-Inland is a defendant in a lawsuit captioned

North Port Firefighters’ Pension v. Temple-Inland Inc.

, filed in November 2011 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas and subsequently amended. The lawsuit alleges a class action against Temple-Inland and certain individual defendants contending that Temple-Inland misrepresented the financial condition of Guaranty Financial Group during the period December 12, 2007 through August 24, 2009. Temple-Inland distributed the stock of Guaranty Financial Group to its shareholders on December 28, 2007, after which Guaranty Financial Group was an independent, publicly held company. The action is pled as a securities claim on behalf of persons who acquired Guaranty Financial Group stock during the putative class period. Although focused chiefly on statements made by Guaranty Financial Group to its shareholders after it was an independent, publicly held company, the action repeats many of the same allegations of fact made in the Tepper litigation. On June 20, 2012, all defendants in the lawsuit filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion is fully briefed and the Company is awaiting a decision from the court. The Company believes the claims made against Temple-Inland in the North Port lawsuit are without merit, and the Company intends to defend them vigorously. The lawsuit is in its preliminary stages, and thus the Company believes it is premature to predict the outcome or to estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, which may be incurred.

Each of the individual defendants in both the Tepper litigation and the North Port litigation has requested advancement of their costs of defense from Temple-Inland and has asserted a right to indemnification by Temple-Inland. The Company believes that all or part of these defense costs, a portion of the settlement amount in the Tepper litigation and any potential damages awarded against the individual defendants in the North Port litigation and covered by any Temple-Inland indemnity would be covered losses under Temple-Inland’s directors and officers insurance. The carriers under the applicable policies have been notified of the claims and each has responded with a reservation of rights letter.



The Company is currently being challenged by Brazilian tax authorities concerning the statute of limitations related to the use of certain tax credits. The Company is appealing an unfavorable March 2012 administrative court ruling. The potential loss to the Company in the event of a final unfavorable outcome is approximately

$31 million

.

The Company is involved in various other inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation relating to environmental and safety matters, contracts, sales of property, intellectual property, personal injury, labor and employment and other matters, some of which allege substantial monetary damages. While any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty, the Company believes that the outcome of any of the lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened or all of them combined (other than those that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature) will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 11 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARIES

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

In connection with the 2006 sale of approximately

5.6 million

acres of forestlands, International Paper received installment notes (the Timber Notes) totaling approximately

$4.8 billion

. The Timber Notes, which do not require principal payments prior to their August 2016 maturity, are supported by irrevocable letters of credit obtained by the buyers of the forestlands.

During 2006, International Paper contributed the Timber Notes to newly formed entities (the Borrower Entities) in exchange for Class A and Class B interests in these entities. Subsequently, International Paper contributed its

$200 million

Class A interests in the Borrower Entities, along with approximately

$400 million

of International Paper promissory notes, to other newly formed entities (the Investor Entities, and together with the Borrower Entities, the Entities) in exchange for Class A and Class B interests in these entities, and simultaneously sold its Class A interest in the Investor Entities to a third party investor. As a result, at December 31, 2006, International Paper held Class B interests in the Borrower Entities and Class B interests in the Investor Entities valued at approximately

$5.0 billion

. International Paper did not provide any financial support that was not previously contractually required for the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


or


.

Following the 2006 sale of forestlands and creation of the Entities discussed above, the Timber Notes were used as collateral for borrowings from third party lenders, which effectively monetized the Timber Notes.

Provisions of certain loan agreements require any bank issuing letters of credit supporting the Timber Notes to maintain a credit rating above a specified threshold. In the event the credit rating of a letter of credit bank is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of

credit must

be replaced within

60 days

by letters of credit from a qualifying institution, or for one letter of credit bank, collateral must be posted. The Company, retained to provide management services for the third-party entities that hold the Timber Notes, has, as required by the loan agreements, successfully replaced banks that fell below the specified threshold or obtained a waiver as further discussed below.

Also during 2006, the Entities acquired approximately

$4.8 billion

of International Paper debt obligations for cash, resulting in a total of approximately

$5.2 billion

of International Paper debt obligations held by the Entities at December 31, 2006. The various agreements entered into in connection with these transactions provide that International Paper has, and intends to effect, a legal right to offset its obligation under these debt instruments with its investments in the Entities. Accordingly, for financial reporting purposes, International Paper has offset approximately

$5.2 billion

of Class B interests in the Entities against

$5.3 billion

and

$5.2 billion

of International Paper debt obligations held by these Entities at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively. Despite the offset treatment, these remain debt obligations of International Paper. Remaining borrowings of

$79 million

and

$92 million

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively, are included in floating rate notes due 2012 – 2017 in the summary of long-term debt in Note 12. Additional debt related to the above transaction of

$79 million

and

$38 million

is included in short-term notes in the summary of long-term debt in Note 12 at December 31,


and


, respectively.

On February 5, 2010, Moody’s Investor Services reduced its credit rating of senior unsecured long-term debt of the Royal Bank of Scotland N.V. (formerly ABN AMRO Bank N.V.), which issued letters of credit that support

$1.4 billion

of the Timber Notes, below the specified threshold. The letters of credit were successfully replaced by another qualifying institution.

On October 7, 2011, Moody’s Investor Services reduced its credit rating of senior unsecured long-term debt of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, which issued letters of credit that support

$1.6 billion

of the Timber Notes, below the specified threshold. Letters of credit worth

$842 million

were successfully replaced by other qualifying institutions. Fees of

$5 million

were incurred in connection with this replacement. The Company and third-party managing member instituted a replacement waiver for the remaining

$797 million

. On July 25, 2012, these letters of credit were successfully replaced by another qualifying institution.



In the event  the credit rating of the letter of credit bank is downgraded below a specified threshold, the new bank is required to provide credit support for its obligation. Fees of

$5 million

were incurred in connection with this replacement.

On November 29, 2011, Standard and Poor's reduced its credit rating of senior unsecured long-term debt of Lloyds TSB Bank Plc, which issued letters of credit that support

$1.2 billion

of the Timber Notes, below the specified threshold. The letters of credit were successfully replaced by another qualifying institution. Fees of

$4 million

were incurred in connection with this replacement.

On January 23, 2012, Standard and Poor's reduced its credit rating of senior unsecured long-term debt of Société Générale SA, which issued letters of credit that support

$666 million

of the Timber Notes, below the specified threshold. The letters of credit were successfully replaced by another qualifying institution.  Fees of

$5 million

were incurred in connection with this replacement.

On June 21, 2012, Moody's Investor Services reduced its credit rating of senior unsecured long-term debt of BNP Paribas, which issued letters of credit that support

$707 million

of Timber Notes, below the specified threshold. On December 19, 2012, the Company and the third-party managing member agreed to a continuing replacement waiver for these letters of credit, terminable upon

30 days

notice.

Activity between the Company and the Entities was as follows:

(a)

The net expense related to the Company’s interest in the Entities is included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations, as International Paper has and intends to effect its legal right to offset as discussed above.

(b)

The cash receipts are equity distributions from the Entities to International Paper.

(c)

The semi-annual payments are related to interest on the associated debt obligations discussed above.

Based on an analysis of the Entities discussed above under guidance that considers the potential magnitude of the variability in the structures and which party has a controlling financial interest, International Paper determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the Entities, and therefore, should not consolidate its investments in these entities. It was also determined that the source of variability in the structure is the value of the Timber Notes, the assets most significantly

impacting the structure’s economic performance. The credit quality of the Timber Notes is supported by irrevocable letters of credit obtained by third-party buyers which are

100%

cash collateralized. International Paper analyzed which party has control over the economic performance of each entity, and concluded International Paper does not have control over significant decisions surrounding the Timber Notes and letters of credit and therefore is not the primary beneficiary. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss equals the value of the Timber Notes; however, an analysis performed by the Company concluded the likelihood of this exposure is remote.

International Paper also held variable interests in two financing entities that were used to monetize long-term notes received from the sale of forestlands in 2001 and 2002. International Paper transferred notes (the Monetized Notes, with an original maturity of


years from inception) and cash of approximately

$1.0 billion

to these entities in exchange for preferred interests, and accounted for the transfers as a sale of the notes with no associated gain or loss. In the same period, the entities acquired approximately

$1.0 billion

of International Paper debt obligations for cash. International Paper has no obligation to make any further capital contributions to these entities and did not provide any financial support that was not previously contractually required during the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


or


.

Activity between the Company and the 2001 financing entities was as follows:

(a)

The net expense related to the Company’s interest in the 2001 financing entities is included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations, as International Paper has and intends to effect its legal right to offset as discussed above.

(b)

The cash receipts are equity distributions from the 2001 financing entities to International Paper.

(c)

The cash payments are related to interest on the associated debt obligations discussed above.

The 2001 Monetized Notes of

$499 million

matured on

March 16, 2011

. Following their maturity, International Paper purchased the Class A preferred interest in the 2001 financing entities from an external third-party for

$21 million

. As a result of the purchase, effective March 16, 2011, International Paper owned

100%

of the 2001 financing entities. Based on an analysis performed by the Company after the purchase, under guidance that considers the potential magnitude of the variability in the structure and which party has a controlling financial interest, International Paper



determined that it was the primary beneficiary of the 2001 financing entities and thus consolidated the entities effective

March 16, 2011

. Effective April 30, 2011, International Paper liquidated its interest in the 2001 financing entities.

Activity between the Company and the 2002 financing entities was as follows:

(a)

The revenue is included in Equity earnings (loss), net of tax in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

(b)

The expense is included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

(c)

The cash receipts are equity distributions from the 2002 financing entities to International Paper and cash receipts from the maturity of the 2002 Monetized Notes.

(d)

The cash payments include both interest and principal on the associated debt obligations.

On May 31, 2011, the third-party equity holder of the 2002 financing entities retired its Class A interest in the entities for

$51 million

. As a result of the retirement, effective May 31, 2011, International Paper owned

100%

of the 2002 financing entities. Based on an analysis performed by the Company after the retirement, under guidance that considers the potential magnitude of the variability in the structure and which party has controlling financial interest, International Paper determined that it was the primary beneficiary of the 2002 financing entities and thus consolidated the entities effective May 31, 2011.

During the year ended

December 31, 2011

approximately

$191 million

of the 2002 Monetized Notes matured. Outstanding debt related to these entities of

$158 million

is included in floating rate notes due 2011 – 2017 in the summary of long-term debt in Note 12 at

December 31, 2011

. As of May 31, 2012, this debt had been repaid.

During the year ended December 31, 2012,

$252 million

of the 2002 Monetized Notes matured. As of result of these maturities, Accounts and notes receivable decreased

$252 million

and Notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt decreased

$158 million

. Deferred tax liabilities associated with the 2002 forestland installment sales decreased

$67 million

. Effective June 1, 2012, International Paper liquidated its interest in the 2002 financing entities.

The use of the above entities facilitated the monetization of the credit enhanced Timber and Monetized Notes in a cost effective manner by increasing the borrowing capacity and lowering the interest rate while continuing to preserve the tax deferral

that resulted from the forestlands installment sales and the offset accounting treatment described above.

In connection with the acquisition of Temple-Inland in February 2012, two special purpose entities became wholly-owned subsidiaries of International Paper.

In October 2007, Temple-Inland sold

1.55 million

acres of timberlands for

$2.38 billion

. The total consideration consisted almost entirely of notes due in 2027 issued by the buyer of the timberlands, which Temple-Inland contributed to two wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities. The notes are shown in Financial assets of special purpose entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are supported by

$2.38 billion

of irrevocable letters of credit issued by three banks, which are required to maintain minimum credit ratings on their long-term debt. In the third quarter of 2012, International Paper completed is preliminary analysis of the acquisition date fair value of the notes and determined it to be

$2.09 billion

. As a result of this analysis, Financial assets of special purposed entities decreased by

$292 million

and Goodwill increased by the same amount. As of

December 31, 2012

, the fair value of the notes was

$2.21 billion

.

In December 2007, Temple-Inland's two wholly-owned special purpose entities borrowed

$2.14 billion

shown in Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The loans are repayable in 2027 and are secured only by the

$2.38 billion

of notes and the irrevocable letters of credit securing the notes and are nonrecourse to the Company. The loan agreements provide that if a credit rating of any of the banks issuing the letters of credit is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of credit issued by that bank must be replaced within

30 days

with letters of credit from another qualifying financial institution. In the third quarter of 2012, International Paper completed its preliminary analysis of the acquisition date fair value of the borrowings and determined it to be

$2.03 billion

. As a result of this analysis, Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities decreased by

$110 million

and Goodwill decreased by the same amount. As of

December 31, 2012

, the fair value of this debt was

$2.12 billion

.

The buyer of the Temple-Inland timberland issued the

$2.38 billion

in notes from its wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities. The buyer's special purpose entities held the timberlands from the transaction date until November 2008, at which time the timberlands were transferred out of the buyer's special purpose entities. Due to the transfer of the timberlands, Temple-Inland evaluated the buyer's special purpose entities and determined that they were variable interest entities and that Temple-Inland was the primary beneficiary. As a result, in 2008, Temple-Inland



began consolidating the buyer's special purpose entities.

On January 23, 2012, Standard and Poor's reduced its credit rating of senior unsecured long-term debt of Société Générale SA, which issued letters of credit that support

$506 million

of the 2007 Monetized Notes, below the specific threshold. These letters of credit were successfully replaced by another qualifying institution. Fees of

$2 million

were incurred in connection with this replacement.

On June 21, 2012, Moody's Investor Services reduced its credit rating of senior unsecured long-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC, which issued letters of credit that support approximately

$500 million

of the 2007 Monetized Notes, below the specified threshold. These letters of credit were successfully replaced by another qualifying institution. Fees of

$6 million

were incurred in connection with this replacement.

Activity between the Company and the 2007 financing entities was as follows:

(a)

The revenue is included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and includes

$17 million

of accretion income for the amortization of the purchase accounting adjustment of the Financial assets of special purpose entities.

(b)

The expense is included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and includes

$6 million

of accretion expense for the amortization of the purchase accounting adjustment on the Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities.

(c)

The cash receipts are interest received on the Financial assets of special purpose entities.

(d)

The cash payments are interest paid on Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities.

Based on the analysis performed by the Company after the purchase of Temple-Inland and completed in the third quarter of 2012, under guidance that considers the potential magnitude of the variability in the structure and which party has a controlling financial interest, International Paper determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of the buyer's special purpose entities that purchased the timberlands from Temple-Inland and therefore, should not consolidate the buyer's special purpose entities financial results as was historically shown by Temple-Inland.

PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARIES

In March 2003, Southeast Timber, Inc. (Southeast Timber), a consolidated subsidiary of International Paper, issued

$150 million

of preferred securities to a private investor with future dividend payments based

on LIBOR. Southeast Timber, which through a subsidiary initially held approximately

1.50 million

acres of forestlands in the southern United States, was International Paper’s primary vehicle for sales of southern forestlands. As of

December 31, 2012

, substantially all of these forestlands have been sold. These preferred securities may be put back to International Paper by the private investor upon the occurrence of certain events, and have a liquidation preference that approximates their face amount. The

$150 million

preferred third-party interest is included in Noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Distributions paid to the third-party investor were

$6 million

,

$5 million

and

$5 million

in


,


and


, respectively. The expense related to these preferred securities is shown in Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

NOTE 12 DEBT AND LINES OF CREDIT

In February 2012, International Paper issued a

$1.2 billion

term loan with an initial interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of


basis points that varies depending on the credit rating of the Company and a

$200 million

term loan with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of


basis points, both with maturity dates in


. The proceeds from these borrowings were used, along with available cash, to fund the acquisition of Temple-Inland. During 2012, International Paper fully repaid the

$1.2 billion

term loan.

Amounts related to early debt extinguishment during the years ended

December 31, 2012

at

December 31, 2012

and

$11.2 billion

at

December 31, 2011

.

In addition to the long-term debt obligations shown above, International Paper has

$5.3 billion

of debt obligations payable to non-consolidated variable interest entities having principal payments of

$5.3 billion

due in 2016, for which International Paper has, and intends to effect, a legal right to offset these obligations with Class B interests held in the entities. Accordingly, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, International Paper has offset the

$5.3 billion

of debt obligations with

$5.2 billion

of Class B interests in these entities as of

December 31, 2012

(see Note 11). Total maturities of long-term debt over the next five years are


–

$444 million

;


–

$708 million

;


–

$479 million

;

$571 million

; and


–

$216 million

At

December 31, 2012

, International Paper’s contractually committed credit facilities (the Agreements) totaled

$2.5 billion

. The Agreements

generally provide for interest rates at a floating rate index plus a pre-determined margin dependent upon International Paper’s credit rating. The Agreements include a

$1.5 billion

contractually committed bank facility that expires in

August 2016

and has a facility fee of

0.175%

payable quarterly. The Agreements also include up to

$1.0 billion

of commercial paper-based financings based on eligible receivables balances (

$1.0 billion

available as of

December 31, 2012

) under a receivables securitization program. On January 9, 2013, the Company amended the receivables securitization program to extend the maturity date from

January 2013

to

January 2014

. The amended agreement has a facility fee of

0.35%

payable monthly. At December 31, 2012, there were no borrowings under either the bank facility or receivables securitization program.  In November 2012, International Paper terminated the

$250 million

receivable securitization facility previously acquired from Temple-Inland.

Maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of International Paper’s financing strategy. At

December 31, 2012

, the Company held long-term credit ratings of BBB (stable outlook) and Baa3 (stable outlook) by S&P and Moody’s, respectively.

NOTE 13 DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

International Paper periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and currency risks. International Paper does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. For hedges that meet the hedge accounting criteria, International Paper, at inception, formally designates and documents the instrument as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge of a specific underlying exposure.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount.

Interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in interest expense. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is reported in Accumulated other



comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. The ineffective portion for both cash flow and fair value hedges, which is not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

We manufacture and sell our products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The purpose of our foreign currency hedging program is to manage the volatility associated with the changes in exchange rates.

To manage this exchange rate risk, we have historically utilized a combination of forward contracts, options and currency swaps. Contracts that qualify are designated as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion, which is not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings.

In the second quarter of 2012, the Company added zero-cost collar option contracts to its portfolio to manage its exposure to U.S. dollar / Brazilian real exchange rates.  These zero-cost collar instruments qualify as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted transactions denominated in U.S. dollars.  The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings.  The ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings.

The change in value of certain non-qualifying instruments used to manage foreign exchange exposure of intercompany financing transactions and certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation is immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure.

COMMODITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Certain raw materials used in our production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility in earnings due to price fluctuations, we may utilize swap contracts. These contracts are designated as cash flow

hedges of forecasted commodity purchases. The effective portion of the changes in fair value for these instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective and non-qualifying portions, which are not material for any year presented, are immediately recognized in earnings.

The notional amounts of qualifying and non-qualifying instruments used in hedging transactions were as follows:

(a)

These contracts had maturities of

three

years or less as of

December 31, 2012

.

(b)

Includes

$150 million

floating-to-fixed interest rate swap notional to offset the embedded derivative.

The following table shows gains or losses recognized in AOCI, net of tax, related to derivative instruments:

During the next

12 months

, the amount of the

December 31, 2012

AOCI balance, after tax, that is expected to be reclassified to earnings is a loss of $

9 million

.



The amounts of gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statement of operations on qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions were as follows:

(a)

Premium costs of

$5 million

in connection with the acquisition of APPM are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

(b)

Includes a gain of

$22 million

due to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements of

$1.0 billion

floating-to-fixed notional and an offsetting

$1.0 billion

fixed-to-floating notional that did not qualify as hedges under the accounting guidance and matured in September 2010.

The following activity is related to fully effective interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges:

(a)

Fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps were effective when issued and were terminated in the third quarter of 2011.

(b)

Terminations of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps were not in connection with early debt retirements. The resulting

$27 million

gain was deferred and recorded in Long-term debt and is being amortized as an adjustment of Interest expense over the life of the respective underlying debt through June 2014, March 2015 or March 2016.



Fair Value Measurements

International Paper’s financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value consist of derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts, and other financial instruments that are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and currency risks. In addition, a consolidated subsidiary of International Paper has an embedded derivative. For these financial instruments and the embedded derivative, fair value is determined at each balance sheet date using an income approach.

The guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures sets out a fair value hierarchy that groups fair value measurement inputs into the following three classifications:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets.

Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. All of International Paper’s derivative fair value measurements use Level 2 inputs.

Below is a description of the valuation calculation and the inputs used for each class of contract:

Interest Rate Contracts

Interest rate contracts are valued using swap curves obtained from an independent market data provider. The market value of each contract is the sum of the fair value of all future interest payments between the contract counterparties, discounted to present value. The fair value of the future interest payments is determined by comparing the contract rate to the

derived forward interest rate and present valued using the appropriate derived interest rate curve.

Fuel Oil Contracts

Fuel oil contracts are valued using the average of two forward fuel oil curves as quoted by third parties. The fair value of each contract is determined by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the corresponding fuel oil contract and present valued using the appropriate interest rate curve.

Natural Gas Contracts

Natural gas contracts are traded over-the-counter and settled using the NYMEX last day settle price; therefore, forward contracts are valued using the closing prices of the NYMEX natural gas future contracts. The fair value of each contract is determined by comparing the strike price to the closing price of the corresponding natural gas future contract and present valued using the appropriate interest rate curve.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Foreign currency forward contracts are valued using foreign currency forward and interest rate curves obtained from an independent market data provider. The fair value of each contract is determined by comparing the contract rate to the forward rate. The fair value is present valued using the applicable interest rate from an independent market data provider.

Embedded Derivative

Embedded derivatives are valued using a hypothetical interest rate derivative with identical terms. The hypothetical interest rate derivative contracts are fair valued as described above under Interest Rate Contracts.

Since the volume and level of activity of the markets that each of the above contracts are traded in has been normal, the fair value calculations have not been adjusted for inactive markets or disorderly transactions.



The following table provides a summary of the impact of our derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet:

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

International Paper evaluates credit risk by monitoring its exposure with each counterparty to ensure that exposure stays within acceptable policy limits. Credit risk is also mitigated by contractual provisions with the majority of our banks. Most of the contracts include a credit support annex that requires the posting of collateral by the counterparty or International Paper based on each party’s rating and level of exposure. Based on the Company’s current credit rating, the collateral threshold is generally

$10 million

.

If the lower of the Company’s credit rating by Moody’s or S&P were to drop below investment grade, the Company would be required to post collateral for all of its derivatives in a net liability position, although no derivatives would terminate. The fair values of derivative instruments containing credit-risk-related contingent features in a net liability position were

$18 million

as of

December 31, 2012

and

$67 million

as of

December 31, 2011

. The Company was not required to post any collateral as of

December 31, 2012

or


. In addition, existing derivative contracts (except foreign exchange contracts) provide for netting across most derivative positions in the event a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation. International Paper currently does not expect any of the counterparties to default on their obligations.

NOTE 15 RETIREMENT PLANS

International Paper sponsors and maintains the Retirement Plan of International Paper Company (the “Pension Plan”), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides retirement benefits to substantially all U.S. salaried employees and hourly employees (receiving salaried benefits) hired prior to July 1, 2004, and substantially all other U.S. hourly and union employees who work at a participating business unit regardless of hire date. These employees generally are eligible to participate in the Pension Plan upon attaining 21 years of age and completing one year of eligibility service. U.S. salaried employees and hourly employees (receiving salaried benefits) hired after June 30, 2004 are not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan, but receive a company contribution to their individual savings plan accounts (see Other U.S. Plans). The Pension Plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of credited service and either final average earnings (salaried employees and hourly employees receiving salaried benefits), hourly job rates or specified benefit rates (hourly and union employees).

In connection with the Temple-Inland acquisition in February 2012, International Paper assumed administrative responsibility for the Temple-Inland Retirement Plan, a defined benefit plan which covers substantially all employees of Temple-Inland.

The Company also has three unfunded nonqualified defined benefit pension plans: a Pension Restoration Plan available to employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 that provides retirement benefits based on eligible compensation in excess of limits set by the Internal Revenue Service, and two supplemental retirement plans for senior managers (SERP), which is an alternative retirement plan for salaried employees who are senior vice presidents and above or who are designated by the chief executive officer as participants. These nonqualified plans are only funded to the extent of benefits paid, which totaled

$95 million

,

$19 million

and

$37 million

in


,


and


,

respectively, and which are expected to be

$32 million

in


.

Many non-U.S. employees are covered by various retirement benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes.

OBLIGATIONS AND FUNDED STATUS

The following table shows the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets for


and


, and the plans’ funded status. The U.S. combined benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2012

increased by

$3.6 billion

, as a result of a decrease in the discount rate assumption used in computing the estimated benefit obligation as well as the acquisition of Temple-Inland. U.S. plan assets increased by

$1.9 billion

, reflecting the acquisition of the Temple-Inland Retirement Plan, favorable investment results and a

$44 million

voluntary contribution in 2012 offset by benefit payments.



The components of the

$1.2 billion

and

$24 million

increase related to U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, in the amounts recognized in OCI during


consisted of:

The accumulated benefit obligation at

December 31, 2012

and


was

$13.8 billion

and

$10.3 billion

, respectively, for our U.S. defined benefit plans and

$206 million

and

$171 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2012

and


for our non-U.S. defined benefit plans.

The following table summarizes information for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at

December 31, 2012

and


:

ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes. These net gains and losses are recognized prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans (approximately


years as of

December 31, 2012

for the U.S. plans) to the extent that they are not offset by gains in subsequent years. The estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic pension cost for the U.S. plans during the next fiscal year are expected to be

$490 million

and

$34 million

, respectively.

NET PERIODIC PENSION EXPENSE

Service cost is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the plans’ benefit formula to services

rendered by employees during the year. Interest cost represents the increase in the projected benefit obligation, which is a discounted amount, due to the passage of time. The expected return on plan assets reflects the computed amount of current-year earnings from the investment of plan assets using an estimated long-term rate of return.

Net periodic pension expense for qualified and nonqualified U.S. defined benefit plans comprised the following:

The increase in


pension expense reflects a decrease in the discount rate from

5.60%

in


to

5.10%

in


, a lower expected return on assets assumption of

8.00%

in


compared with

8.25%

in


and the acquisition of Temple-Inland.

ASSUMPTIONS

International Paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of December 31 (the measurement date) and considers changes in these long-term factors based upon market conditions and the requirements for employers’ accounting for pensions. These assumptions are used to calculate benefit obligations as of December 31 of the current year and pension expense to be recorded in the following year (i.e., the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2012

was also the discount rate used to determine net pension expense for the


year).

Major actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for our defined benefit plans are presented in the following table:



(a)

Represents the expected rate of return for International Paper's qualified pension plan. The rate for the Temple-Inland Retirement Plan is

5.70%

.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio. Projected rates of return are developed through an asset/liability study in which projected returns for each of the plan’s asset classes are determined after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio is developed considering the effects of active portfolio management and expenses paid from plan assets. The discount rate assumption was determined from a universe of high quality corporate bonds. A settlement portfolio is selected and matched to the present value of the plan’s projected benefit payments. To calculate pension expense for


, the Company will use an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of

8.00%

for the Retirement Plan of International Paper, an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of

5.30%

for the Temple-Inland Retirement Plan, a discount rate of

4.10%

and an assumed rate of compensation increase of

3.75%

. The Company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately

$561 million

for its U.S. defined benefit plans in


, with the increase from expense of

$342 million

in


reflecting a decrease in the discount rate to

4.10%

in


from

5.10%

in


, a lower return on asset assumption for Temple-Inland plan assets to

5.30%

in


from

5.70%

in


, and higher amortization of unrecognized losses.

For non-U.S. pension plans, assumptions reflect economic assumptions applicable to each country.

The following illustrates the effect on pension expense for


of a 25 basis point decrease in the above assumptions:

PLAN ASSETS

International Paper’s Board of Directors has appointed a Fiduciary Review Committee that is responsible for fiduciary oversight of the U.S. Pension Plan, approving investment policy and reviewing the management and control of plan assets. Pension Plan assets are invested to maximize returns within prudent levels of risk. The Pension Plan maintains a strategic asset allocation policy that designates target allocations by asset class. Investments are diversified across classes and within each class to minimize the risk of large losses. Derivatives, including swaps, forward and futures contracts, may be used as asset class substitutes or for hedging or other risk management purposes. Periodic reviews are made of investment policy objectives and investment manager performance. For non-U.S. plans, assets consist principally of common stock and fixed income securities.

International Paper’s U.S. pension allocations by type of fund at December 31, and target allocations were as follows:

The 2012 actual and target allocations shown represent a weighted average of International Paper and Temple-Inland plan assets.

The fair values of International Paper’s pension plan assets at

December 31, 2012

and


by asset class are shown below. Plan assets included an immaterial amount of International Paper common stock at

December 31, 2012

and


. Hedge funds disclosed in the following table are allocated equally between equity and fixed income accounts for target allocation purposes. Cash and cash equivalent portfolios are allocated to the types of account from which they originated.



Equity securities consist primarily of publicly traded U.S. companies and international companies. Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing prices reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.

Fixed income consists of government securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and common collective funds. Government securities are valued by third-party pricing sources. Mortgage-backed security holdings consist primarily of agency-rated holdings. The fair value estimates for mortgage securities are calculated by third-party pricing sources chosen by the custodian’s price matrix. Corporate bonds are valued using either the yields currently

available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or using a discounted cash flows approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks. Common collective funds are valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the measurement date.

Commodities consist of commodity-linked notes and commodity-linked derivatives. Commodities are valued at closing prices determined by calculation agents for outstanding transactions.

Hedge funds are investment structures for managing private, loosely-regulated investment pools that can pursue a diverse array of investment strategies with a wide range of different securities and derivative instruments. These investments are made through funds-of-funds (commingled, multi-manager fund structures) and through direct investments in individual hedge funds. Hedge funds are primarily valued by each fund’s third-party administrator based upon the valuation of the underlying securities and instruments and primarily by applying a market or income valuation methodology as appropriate depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. Funds-of-funds are valued based upon the net asset values of the underlying investments in hedge funds.

Private equity consists of interests in partnerships that invest in U.S. and non-U.S. debt and equity securities. Partnership interests are valued using the most recent general partner statement of fair value, updated for any subsequent partnership interest cash flows.

Real estate includes commercial properties, land and timberland, and generally includes, but is not limited to, retail, office, industrial, multifamily and hotel properties. Real estate fund values are primarily reported by the fund manager and are based on valuation of the underlying investments which include inputs such as cost, discounted cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data.

Derivative investments such as futures, forward contracts, options, and swaps are used to help manage risks. Derivatives are generally employed as asset class substitutes (such as when employed within a portable alpha strategy), for managing asset/liability mismatches, or bona fide hedging or other appropriate risk management purposes. Derivative instruments are generally valued by the investment managers or in certain instances by third-party pricing sources.



The fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) at

December 31, 2012

were as follows:

Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)

FUNDING AND CASH FLOWS

The Company’s funding policy for the Pension Plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans, tax deductibility, cash flow generated by the Company, and other factors. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions. Voluntary contributions totaling

$44 million

,

$300 million

and

$1.15 billion

were made by the Company in


,


and


, respectively. Generally, International Paper’s non-U.S. pension plans are funded using the projected benefit as a target, except in certain countries where funding of benefit plans is not required.

At

December 31, 2012

, projected future pension benefit payments, excluding any termination benefits, were as follows:

OTHER U.S. PLANS

International Paper sponsors the International Paper Company Salaried Savings Plan and the International Paper Company Hourly Savings Plan, both of which are tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) savings plans. Substantially all U.S. salaried and certain hourly

employees are eligible to participate and may make elective deferrals to such plans to save for retirement. International Paper makes matching contributions to participant accounts on a specified percentage of employee deferrals as determined by the provisions of each plan. For eligible employees hired after June 30, 2004, the Company makes Retirement Savings Account contributions equal to a percentage of an eligible employee’s pay. From February 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010, matching contributions to the International Paper Salaried Savings Plan were made in Company stock. Beginning in January 2011, matching contributions to the International Paper Salaried Savings Plan were again made in the form of cash contributions.

In connection with the Temple-Inland acquisition, International Paper acquired two savings plans which were merged into the International Paper savings plans on December 31, 2012.

The Company also sponsors the International Paper Company Deferred Compensation Savings Plan, which is an unfunded nonqualified defined contribution plan. This plan permits eligible employees to continue to make deferrals and receive company matching contributions when their contributions to the International Paper Salaried Savings Plan are stopped due to limitations under U.S. tax law. Participant deferrals and company matching contributions are not invested in a separate trust, but are paid directly from International Paper’s general assets at the time benefits become due and payable.

Company matching contributions to the plans totaled approximately

$122 million

,

$83 million

and

$87



million

for the plan years ending in


,


and


, respectively.

NOTE 16 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

International Paper provides certain retiree health care and life insurance benefits covering certain U.S. salaried and hourly employees. These employees are generally eligible for benefits upon retirement and completion of a specified number of years of creditable service. Excluded from company-provided medical benefits are salaried employees whose age plus years of employment with the Company totaled less than 60 as of January 1, 2004. International Paper does not fund these benefits prior to payment and has the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans in the future.

The components of postretirement benefit expense in


,


and


were as follows:

International Paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of December 31 (the measurement date) and considers changes in these long-term factors based upon market conditions and the requirements of employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions. International Paper's postretirement plan was remeasured on January

31, 2012 due to a negative plan amendment which reduced our obligation by

$29 million

and reduced the 2012 expected benefit cost by

$11 million

.  Temple-Inland's postretirement plan was also remeasured on July 31, 2012 due to a negative plan amendment which reduced the obligation by

$6 million

The weighted average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at

December 31, 2012

and


were as follows:

A 1% increase in the assumed annual health care cost trend rate would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at

December 31, 2012

by approximately

$19 million

. A 1% decrease in the annual trend rate would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at

December 31, 2012

by approximately

$17 million

. The effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1% increase or decrease would be approximately

$1 million

NOTE 17 INCENTIVE PLANS

International Paper currently has an Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP) which, upon the approval by the Company’s shareholders in May 2009, replaced the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (LTICP). The ICP authorizes grants of restricted stock, restricted or deferred stock units, performance awards payable in cash or stock upon the attainment of specified performance goals, dividend equivalents, stock options, stock appreciation rights, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards at the discretion of the Management Development and Compensation

Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) that administers the ICP.  Restricted stock units (RSU’s) were also awarded to certain non-U.S. employees with


and


units outstanding at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively. Additionally, restricted stock, which may be deferred into RSU’s, may be awarded under a Restricted Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors.

STOCK OPTION PROGRAM

International Paper accounts for stock options in accordance with guidance under ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation.” Compensation expense is recorded over the related service period based on the grant-date fair market value. Since all outstanding options were vested as of July 14, 2005, only replacement option grants are expensed. No replacement options were granted in


or


.

During each reporting period, diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “in-the-money” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace. When options are actually exercised, option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share, with no effect on reported earnings. Equity is also increased by the tax benefit that International Paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the employees in their individual tax returns.

Under the program, upon exercise of an option, a replacement option may be granted under certain circumstances with an exercise price equal to the market price at the time of exercise and with a term extending to the expiration date of the original option.

The Company has discontinued the issuance of stock options for all eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. In the United States, the stock option program was replaced with a performance-based restricted share program to more closely tie long-term incentive compensation to Company performance on two key performance drivers: return on investment (ROI) and total shareholder return (TSR).



The following summarizes the status of the Stock Option Program and the changes during the three years ending

December 31, 2012

:

(a)

The table does not include Continuity Award tandem stock options described below. No fair market value is assigned to these options under ASC 718. The tandem restricted shares accompanying these options are expensed over their vesting period.

(b)

The table includes options outstanding under an acquired company plan under which options may no longer be granted.

PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN

Under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), contingent awards of International Paper common stock are granted by the Committee. The PSP awards are earned over a three-year period. For the 2010 and 2011 grants, one-fourth of the award is earned during each twelve-month period, with the final one-fourth segment earned over the full three-year period. Beginning with the 2012 grant, the award is earned evenly over a thirty-six-month period. PSP awards are earned based on the achievement of defined performance rankings of ROI and TSR compared to ROI and TSR peer groups of companies. Awards are weighted

75%

for ROI and

25%

for TSR for all participants except for officers for whom the awards are weighted

50%

for ROI and

50%

for TSR. The ROI component of the PSP awards is valued at the closing stock price on the day prior to the grant date. As the ROI component contains a performance condition, compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period based on the most probable number of awards expected to vest. The TSR component of the PSP awards is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation as the TSR component contains a market condition. The Monte Carlo simulation estimates the fair value of the TSR component based on the expected term of the award, a risk-free rate, expected dividends, and the expected volatility for the Company and its competitors. The expected term is estimated based on the vesting period of the awards, the risk-free rate is based on the

yield on U.S. Treasury securities matching the vesting period, and the volatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility over the expected term.

Beginning with the 2011 PSP, grants are made in performance-based restricted stock units (PSU’s). The PSP will continue to be paid in unrestricted shares of Company stock.

PSP awards issued to certain members of senior management are accounted for as liability awards, which are remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date. The valuation of these PSP liability awards is computed based on the same methodology as the PSP equity awards.

The following table sets forth the assumptions used to determine compensation cost for the market condition component of the PSP plan:

The following summarizes PSP activity for the three years ending

Includes

72,798

shares/units related to retirements or terminations that are held for payout until the end of the performance period.

EXECUTIVE CONTINUITY AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD PROGRAMS

The Executive Continuity Award program provides for the granting of tandem awards of restricted stock and/or nonqualified stock options to key executives. Grants are restricted and awards conditioned on attainment of a specified age. The awarding of a tandem stock option results in the cancellation of the related restricted shares.

The service-based Restricted Stock Award program (RSA), designed for recruitment, retention and special



recognition purposes, also provides for awards of restricted stock to key employees.

NOTE 18 FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA

International Paper’s industry segments, Industrial Packaging, Printing Papers, Consumer Packaging and Distribution Businesses, are consistent with the internal structure used to manage these businesses. Beginning on January 1, 2011, the Forest Products Business is no longer being reported by the Company as a separate industry segment due to the immateriality of the results of the remaining business on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. All segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.

For management purposes, International Paper reports the operating performance of each business based on earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT). Intersegment sales and transfers are recorded at current market prices.

External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper’s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.

The Company also holds a

50%

interest in Ilim that is a separate reportable industry segment. The Company recorded equity earnings, net of taxes, of

$56 million

,

$134 million

and

$102 million

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of

December 31, 2012

, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

December 31, 2012

.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to allow for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors;

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; and

•

provide reasonable assurance as to the detection of fraud.

All internal control systems have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control objectives. The Company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures, contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and is audited by the internal audit function. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

As of

December 31, 2012

, management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In a report included on pages 43 and 44, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2012

.

In making this assessment, we used the criteria described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, with direct access to our Board of Directors through our Audit and Finance Committee, has audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by us. Their report on the consolidated financial statements is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report under the heading “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. Deloitte & Touche LLP has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.



MANAGEMENT’S PROCESS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we followed a comprehensive compliance process across the enterprise to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, engaging employees at all levels of the organization. Our internal control environment includes an enterprise-wide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top.” This is exemplified by our ethics program that includes long-standing principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of our business, which have been distributed to all employees; a toll-free telephone helpline whereby any employee may report suspected violations of law or our policy; and an office of ethics and business practice. The internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel, appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility, dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout the Company, and an extensive program of internal audits with management follow-up. Our Board of Directors, assisted by the Audit and Finance Committee, monitors the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting procedures, the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors, and other matters set forth in its charter. The Committee, which currently consists of four independent directors, meets regularly with representatives of management, and with the independent auditors and the Internal Auditor, with and without management representatives in attendance, to review their activities.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended

December 31, 2012

that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The Company completed the acquisition of Temple-Inland in February 2012. Due to the timing of the acquisition we have excluded Temple-Inland from our evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. For the period ended

December 31, 2012

, Temple-Inland net sales and assets represented approximately 19% of net sales and 25% of total assets.
