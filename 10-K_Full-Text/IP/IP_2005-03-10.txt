and
        Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

From
        2000 through 2004, International Paper’s capital expenditures approximated
        $5.9 billion, excluding mergers and acquisitions. These expenditures reflect
        our continuing efforts to improve product quality and environmental performance,
        lower costs, and improve forestlands. Capital spending for continuing
        operations in 2004 was $1.3 billion and is expected to be approximately
        $1.4 billion in 2005. This amount is below our expected annual depreciation
        and amortization expense of $1.7 billion. You can find more information
        about capital expenditures on page 22 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion
        and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

International
        Paper Company (the “Company” or “International Paper,”
        which may be referred to as “we” or “us”), is a global
        forest products, paper and packaging company that is complemented by an
        extensive North American merchant distribution system, with primary markets
        and manufacturing operations in the United States, Europe, the Pacific
        Rim and South America. We are a New York corporation and were incorporated
        in 1941 as the successor to the New York corporation of the same name
        organized in 1898. Our home page on the Internet is

www.internationalpaper.com.

You can learn more about us by visiting that site.

In
        the United States at December 31, 2004, the Company operated 27 pulp,
        paper and packaging mills, 103 converting and packaging plants, 25 wood
        products facilities, and seven specialty chemicals plants. Production
        facilities at December 31, 2004 in Europe, Asia, Latin America and South
        America included seven pulp, paper and packaging mills, 42 converting
        and packaging plants, one wood products facility, two specialty panels
        and laminated products plants and six specialty chemicals plants. We distribute
        printing, packaging, graphic arts, maintenance and industrial products
        principally through over 286 distribution branches located primarily in
        the United States. At December 31, 2004, we owned or managed approximately
        6.8 million acres of forestlands in the United States, mostly in the South,
        approximately 1.2 million acres in Brazil and had, through licenses and
        forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government-owned forestlands
        in Russia. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are
        likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to available industry
        capacity and general economic conditions.

Carter
        Holt Harvey Limited, a New Zealand company that is listed on the New Zealand
        and Australian stock exchanges and is approximately 50.5% owned by International
        Paper, operates four mills producing pulp, paper and packaging products,
        17 converting and packaging plants and 82 wood products manufacturing
        and distribution facilities, primarily in New Zealand, Australia and,
        through the 2004 acquisition of Plantation Timber Products, in China.
        In New Zealand, Carter Holt Harvey owns approximately 785,000 acres of
        forestlands.

For
        management and financial reporting purposes, our businesses are separated
        into six segments: Printing

Papers; Industrial
        and Consumer Packaging; Distribution; Forest Products; Carter
        Holt Harvey; and Specialty Businesses and Other. A description of
        these business segments can be found on pages 15 through 17 of Item 7.

orestlands

The principal raw material used by International Paper is wood in various forms. As of December 31, 2004, the Company or its subsidiaries owned or managed approximately 6.8 million acres of forestlands in the United States, 1.2 million acres in Brazil and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government-owned forestlands in Russia. An additional 785,000 acres of forestlands in New Zealand were held through Carter Holt Harvey, a consolidated subsidiary of International Paper.

During 2004, the Company’s U.S. forestlands supplied 14.7 million tons of roundwood to its U.S. facilities, representing 23% of its wood fiber requirements. The balance was acquired from other private industrial and nonindustrial forestland owners, with only an insignificant amount coming from public lands of the United States government. In addition, in 2004, 3.8 million tons of wood were sold to other users.

As
        one of the largest private landowners in the world, International Paper
        employs professional foresters and wildlife biologists to manage our forestlands
        with great care


in compliance with the rigorous standards of the Sustainable Forestry
        Initiative program (SFI®). SFI® includes an independent certification
        system to ensure the sustainable planting, growing and harvesting of trees
        while protecting wildlife, plants, soil, water and air quality. All of
        our U.S. forestlands are certified as complying with SFI® standards
        by an independent third party, and most of our forestlands outside of
        the United States comply with similar local or regional sustainable forestry
        programs as well.

        Summary

In
        Millions




International
        Paper benefited from a strong economy in 2004 as demand for paper and
        packaging products was improved from 2003. Overall average price realizations
        were up year over year across all our major product lines except for European
        paper products where a strong Euro attracted imports. Our total industry
        segment operating profits were up from 2003 reflecting the higher average
        prices and improved shipments combined with benefits from cost reduction
        initiatives and a more favorable product mix. These positive effects were
        partially offset by higher input costs, including wood, energy and chemical
        costs.

Looking
        forward to 2005, we expect demand in the first quarter to be somewhat
        positive, although this is a seasonally slow period for many of our businesses.
        Overall, demand remains solid in the United States and Europe, with strong
        order backlogs in our coated papers and bleached board businesses. Containerboard
        and box orders are also good. Uncoated papers’ backlogs were below
        prior year levels, but are improving as the first quarter progresses.
        Our average price realizations for most paper and packaging products began
        the year well above 2004 levels reflecting the realization of previously
        announced price increases. Raw material costs, especially wood, polyethylene
        and chemical costs, are expected to increase in early 2005, although energy
        costs should be flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition,
        pension and other benefit related costs, plus supply chain expenses are
        expected to be higher in 2005. However, interest costs will decline due
        to debt repayments in 2004 and the 2005 first quarter.

Results
        of Operations

Industry
        segment operating profits are used by International Paper’s management
        to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes
        that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating
        efficiencies, prices and volumes. Industry segment operating profits are
        defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest, interest expense,
        corporate items and corporate special items. Industry segment operating
        profits are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-GAAP
        financial measure, and are not GAAP alternatives to net income or any
        other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally
        accepted in the United States. International Paper operates in six segments:
        Printing Papers, Industrial and Consumer Packaging, Distribution, Forest
        Products, Carter Holt Harvey, and Specialty Businesses and Other.

Industry
        segment operating profits were $315 million higher in 2004 due principally
        to improved sales volume ($263 million), higher average prices ($201 million),
        and the effect of cost reduction initiatives, improved operating performance
        and a more favorable product mix ($186 million), all partially offset
        by the impact of higher energy and raw material costs ($192 million),
        lower earnings from land sales ($95 million), the impact of hurricanes
        in the South ($18 million), and foreign currency translation rates and
        other items ($30 million).

The
        principal changes by segment were as follows: Printing Papers’ profits
        were $119 million higher as increased sales volume, improved sales mix
        and lower operating and overhead costs more than offset higher energy
        and raw material costs. Industrial and Consumer Packaging’s profits
        were up $92 million. Higher average sales prices and volumes, improved
        product mix, and reduced overhead costs and improved operations more than
        offset the effect of higher energy and raw material costs. Forest Products’
        profit was $73 million higher. Higher average prices for wood products
        more than offset the effect of lower harvest volumes and lower earnings
        from land sales.


Corporate
        items of $469 million net expense in 2004 was slightly higher than the
        $466 million net expense in 2003, due to higher pension and supply chain
        initiative costs, increased inventory-related costs and lower gains on
        energy hedging transactions, offset in part by lower administrative overhead
        and benefit-related costs.

Corporate special items, including restructuring and other charges, gains/losses on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale, insurance recoveries and reversals of reserves no longer required, declined to $188 million from $290 million in 2003 and from $586 million in 2002. The decline in 2004 reflects lower restructuring charges that relate to excess capacity shutdowns and organizational restructuring programs, and insurance recoveries relating to hardboard siding and roofing matters.

Interest expense, net, decreased to $743 million from $772 million in 2003 and $785 million in 2002. The decline in 2004 compared with both 2003 and 2002 reflects the lower average interest rates from the refinancing of high coupon rate debt, and higher interest income at Carter Holt Harvey.

The income tax provision of $206 million includes a $41 million tax benefit related to 2004 special items. The $113 million income tax benefit in 2003 included $231 million of benefits for special items occurring in 2003. The $72 million benefit in 2002 also reflected adjustments for special tax items.

During 2004, International Paper completed the sale of its Weldwood of Canada Limited business in the fourth quarter and Carter Holt Harvey completed the sale of its Tissue business in the second quarter. As a result of these transactions, the operating results of these businesses and the gain or loss on the sales are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Accounting changes included a charge of $13 million in 2003 for the adoption of new accounting pronouncements, and a $1.2 billion charge in 2002 for the adoption of the new goodwill accounting standard.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

For the year ended December 31, 2004, International Paper generated $2.4 billion of operating cash flow, up from $1.8 billion in 2003. Capital spending from continuing operations for the year totaled $1.3 billion, or 81% of depreciation and amortization expense. We repaid approximately $900 million of debt during the year, including various higher coupon rate debt, that will result in lower interest charges in future years. Our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $3.2 billion of unused, committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future short-

term liquidity requirements. Maintaining an investment grade credit rating for our long-term debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy.

Our focus in 2005 will be to continue to maximize our financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while further reducing future interest expense through the repayment or refinancing of high coupon rate debt, with a target of reducing consolidated debt to approximately $12 billion by the end of 2006.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates

Accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial position, and that can require judgments by management in their application, include accounting for contingent liabilities, impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes.

Pension
        expenses for our U.S. plans increased to $111 million in 2004 from $60
        million in 2003 due principally to increased amortization of unrecognized
        actuarial losses and a reduction in the assumed discount rate. A further
        increase of approximately $100 million is expected in 2005, also due to
        an increase in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses, a further
        reduction in the assumed discount rate, and a decrease in the expected
        return on plan assets to 8.50% from 8.75% in 2004. Our pension funding
        policy continues to be to fully fund actuarially determined costs, generally
        equal to the minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income
        Security Act (ERISA). Unless investment performance is negative or changes
        are made to our funding policy, it is unlikely that any contributions
        to our U.S. qualified plan will be required before 2007.

Recent Accounting Developments

Several new accounting standards and interpretations were released that are effective in either 2004 or 2005. The revised standard on share-based payment that will be effective in the third quarter of 2005 will require recognition of compensation cost for any outstanding option grants that are unvested at June 30, 2005, as well as reload grants. While the exact impact will depend upon the number of unvested options at that time, this standard could increase compensation expense by approximately $20 million in both 2005 and 2006, with no significant impact in subsequent years. Accounting guidance was also issued addressing accounting and disclosure for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We have started an evaluation of the effects of this provision, but do not expect to complete this evaluation until the second
quarter of 2005.


Legal

Payments relating to exterior siding and roofing class action settlements continue to be in line with projections made in 2002. Federal and state court antitrust cases relating to alleged price fixing in the sale of high-pressure laminates were settled in 2004 for a total of $38.5 million. The Company is defending opt-out cases related to a settled class action brought by purchasers of corrugated sheets and containers. Additional information on these matters is included in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

C

orporate Overview

While
        the operating results for International Paper’s various business
        segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes
        in International Paper’s operating results are closely tied to changes
        in general economic conditions in the United States, Europe and Asia.
        Factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial non-durable
        goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising
        activity, white-collar employment levels, new home construction and repair
        and remodeling activity, and movements in currency exchange rates. Product
        prices also tend to follow general economic trends, and are also affected
        by inventory levels, currency movements and changes in worldwide operating
        rates. In addition to these revenue-related factors, net earnings are
        impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include
        changes in raw material costs, principally wood fiber and chemical costs,
        energy costs, salary and benefits costs, including pensions, and manufacturing
        conversion costs.

The following is a discussion of International Paper’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, and the major factors affecting these results compared to 2003 and 2002.

R

esults of Operations

For the year ended December 31, 2004, International Paper reported net sales of $25.5 billion, compared with $24.0 billion in 2003 and $23.9 billion in 2002. International net sales (including U.S. exports) totaled $7.9 billion, or 31% of  total sales in 2004. This compares to international net sales of $7.2 billion in 2003 and $6.4 billion in 2002.

Full year 2004 results totaled a net loss of $35 million ($0.07 per share basic and diluted), compared with net income of $302 million ($0.63 per share basic and diluted) in 2003 and a net loss of $880 million ($1.83 per share basic, $1.82 per share diluted) in 2002 and amounts include results of discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes.

Earnings from continuing operations in 2004 were $478 million compared with $294 million in 2003 and $260 million in 2002. Earnings in 2004 benefited from higher sales volumes, higher average sales prices, cost reduction initiatives, improved mill operations and lower interest expense. These factors more than offset the negative impacts of increased energy and wood fiber costs, lower earnings from land sales, a higher effective tax rate, increased special charges and the impact of the hurricanes in the South. See Industry Segment Results on pages 17 through 21 for a discussion of the impact of these factors by segment.

Corporate Items and Interest Expense

Minority interest expense, net of taxes, decreased to $62 million in 2004 compared with $111 million in 2003 and $118 million in 2002. The decreases in 2004 and 2003 reflect a reduction in minority interest related to preferred securities that were replaced by debt obligations in the second half of 2003. This decrease was partially offset in 2004 by higher earnings at Carter Holt Harvey.

Interest expense, net, decreased to $743 million compared with $772 million in 2003 and $785 million in 2002. The decline reflects lower interest rates from the refinancing of high coupon debt, the impact of interest rate swaps, and, in 2004, higher interest income from Carter Holt Harvey, net of the additional expense of $36 million for the preferred debt securities discussed above.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, corporate items totaled $469 million compared with $466 million of expense in 2003 and $253 million in 2002. The increased expense in 2004 compared with 2003 is due to higher pension, inventory-related and supply chain initiative costs, and lower gains on energy hedging transactions, offset in part by reduced administrative overhead costs. Higher pension, inventory-related and supply chain costs were also factors in 2003 as compared with 2002, which also included income from an insurance company demutualization and foreign exchange gains.

Our supply chain project, begun in late 2002, is a corporate- wide initiative to improve customer service capabilities and implement “best practice” supply chain business processes for order management, supply and demand planning, product scheduling and tracking, transportation and warehousing, and procurement. Expenses related to this program in 2005, should be approximately $100 million above the 2004 level of $84 million. The associated benefits are reflected in business earnings as the programs are implemented.

Special Items

Restructuring and Other Charges

International Paper continually evaluates its operations for opportunities for improvement. These evaluations are targeted to (a) focus our portfolio on our core businesses of paper, packaging and forest products, (b) rationalize and realign capacity to operate fewer facilities with the same revenue capability and close high cost facilities, and (c) reduce costs. Annually, strategic operating plans are developed by each of our businesses to demonstrate that they will achieve a return at least equal to their cost of capital over an economic cycle. If it subsequently becomes apparent that a facility’s plan will not be achieved, a decision is then made

to (a) invest additional capital to upgrade the facility, (b) shut down the facility and record the corresponding charge, or (c) evaluate the expected recovery of the carrying value of the facility to determine if an impairment of the asset value of the facility has occurred under SFAS No. 144.

In recent years, this policy has led to the shutdown of a number of facilities and the recording of significant asset impairment charges and severance costs. As this profit improvement initiative is ongoing, it is possible that additional charges and costs will be incurred in future periods should such triggering events occur.

2004:

During 2004, restructuring and other charges before taxes and minority interest of $211 million ($124 million after taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included a $74 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($43 million after taxes and minority interest) for organizational restructuring programs, a $92 million charge before taxes ($57 million after taxes) for early debt retirement costs, a $35 million charge before minority interest ($18 million after minority interest) for a goodwill impairment charge, and a $10 million charge before taxes ($6 million after taxes) for a litigation settlement. Also in 2004, a $123 million credit before taxes ($76 million after taxes) was recorded for insurance recoveries related to the hardboard siding and roofing litigation, and a $35 million credit before taxes
and minority interest ($22 million after taxes and minority interest) was recorded for the net reversal of restructuring reserves no longer required.

2003:

During 2003, restructuring and other charges before taxes and minority interest of $298 million ($184 million after taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included a $236 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($144 million after taxes and minority interest) for asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions, a $63 million charge before taxes ($39 million after taxes) for legal reserves, and a $1 million credit before taxes ($1 million charge after taxes) for early debt retirement costs. In addition, a $40 million credit before taxes and minority interest ($25 million after taxes and minority interest) was recorded for the net reversal of restructuring reserves no longer required.

2002:

During 2002, restructuring and other charges before taxes and minority interest of $695 million ($435 million after taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included a $199 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($130 million after taxes and minority interest) for asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions, a $450 million pre-tax charge ($278 million after taxes) for additional exterior siding legal reserves, and a charge of $46 million before taxes and minority interest ($27 million after taxes and minority interest) for early debt


retirement
        costs. In addition, a $68 million pre-tax credit ($43 million after taxes)
        was recorded in 2002 for the reversal of 2001 and 2000 reserves no longer
        required.

A
        further discussion of restructuring, business improvement and other charges
        can be found in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
        in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Net
        Losses (Gains) on Sales and Impairments of Businesses Held for Sale

Net
        losses (gains) on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale totaled
        $135 million in 2004, $32 million in 2003 and ($41) million in 2002 before
        taxes and minority interest. The principal components of these gains/losses
        were:

2004:

In December 2004, International Paper committed
        to plans for the sale in 2005 of its Fine Papers business and its Maresquel
        mill and Papeteries de France distribution business in Europe, resulting
        in charges of $56 million before taxes ($54 million after taxes) to write
        down the assets of these entities to their estimated fair values less
        costs to sell. In October 2004, International Paper sold two box plants
        located in China, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $14 million ($4 million
        after taxes). Also in the fourth quarter, a $9 million loss before taxes
        ($6 million after taxes) was recorded to adjust gains/losses of businesses
        previously sold.

In
        the 2004 third quarter, a charge of $38 million before and after taxes
        was recorded for losses associated with the sale of Scaldia Papier B.V.
        and its subsidiary Recom B.V. ($34 million) and to adjust the estimated
        loss on sale of Papeteries de Souche L.C. ($4 million).

In
        the 2004 second quarter, a charge of $27 million before and after taxes
        was recorded to write down the assets of Papeteries de Souche L.C. to
        their estimated realizable value.

In
        the 2004 first quarter, a pre-tax gain of $9 million ($6 million after
        taxes) was recorded to adjust previously estimated gains/losses of businesses
        previously sold.

In
        addition, the 2004 second quarter included a loss of $9 million before
        taxes and minority interest ($5 million after taxes and minority interest)
        to write down the assets of Food Pack S.A. to their estimated realizable
        value, of which $4 million was included in the Packaging segment, $3 million
        was included in the Carter Holt Harvey segment and $2 million was included
        in Minority interest.

2003:

In the fourth quarter of 2003, International
        Paper recorded a $34 million pre-tax charge ($34 million after taxes)
        to write down the assets of its Polyrey business to estimated fair value.
        In addition, a $13 million pre-tax gain

($8
        million after taxes) was recorded to adjust estimated gains/losses of
        businesses previously sold.

A
        pre-tax charge of $1 million ($1 million after taxes) was recorded in
        the 2003 third quarter to adjust previously estimated gains/losses of
        businesses previously sold.

In
        the second quarter of 2003, a $10 million pre-tax charge ($6 million after
        taxes) was recorded to adjust estimated gains/losses of businesses previously
        sold.

2002:

In the fourth and third quarters of 2002,
        International Paper recorded $10 million and $3 million of pre-tax credits
        ($4 million and $1 million after taxes, respectively), to adjust estimated
        accrued costs of businesses previously sold.

During
        the second quarter of 2002, a net gain on sales of businesses held for
        sale of $28 million before taxes and minority interest ($96 million after
        taxes and minority interest) was recorded, including a pre-tax gain of
        $63 million ($40 million after taxes) from the sale in April 2002 of International
        Paper’s oriented strand board facilities to Nexfor Inc. for $250
        million, and a net charge of $35 million before taxes and minority interest
        (a gain of $56 million after taxes and minority interest) relating to
        other sales and adjustments of previously recorded estimated costs of
        businesses held for sale.

The
        impairment charge recorded for Arizona Chemical in the fourth quarter
        of 2001 included a tax expense based on the form of sale being negotiated
        at that time. As a result of the decision in the second quarter of 2002
        to discontinue sale efforts and to hold and operate Arizona Chemical in
        the future, this provision was no longer required. Consequently, special
        items for the second quarter of 2002 include a gain of $28 million before
        taxes and minority interest, with an associated $96 million benefit after
        taxes and minority interest.

Industry
        Segment Operating Profit

Industry
        segment operating profits of $2.1 billion were higher than the $1.8 billion
        in 2003 and the $1.9 billion in 2002. The higher profit in 2004 was principally
        due to improved sales volumes ($263 million), higher average sales prices
        ($201 million), and cost reduction initiatives and a more favorable product
        mix ($186 million), all partially offset by higher energy and raw material
        costs ($192 million), lower earnings from land sales ($95 million), the
        impact of hurricanes in the South ($18 million) and unfavorable foreign
        currency exchange rates ($30 million). In 2003, industry segment operating
        profits declined slightly as compared with 2002 principally due to higher
        energy and raw material costs ($275 million) and lower average prices
        ($85 million), partially offset by the effect of cost reduction initiatives,
        improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix ($245
        million).


The rationalization and realignment program announced in 2003 was completed during 2004. The program announced in July 2003 targeted significant additional reductions in overhead costs and included the elimination of approximately 3,000 salaried positions in the United States. We are currently engaged in a customer-driven, company-wide supply chain initiative that will enhance International Paper’s customer relationships and standardize processes while improving overall company profitability. Ultimately, the initiative will provide the foundation upon which to build improved customer value propositions while enabling International Paper to become increasingly competitive.

International Paper experienced an improving business environment during 2004 as higher sales volume and average prices reflected a steadily improving economy. Demand for our paper and packaging products was stronger resulting in only about 70,000 tons of market related downtime in our mill system compared with 590,000 tons in 2003. Our focus on operational performance and improvements to our internal cost structure and product mix helped mitigate the impact of increased raw material and energy costs. Looking forward to 2005, we anticipate a seasonally slow start in the first quarter as wood and chemical costs continue to be high with further increases expected early in the year. Earnings in 2005 should benefit from increased price realizations and improved demand for our products. We believe that the actions taken over the last few years to restructure our operations
and eliminate excess manufacturing capacity, to reduce overhead costs, and to focus on our customer relationships will favorably position International Paper as market conditions continue to improve.

D

escription of Industry Segments

International Paper’s industry segments discussed below are consistent with the internal structure used to manage these businesses. All segments, except for Carter Holt Harvey, are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry. The Carter Holt Harvey business includes the results of multiple Forest Products businesses.

Printing Papers

International Paper is one of the world’s leading producers of printing and writing papers. Products in this segment include uncoated and coated papers, market pulp and bristols.

Forest Products

Forest
        Resources:

International Paper owns or manages
        approximately 6.8 million acres of forestlands in the United States, mostly
        in the South. All lands are independently third- party certified under
        the operating standards of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI®).
        In 2004, these

forestlands supplied about 23% of the wood fiber requirements of our other businesses. Our forestlands are managed as a portfolio to optimize the economic value to our shareholders. Principal revenue-generating activities include the sale of trees for harvest, the sale of forestlands to investment funds and other buyers for various uses, real estate development, and the leasing of our properties for third-party recreational and commercial uses. The mix of these activities varies based on the fiber requirements of our mills and wood products plants, prevailing stumpage prices, supply and demand for forestlands, and market preferences for timber and forestlands. When stumpage prices are depressed relative to land values, forestland sales tend to comprise a larger part of our portfolio mix. Conversely, when stumpage prices are high, stumpage sales may be the best
alternative to maximize the value of our forestland holdings.

Wood Products:

International Paper owns and operates 25 plants producing lumber, plywood, engineered wood products and utility poles in the southern United States. Through these, we produce approximately 2.5 billion board feet of lumber and 1.6 billion square feet of plywood annually. On December 31, 2004, International Paper sold its wholly-owned subsidiary Weldwood of Canada Limited (Weldwood) to West Fraser Timber Company Limited. During our ownership, Weldwood operated 10 plants in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, which produced about 1.3 billion board feet of lumber and 495 million square feet of plywood annually. Prior to the sale, we had harvesting rights on 10.2 million acres of government-owned forestlands in Canada through licenses and forest management agreements.

Carter Holt Harvey

Carter Holt Harvey

is approximately 50.5% owned by International Paper. It is one of the largest forest products companies in the Southern Hemisphere, with operations in New Zealand, Australia and Asia. Sales consist of approximately 46% in New Zealand, 36% in Australia and 18% in Asia and elsewhere. Carter Holt Harvey’s major businesses include:

Forests

, including ownership of 785,000 acres of predominantly radiata pine plantations that currently yield 5.5 million tons of logs annually. Long term sustainable yield of the estate is about 8.5 million tons of logs annually.

Wood Products

, including about 467 million board feet of lumber capacity, 90 million square feet of laminated veneer lumber production and about 1,072 million square feet of plywood and panel production, including approximately 205 million square feet from Plantation Timber Products in China acquired in 2004. Carter Holt Harvey is the largest Australasian producer of lumber, plywood, panels and laminated veneer lumber.


Pulp,
        Paper and Packaging

, with overall capacity
        of more than 1.1 million tons of annual linerboard and pulp capacity at
        four mills, Carter Holt Harvey is New Zealand’s largest manufacturer
        and marketer of pulp and paper products. These supply 65% of the needs
        of their packaging plants which produce corrugated boxes, cartons and
        paper bags, with a focus on horticulture and primary produce.

Specialty
        Businesses and Other

Chemicals:

Arizona Chemical is a leading producer of oleo
        chemicals and specialty resins based on crude tall oil, byproducts of
        the wood pulping process. These products, used in adhesives and inks,
        are made at 13 plants in the United States and Europe.

European
        Distribution:

International Paper sold Scaldia
        on August 31, 2004. Prior to the sale, European Distribution consisted
        of Papeteries de France and Scaldia and served markets in France, Belgium
        and the Netherlands.

        Segment Results

Printing
        Papers

Demand
        for Printing Papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial
        printing and advertising activity, direct mail volumes and, for uncoated
        free sheet products, with changes in white-collar employment levels that
        affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper. These products are further
        affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage
        producers in different geographic regions. Principal cost drivers include
        manufacturing efficiency and raw material, transportation and energy costs.

Printing
        Papers

net sales for 2004 increased 5% from
        2003 and 2002. Operating profits in 2004 were 26% higher than in 2003
        and 6% higher than in 2002. Earnings in 2004 compared with 2003 improved
        across all Printing Papers businesses. Higher sales volumes ($130 million),
        improved mill operations and lower overhead costs ($90 million) and a
        more profitable product mix ($20 million) contributed to the earnings
        increase, although these effects were partially offset by higher raw material
        and energy costs ($90 million) and lower average prices in Europe which
        more than offset higher average prices in the United States ($30 million).
        Compared with 2002, higher 2004 earnings in the Brazilian Papers and Market
        Pulp businesses were partially offset by lower earnings in both the Uncoated
        and Coated Papers businesses. The Printing Papers segment took 525,000
        tons of downtime in 2004, including 65,000 tons of lack-of-order

downtime
        to align production with customer demand. This compared with 750,000 tons
        of downtime in 2003, of which 335,000 tons related to lack of orders.

sales were $4.9 billion in 2004, up
        4% from 2003 and 2% from 2002. Operating profits rose 11% compared with
        2003, but were 18% lower than 2002.

In
        the United States, our average price realizations improved steadily during
        2004 compared with 2003 and ended the year higher than in either 2003
        or 2002. On average, prices were up 1% in 2004 compared with 2003 and
        2002. The improving economic environment in 2004 resulted in stronger
        demand, particularly in the commercial printing and converting markets,
        as sales volumes rose 4% and 2% compared with 2003 and 2002, respectively.
        In addition to higher average sales prices and improved shipments, improved
        mill operations also had a positive impact on 2004 earnings. These positive
        factors were partially offset by higher input costs, particularly for
        wood and energy costs. The business was also adversely impacted by higher
        transportation costs in 2004 compared with 2003 and the impact of hurricanes
        in the South. The earnings decline in 2004 compared with 2002 was due
        principally to higher wood and energy costs offset somewhat by an increase
        in shipments and lower overhead costs as a result of our cost reduction
        initiatives.

Average prices in our European operations declined throughout most of
        2004 as a strong Euro made Western Europe a more attractive market for
        imports, putting pressure on prices. Average prices were down 8% and 17%
        as compared with 2003 and 2002, respectively. European sales volumes rose
        5% in 2004 compared with 2003 and 6% versus 2002. Earnings in Eastern
        Europe in 2004 were higher than in 2003, but were more than offset by
        the earnings decline in the West. Overall, lower average prices and higher
        wood and energy costs offset the favorable effects of higher sales volumes,
        a better mix of products sold and improved mill operations.

Coated
        Papers

sales were $1.5 billion in 2004, compared
        with $1.4 billion in 2003 and $1.5 billion in 2002. Although the business
        reported an operating loss for the year, a profit was recorded for the
        second half of 2004. The improvement in earnings in 2004 compared with
        2003 was driven by lower overhead costs, improved mill operations and
        higher sales prices for our products. These positive factors, combined
        with improved product sales mix, more than offset the impact







In January 2004, approximately $1.0 billion of debt with an 8.05% blended coupon rate was retired, including all of the outstanding $805 million principal amount of International Paper Capital Trust III 7.875% preferred securities, using the proceeds from the two December 2003 issuances of $500 million each of notes discussed below.

During 2004, Carter Holt Harvey borrowed $425 million under its multi-currency and commercial paper credit facilities at interest rates ranging from 5.5% to 6.8% to be repaid during 2005. Proceeds from the borrowing were used to repay approximately $305 million of 8.875% notes and cross-currency and interest rate swap settlements with a maturity date of December 2004.

In addition to the preceding repayments, various other International Paper borrowings totaling approximately $1.0 billion were repaid in 2004.

Other financing activity in 2004 included the issuance of approximately 3,652,000 treasury shares and 2,333,000 common shares under various incentive plans, including stock option exercises that generated $164 million of cash.

2003:

Financing activities during 2003 included debt and preferred security issuances of $2.4 billion and retirements totaling $1.4 billion for a net increase of $1.0 billion, before non-cash adjustments under FIN 46 (see Recent Accounting Developments). The increase reflects the timing of $1 billion of borrowings in December 2003 used to retire approximately $1 billion of debt in early 2004 as discussed above. Other 2003 financing activity included the redemption of $550 million and the issuance of $150 million of preferred securities of International Paper subsidiaries.

In December 2003, $500 million of 4.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due January 15, 2009, and $500 million of 5.50% Senior Unsecured Notes due January 15, 2014, were issued. In January 2004, the proceeds from these issuances were used to redeem $805 million of 7.875% preferred securities of International Paper Capital Trust III that, prior to July 1, 2003, was a subsidiary of International Paper (see Notes 4 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). The remaining proceeds were used for the repayment or early retirement of other debt.

In March 2003, $300 million of 3.80% notes due in April 2008, and $700 million of 5.30% notes due in April 2015, were issued. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay approximately $450 million of commercial paper and long-term debt and to redeem $550 million of preferred securities of IP Finance (Barbados) Limited, a non-U.S. consolidated subsidiary of International Paper. In the same period, International Paper sold a minority interest in

Southeast Timber, Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of International Paper, to a private investor for $150 million with future dividend payments based on LIBOR. Other financing activity included $26 million for the repurchase of approximately 713,000 shares of International Paper common stock, and the issuance of 2,725,000 treasury shares under various incentive plans, including stock option exercises that generated $80 million of cash.

2002:

Financing activities during 2002 included debt issuances of $2.0 billion and retirements of $3.0 billion, for a net debt reduction of $1.0 billion. Debt issuances in 2002 included $1.2 billion of 5.85% Senior Unsecured Notes due in October 2012, the proceeds of which were used to retire most of International Paper’s $1.2 billion of 8.0% notes due July 2003 that were issued in connection with the Champion acquisition. Other financing activity included $169 million for the repurchase of approximately 4,390,000 shares of International Paper common stock, and the issuance of 1,403,000 shares for various incentive plans, including stock option exercises that generated $53 million of cash.

Refinancing of high coupon rate debt in the last three years is one means the Company uses to manage interest expense. Another method is the use of interest rate swaps to change the mix between fixed and variable rate debt. At December 31, 2004, International Paper had entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $2.2 billion. These swaps reduced 2004 interest expense by $52 million before taxes and minority interest, or 236 basis points, on $2.2 billion of related debt. At December 31, 2004, the swaps reduced the weighted average fixed rate on the debt of 5% to an effective rate of 2.6% with maturities ranging from one to 11 years.

Dividend payments totaled $485 million in 2004, $480 million in 2003 and $482 million in 2002. The International Paper common stock dividend remained at $1.00 per share during the three-year period.

In August 2004, CHH used a portion of the funds generated in connection with the second quarter sale of its Tissue business to repurchase shares from its shareholders, including approximately $158 million that was paid to minority shareholders.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, cash and temporary investments totaled $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. Both balances were higher than normal as they included cash proceeds from the sales of Weldwood of Canada Limited and the Maine and New Hampshire forestlands (2004) and $1 billion of borrowings (2003) that were used in part for the retirement of debt in January of the following year.


Capital
        Resources Outlook for 2005

International
        Paper can meet projected capital expenditures, service existing debt and
        meet working capital and dividend requirements during 2005 through cash
        from operations, supplemented as required by its various existing credit
        facilities. International Paper has approximately $3.2 billion of committed
        liquidity, which we believe is adequate to cover expected operating cash
        flow variability during our industry’s economic cycles. This includes
        $2 billion available under contractually committed bank credit agreements
        and up to $1.2 billion of available commercial paper-based financings
        under a receivables securitization program. At December 31, 2004, there
        were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements. Additionally, multi-currency
        credit facilities equivalent to NZ$725 million are available for liquidity
        requirements of our Carter Holt Harvey subsidiary in New Zealand. At December
        31, 2004, CHH had approximately NZ$381 million of borrowings under these
        facilities.

Liquidity
        could also be enhanced by possible future earnings repatriation decisions
        associated with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. See Note 9 of
        the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements
        and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

The
        Company will continue to rely upon debt capital markets for the majority
        of any necessary funding not provided by operating cash flow or repatriated
        cash. Funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning
        and liability management practices. The primary goals of the Company’s
        capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve
        liquidity while reducing interest expense. In 2005, the Company will continue
        to access the capital markets where there are opportunities to replace
        high coupon debt with new financing instruments at lower interest rates,
        with a target of reducing consolidated debt to approximately $12 billion
        by the end of 2006. Accordingly, an additional $750 million of debt was
        subsequently repaid as of February 2005.

The
        majority of International Paper’s debt is accessed through global
        public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors. The Company
        was well within the requirements for compliance with all its debt covenants
        at December 31, 2004. Principal financial covenants include maintenance
        of a minimum net worth of $9 billion, defined as the sum of common stock,
        paid-in capital and retained earnings, less treasury stock, plus any goodwill
        impairment charges, and a maximum total debt to capital ratio, defined
        as total debt divided by total debt plus net worth plus the minority interest
        in CHH, of 60%.

Maintaining
        an investment grade credit rating is an important element of International
        Paper’s financing strategy. At

December
        31, 2004, the Company held long-term credit ratings of BBB (negative outlook)
        and Baa2 (negative outlook) by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s
        Investor Services, respectively. The Company currently has short-term
        credit ratings by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investor
        Services of A-3 and P-2, respectively .

Contractual
        obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments

        business related to raw material purchases and energy contracts. Other
        significant items include purchase obligations related to contracted services.

Critical

Accounting Policies

The
        preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
        accounting principles in the United States requires International Paper
        to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both
        the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues
        and expenses. Some of these estimates require judgments about matters
        that are inherently uncertain.

Accounting
        policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported
        results of operations and financial position of International Paper, and
        that can require judgments by management that affect their application,
        include SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” SFAS No.
        144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”
        SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” SFAS No.
        87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,” SFAS No. 106,
        “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
        Pensions,” as amended by SFAS No. 132 and 132R, “Employers’
        Disclosures About Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” and
        SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” The following is
        a discussion of the impact of these accounting policies on International
        Paper:




The
        increase in 2004 U.S. pension expense, and the change in 2003 to net pension
        expense from income in 2002, were principally due to a reduction in the
        expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in 2003, and increases
        in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses, with smaller impacts
        from reductions in the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of future
        compensation increases.

For
        2005, the Company estimates that it will record net pension expense of
        approximately $210 million for its U.S. defined benefit plans, with the
        increase versus 2004 principally reflecting increased amortization of
        unrecognized actuarial losses over a shorter average remaining service
        period, a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 5.75% in 2005 from
        6.00% in 2004, and a decrease in the expected return on plan assets to
        8.50% in 2005 from 8.75% in 2004. The estimated 2005 pension expense for
        our non-U.S. plans is $32 million, with the decrease from 2004 reflecting
        the sale of Weldwood. Net postretirement benefit costs in 2005 will decrease
        by approximately $13 million reflecting the impact of the Medicare Prescription
        Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, partially offset by a
        decline in the discount rate assumption from 6.00% in 2004 to 5.75% in
        2005.

The
        market value of plan assets for International Paper’s U.S. pension
        plan at December 31, 2004, totaled approximately $6.7 billion, consisting
        of approximately 62% equity securities, 27% fixed income securities, and
        11% real estate and other assets. Plan assets did not include International
        Paper common stock.

International
        Paper makes contributions that are sufficient to fully fund its actuarially
        determined costs, generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the
        Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). While International Paper
        may elect to make voluntary contributions to its U.S. qualified plan up
        to the maximum deductible amount per IRS tax regulations in the coming
        years, it is unlikely that any contributions to the plan will be required
        before 2007 unless investment performance is negative or International
        Paper changes its funding policy to make contributions above the minimum
        requirements. The U.S. nonqualified plans are only funded to the extent
        of benefits paid which are expected to be $21 million in 2005.

Accounting
        for Stock Options.

International Paper accounts
        for stock options using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles
        Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”
        Under this method, compensation expense is recorded over the related service
        period when the market price exceeds the option price at the measurement
        date, which is the grant date for International Paper’s options.
        No compensation expense is recorded as options are issued with an exercise
        price equal to the market price of International Paper stock on the grant
        date.

During each reporting period, fully diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “in-the-money” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace. When options are actually exercised, option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share, with no effect on reported earnings. Equity is also increased by the tax benefit that International Paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns.

Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” expense for stock options is measured at the grant date based on a computed fair value of options granted, and then charged to expense over the related service period. Had this method of accounting been applied, additional expense of $38 million in 2004, $44 million in 2003, and $41 million in 2002 would have been recorded, decreasing reported earnings (loss) per share by 114% to ($.15) in 2004, 14% to $.54 in 2003, and 5% to ($1.92) in 2002.

Beginning in 2005, U.S. employees will no longer receive stock option awards. Accordingly, the provisions of recently issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), that require compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements, will mainly affect only previously issued options that are still outstanding and unvested on the effective date, as well as reload grants. While the exact impact on expense will depend upon the number of remaining unvested options at that time, the adoption of this standard could increase pre-tax compensation expense by approximately $20 million in both 2005 and 2006, with no significant impact in subsequent years.

At December 31, 2004, 45.4 million options were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from $29.31 to $66.81 per share. At December 31, 2003, 42.8 million options were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from $29.31 to $69.63 per share.

I

ncome Taxes

Before minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes, the effective income tax rates were 28%, (39%) and (24%) for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special and unusual items that can affect the effective income tax rate in a given year, but may not recur in subsequent years. Management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special or unusual items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special or unusual items were to occur in those years. Excluding these special and unusual items, the effective income tax rate for 2004 was 26% of pre-tax earnings


compared with 20% in 2003 and 29% in 2002. The increase in the rate in 2004 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. We estimate that the 2005 effective income tax rate will be approximately 33% based on expected earnings and business conditions, which are subject to change.

        Accounting Developments

The following represent recently issued accounting pronouncements that will affect reporting and disclosures in future periods. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a further discussion of each item.

Share-Based Payment Transactions:

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” which will require compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements. The amount of the compensation cost will be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. In addition, liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period. Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. This statement applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased or cancelled after that date. This Statement will be effective for International Paper in the third quarter of 2005.

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets:

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,” which replaces the exception from fair value measurement in APB Opinion No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions,” for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets with a general exception from fair value measurement for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. This statement is to be applied prospectively and is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. International Paper believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Accounting for Income Taxes:

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by

the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act)” that provides tax relief to U.S. domestic manufacturers. The FSP states that the manufacturers’ deduction provided for under the Act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with Statement 109 rather than a tax rate reduction.

Also in December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,” addressing accounting and disclosure guidance relating to a company’s repatriation program. The additional disclosures required under this staff position are included in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

These FSP’s were effective upon issuance.

Inventory Costs:

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,” which requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the “so abnormal” criterion outlined in ARB No. 43. This statement also introduces the concept of “normal capacity” and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. This statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. International Paper believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will not have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.

Accounting for Medicare Benefits:

In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106-2 that provides guidance on the accounting and required disclosures for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. International Paper adopted FSP FAS 106-2 prospectively in the third quarter of 2004. The impact was a reduction of net postretirement benefit cost of approximately $8 million for the last half of 2004 and a reduction of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $110 million.

Information about Capital Structure – Contingently Convertible Securities:

In April 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 129-1, Disclosure Requirements under FASB Statement No. 129, “Disclosure of Information about Capital Structure,” relating to contingently convertible securities and to their potentially dilutive effects on earnings per share. The FSP required expanded


disclosures of the significant terms of the conversion features of these securities to enable users of the financial statements to understand the circumstances of the contingencies and the potential impact of conversion. These additional disclosures are presented for International Paper’s contingently convertible securities in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

In October 2004, the FASB ratified a consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force of the FASB that, effective for periods ending after December 15, 2004, contingently convertible securities should be included in the computation of diluted earnings per share regardless of whether or not the market price trigger for issuance of the securities has been met. Furthermore, the calculation of diluted earnings per share for all prior periods presented should be restated to reflect this consensus. At December 31, 2004, International Paper had outstanding $2.1 billion principal amount of zero-coupon convertible senior debentures that are convertible into approximately 20 million shares of common stock subject to certain conditions. Accordingly, the calculation of diluted earnings per common share shown in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, reflects the assumed conversion of these debentures for all periods presented.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities:

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51.” This Interpretation changed existing consolidation rules for certain entities, those in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support.

The interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities (VIE’s) created after January 31, 2003, and to VIE’s in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. International Paper neither entered into nor obtained an interest in any VIE’s after January 31, 2003. For VIE’s created before February 1, 2003, this interpretation was effective for the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. During December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 (FIN 46(R)) with varying effective dates. International Paper, applied FIN 46(R) to its variable interest entities as of December 31, 2003.

The cumulative effect of adoption of FIN 46(R) amounted to a $3 million charge after taxes.

Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity:

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” It established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This standard was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. International Paper adopted this standard during the third quarter ended September 30, 2003, with no material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities:

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The statement changed the measurement and timing of recognition for exit costs, including restructuring charges, and was effective for activities initiated after December 31, 2002. It requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity, such as one-time termination benefits, be recognized when the liability is incurred, rather than at the date of a company’s commitment to an exit plan. It had no effect on charges recorded for exit activities begun prior to December 31, 2002. International Paper adopted this standard effective January 1, 2003, with no material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets:

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” It established a single accounting model for the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of by sale or abandonment, and broadened the definition of discontinued operations. International Paper adopted SFAS No. 144 in 2002, with no significant change in the accounting for the impairment and disposal of long-lived assets.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” It requires the recording of an asset and a liability equal to the present value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of long-lived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists. The asset is required to be depreciated over the life of the related equipment or facility, and the liability accreted each year using a credit- adjusted risk-free rate.

International Paper adopted SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003, recording a discounted liability of $22 million, an


increase in Property, plant and equipment, net, of $7 million, and a one-time cumulative effect of accounting change charge of $10 million (net of a deferred tax benefit of $5 million).

Environmental Matters

International Paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations in all other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our continuing objectives are to: (1) control emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air, water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment, (2) make continual improvements in environmental performance, and (3) maintain 100% compliance with applicable laws and regulations. A total of $99 million was spent in 2004 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water, and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste. We expect to spend approximately $140 million in 2005 for similar capital projects, including the costs to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Cluster Rule regulations. Amounts to be spent for
environmental control projects in future years will depend on new laws and regulations and changes in legal requirements and environmental concerns. Taking these uncertainties into account, our preliminary estimate for additional environmental appropriations during the year 2006 is approximately $121 million, and during the year 2007 is approximately $42 million. The reduced capital forecast for 2007 reflects the reduction in Cluster Rule spending and completion of significant environmental improvement projects in Brazil.

On April 15, 1998, the EPA issued final Cluster Rule regulations that established new requirements regarding air emissions and wastewater discharges from pulp and paper mills to be met by 2006. The projected costs included in our spending estimate related to the Cluster Rule regulations for the year 2005 are $61 million. Included in this estimate are costs associated with pulp and paper industry combustion source standards that were issued by the EPA on January 12, 2001. Total projected Cluster Rule costs for 2006 through 2007 are $58 million.

The EPA is continuing the development of new programs and standards such as additional wastewater discharge allocations, water intake structure requirements and national ambient air quality standards. When regulatory requirements for new and changing standards are finalized, we will add any resulting future cost requirements to our expenditure forecast.

International Paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in a total of 88 environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws, including the

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Most of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources. While joint and several liability is authorized under CERCLA and equivalent state laws, as a practical matter, liability for CERCLA cleanups is allocated among the many potential responsible parties. Based upon previous experience with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances and upon presently available information, International Paper believes that it has de minimis or no liability with respect to 20 of these sites; that liability is not likely to be significant at 29 sites; and estimates that liability at the remaining 39 sites is likely to be significant, but not material to International Paper’s consolidated financial
statements. Related costs are recorded in the financial statements when they are probable and reasonably estimable. International Paper believes that the probable liability associated with these 88 proceedings is approximately $48 million.

In addition to the above 88 proceedings, other remediation costs recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet totaled approximately $37 million. Completion of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. As of February 2005, there were no other pending judicial proceedings, brought by government authorities against International Paper, for alleged violations of applicable environmental laws or regulations.

Finally, on October 10, 2003, the Company was served with a civil administrative complaint by the EPA seeking a civil penalty of $673,969 based on alleged hazardous waste deficiencies at the Company’s treated pole facility in Joplin, Missouri. In August 2004, the Company and the EPA settled the matter and the Company agreed to pay a penalty in the amount of $86,649 and to perform additional environmental assessments of the facility.

International Paper is involved in other contractual disputes, administrative and legal proceedings and investigations of various types. While any litigation, proceeding or investigation has an element of uncertainty, we believe that the outcome of any proceeding, lawsuit or claim that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Litigation

See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a detailed discussion of each of the following litigation matters.

Exterior Siding and Roofing Litigation:

Three nationwide class action lawsuits filed against International Paper have been settled in recent years. A provision of $450


million was recorded in 2002 to increase existing reserve balances to projected settlement amounts. At December 31, 2004, reserves for these actions totaled $259 million.

Insurance Matters:

In connection with one of the exterior siding and roofing actions above, International Paper commenced a lawsuit against certain insurance carriers relating to their refusal to indemnify International Paper and, in the case of one insurance carrier, also for its refusal to provide a defense. In July 2003, a jury determined that $383 million of International Paper’s payments to settle these claims are covered by its insurance policies. International Paper is engaged in further court proceedings to determine each carrier’s allocable share. International Paper is also participating in court-ordered mediation with some of those insurance carriers and has settled its claims with certain other insurance carriers.

In addition, International Paper was involved in a dispute with a third party regarding $100 million paid to International Paper under an alternative risk-transfer agreement. In February 2004, an agreement was reached whereby International Paper agreed to pay the third party a portion of future insurance proceeds as they are recovered by International Paper beginning in 2004, up to a maximum of $95 million.

Antitrust Matters:

In 2003, International Paper, along with two other defendants, settled a class action lawsuit alleging that it and other manufacturers of linerboard conspired to fix prices for corrugated sheets and containers during the period October 1, 1993, through November 30, 1995. International Paper’s share of this settlement, with a substantial proportion of the class (which included claims brought against Union Camp acquired by the Company in 1999), was $24.4 million.

In connection with this class action lawsuit, a number of plaintiffs opted out of the class action and filed lawsuits in various federal district courts. These lawsuits, which have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in federal court in Pennsylvania, allege a class period of October 1, 1993 through February 28, 1997.

In
        addition to the foregoing the Company is a defendant in several other
        antitrust class actions. One of the matters, relating to the Company’s
        fiber procurement, has been certified as a class action in the federal
        court in the District of South Carolina. Another purported class action
        involves publication papers, and has been recently consolidated for pre-trial
        purposes in the federal court for the District of Connecticut. Discovery
        in that case has not yet begun.

The Company is vigorously defending these cases and believes it has valid defenses.

E

ffect of Inflation

While inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as energy, wood fiber and chemical costs, have an impact on the Company’s operating results, changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in the last three years. Sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors.

F

oreign Currency Effects

International Paper has operations in a number of countries. Its operations in those countries also export to, and compete with imports from, other regions. As such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s financial statements. Direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars. Indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the United States (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). In general, a lower U.S. dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to International Paper. The currencies that have the most impact are the Euro, the Canadian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the Brazilian real, the Polish zloty and the Russian ruble.

M

arket Risk

We use financial instruments, including fixed and variable rate debt, to finance operations, for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, financial instruments, including various derivative contracts, are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and foreign currency risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. Information related to International Paper’s debt obligations is included in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments. We assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and currency rates and commodity prices.


Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short- and long-term debt obligations and investments in marketable securities. We invest in investment grade securities of financial institutions and industrial companies and limit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in marketable securities at December 31, 2004 are stated at cost, which approximates market due to their short-term nature. Our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was immaterial.

We issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with International Paper’s optimal capital structure, while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate. Derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, may be used to implement the optimal capital structure. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $11.3 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates would be approximately $419 million and $430 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Commodity Price Risk

The objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. Commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices. There are no outstanding energy hedge contracts as of December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2003, the net fair value of such contracts was a $5 million asset. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been immaterial for 2003.

Foreign Currency Risk

International
        Paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency
        exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated
        in foreign countries. Our objective in managing the associated foreign
        currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations
        on our after-tax cash flows. We address these risks on a limited basis
        through financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations
        with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s
        functional currency, or by entering into long-term cross-currency and
        interest rate swaps, or short-term foreign exchange contracts. At December
        31, 2004 and 2003, the net fair value liability of financial instruments
        with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately $510 million
        and $540 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for

such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be immaterial for both 2004 and 2003.

eport of Management on:

Financial Statements -

The management of International Paper Company is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America considered appropriate in the circumstances to present fairly the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows on a consistent basis. Management has also prepared the other information in this annual report and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

As can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment, some financial statement amounts are based on estimates and judgments. However, measures have been taken to provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial information contained in this annual report. We have formed a Disclosure Committee to oversee this process.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP. During their audits, they were given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of stockholders and the board of directors and all committees of the board. Management believes that all representations made to the independent auditors during their audits were valid and appropriate.

Internal Controls over Financial Reporting -

The management of International Paper Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting including the safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition. These controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding preparation of reliable published financial statements and such asset safeguarding. The system is supported by written policies and procedures, contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and is audited by internal audit. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

The
        Company has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
        reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, it used
        the criteria described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework”
        issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
        (COSO). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December
        31, 2004, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
        is effective. Deloitte & Touche LLP, have issued their report on management’s
        assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
        over financial reporting. The report appears on page 37.

Internal Control Environment and Board of

Directors Oversight -

Our internal control environment includes an enterprise-wide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top.” This is exemplified by our ethics program that includes long-standing principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of International Paper business, that have been distributed to all employees, a toll-free telephone helpline whereby any employee may report suspected violations of law or International Paper’s policy, and an office of ethics and business practice. The internal controls system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and
management personnel, appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility, dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout International Paper, and an extensive program of internal audits with management follow-up.

The Board of Directors, assisted by the Audit and Finance Committee (Committee), monitors the integrity of the Company’s financial statements and financial reporting procedures, the performance of the Company’s internal audit function and independent auditors, and other matters set forth in its charter. The Committee, which currently consists of four independent directors, meets regularly with representatives of management, and with the independent auditors and the Internal Auditor, with and without management representatives in attendance, to review their activities. The Committee’s Charter takes into account the New York Stock Exchange rules relating to Audit Committees and the SEC rules and regulations promulgated as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. A copy of the charter will be included in the Company’s definitive proxy statement
relating to the annual meeting of shareholders in 2005. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, including critical accounting policies and significant management judgments, with management and the independent auditors. The Committee’s report recommending the inclusion of such financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will be set forth in our proxy statement.

on Consolidated Financial Statements

To
        the Shareholders of International Paper Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of International Paper Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of International Paper Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 7, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN COMMON SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

(1)

The cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment (in millions) was $(29), $(284) and $(1,092) at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Our Business

International Paper is a global forest products, paper and packaging company that is complemented by an extensive North American merchant distribution system, with primary markets and manufacturing operations in the United States, Europe, the Pacific Rim and South America. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to available industry capacity and general economic conditions.

Financial Statements

These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require the use of management’s estimates. Actual future results could differ from management’s estimates.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International Paper and its wholly-owned, controlled majority-owned and financially controlled subsidiaries. Minority interest principally represents minority shareholders’ proportionate share of the equity in our consolidated subsidiary, Carter Holt Harvey Limited (CHH). All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.

Investments in affiliated companies are accounted for by the equity method, including companies owned 20% to 50%. International Paper’s share of affiliates’ earnings totalled $18 million, $10 million and ($10) million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated f.o.b. (free on board) shipping point. For sales transactions designated f.o.b. destination, revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer’s delivery site, when title and risk of loss are transferred. Timber and timberland sales revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the buyer.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping
        and handling costs, such as freight to our customers’ destinations,
        are included in distribution expenses

in
        the consolidated statement of operations. These costs, when included in
        the sales price charged for our products, are recognized in net sales.

Annual Maintenance Costs

Annual maintenance costs for major planned maintenance shutdowns (in excess of $1 million) are expensed ratably over the year in which the maintenance shutdowns occur since the Company believes that operations benefit throughout the year from the maintenance work performed. These costs, including manufacturing variances and out-of- pocket costs that are directly related to the shutdown, are fully expensed in the year of the shutdown with no amounts remaining accrued at year-end. Other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Temporary Investments

Temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less are treated as cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which approximates market.

Inventories

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and includes all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. In the United States, costs of raw materials, finished lumber and panels and finished pulp and paper products are generally determined using the last-in, first-out method. Other inventories are valued using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods.

Plants, Properties and Equipment

Plants, properties and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for betterments are capitalized whereas normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The units-of-production method of depreciation is used for major pulp and paper mills and certain wood products facilities and the straight-line method for other plants and equipment. Annual straight-line depreciation rates are, for buildings, 2 1/2% to 8 1/2%, and, for machinery and equipment, 5% to 33%.

Forestlands

At December 31, 2004, International Paper and its subsidiaries owned or controlled about 6.8 million acres of forestlands in the United States, 1.2 million acres in Brazil, 785,000 acres in New Zealand, and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government-owned forestlands in Russia. Forestlands include owned property as well as certain timber harvesting rights


with
        terms of one or more years, and are stated at cost, less cost of timber
        harvested (COTH). Costs attributable to timber are charged against income
        as trees are cut. The rate charged is determined annually based on the
        relationship of incurred costs to estimated current merchantable volume.

Effective
        January 1, 2002, International Paper prospectively changed its method
        of accounting for mid-rotation fertilization expenditures to include such
        expenditures in the capitalized cost of forestlands. Accordingly, these
        costs are included as part of the COTH as trees are sold.

Goodwill

Effective
        January 1, 2002, International Paper adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards (SFAS) No. 142. As required by SFAS No. 142, an initial assessment
        of recorded goodwill for possible impairment was conducted as of January
        1, 2002. Annual testing for possible goodwill impairment is performed
        as of the end of the third quarter of each year. A transitional impairment
        charge of $1.2 billion, including all of the goodwill associated with
        CHH, was recorded upon the initial adoption of this standard in 2002.
        In addition, CHH recorded $35 million of goodwill upon its acquisition
        of Plantation Timber Products which was written off by International Paper
        following an impairment evaluation in 2004 (see Note 5). No impairment
        charges were recorded in 2003.

Goodwill
        relating to a single business reporting unit is included as an asset of
        the applicable segment while goodwill arising from major acquisitions
        that involve multiple business segments is classified as a corporate asset
        for segment reporting purposes. For goodwill impairment testing, this
        goodwill is allocated to business segments.

Impairment
        of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived
        assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes
        in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may
        not be recoverable, as measured by comparing their net book value to their
        projected undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use. Impaired
        assets are recorded at their estimated fair value.

Income
        Taxes

International
        Paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes
        whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences
        attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases
        of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
        using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
        those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred
        tax assets and liabilities are revalued to reflect new tax rates in the
        periods rate changes are enacted.

International
        Paper records its worldwide tax provision based on the respective tax
        rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Where
        the Company believes that the deduction of an item is supportable for
        income tax purposes, the item is deducted in its income tax returns. However,
        where treatment of an item is uncertain, tax accruals are recorded based
        upon the expected most probable outcome taking into consideration the
        specific tax regulations and facts of each matter, the results of historical
        negotiated settlements, and the results of consultations with outside
        tax advisors. These accruals for tax contingencies are recorded in the
        accompanying consolidated balance sheet in Other liabilities. Changes
        to the reserves are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes
        the probable outcome, such as a settlement with relevant tax authority,
        the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change
        in tax laws, or a relevant court decision that addresses the matter.

While
        the Company believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate
        and reasonable under current circumstances, actual resolution of these
        matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.

Stock-Based
        Compensation

Stock
        options and other stock-based compensation awards are accounted for using
        the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB)
        Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,”
        and related interpretations.

Had
        compensation cost for International Paper’s stock-based compensation
        programs been determined consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123,
        its net earnings, earnings per common share and earnings per common share
        - assuming dilution would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated
        in the following table:

        assuming dilution of expensing the estimated fair market value of stock
        options is not necessarily representative of the effect on reported earnings
        for future years due to the vesting period of stock options and the potential
        for issuance of additional stock-based compensation.

Environmental
        Remediation Costs

Costs
        associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when
        such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. Such accruals are adjusted
        as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future
        expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are discounted
        to their present value when the amount and timing of expected cash payments
        are reliably determinable.

Asset
        Retirement Obligations

In
        accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
        Retirement Obligations,” adopted effective January 1, 2003 (see Note
        4), a liability and an asset are recorded equal to the present value of
        the estimated costs associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
        where a legal or contractual obligation exists. The liability is accreted
        over time and the asset is depreciated over the life of the related equipment
        or facility. International Paper’s asset retirement obligations under
        this standard relate to closure costs for landfills. Revisions to the
        liability could occur due to changes in the estimated costs or timing
        of closures, or possible new federal or state regulations affecting these
        closures.

Translation
        of Financial Statements

Balance
        sheets of international operations are translated into U.S. dollars at
        year-end exchange rates, while statements of operations are translated
        at average rates. Adjustments resulting from financial statement translations
        are included as cumulative translation adjustments in Accumulated other
        comprehensive income (loss) (OCI). See Note 13 related to derivatives
        and hedging activities.

Reclassifications

Certain
        reclassifications have been made to prior-year amounts to conform to the
        current year presentation.

NOTE
        2      EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

Earnings
        per common share from continuing operations before the cumulative effect
        of accounting changes are computed by dividing earnings from continuing
        operations before the cumulative effect of accounting changes by the weighted
        average number of common shares outstanding. Earnings per common share
        from continuing operations

before
        the cumulative effect of accounting changes, assuming dilution, are computed
        assuming that all potentially dilutive securities, including “in-the-money”
        stock options, are converted into common shares at the beginning of each
        year. In addition, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004, the computation
        of diluted earnings per share reflects the inclusion of contingently convertible
        securities in periods when dilutive (see “Information About Capital
        Structure – Contingently Convertible Securities” in Note 4).
        Furthermore, as required by the recent consensus of the Emerging Issues
        Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the computations
        of diluted earnings per share for all prior periods have been restated
        on this basis.

A
        reconciliation of the amounts included in the computation of earnings
        per common share from continuing operations before the cumulative effect
        of accounting changes, and earnings per common share from continuing operations
        before the cumulative effect of accounting changes, assuming dilution,
        is as follows:

NOTE
        3       INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION

Financial information by industry segment and geographic area for 2004, 2003 and 2002 is presented on pages 33 and 34.

NOTE
        4       RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Share-Based
        Payment Transactions:

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” which will require compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements. The amount of the compensation cost will be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. In addition, liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period. Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. This statement will apply to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date. FASB Statement No. 123(R) replaces FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and will be effective for International Paper in the third quarter of 2005. Since, beginning in 2005, stock option grants will be limited only to certain non-U.S. employees, the provisions of this statement will mainly affect only previously issued options that are still outstanding and unvested on the effective date, as well as reload grants. While the exact impact on expense will depend upon the number of remaining unvested options at that time, the adoption of this standard could increase pre-tax compensation expense by approximately $20 million in both 2005 and 2006, with no significant impact on the Company’s financial statements in subsequent years.

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets:

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,” which replaces the exception from fair value measurement in APB Opinion No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions,” for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets with a general exception from fair value measurement for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. This statement is to be applied prospectively and will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. International Paper believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

Accounting
        for Income Taxes:

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act)” that provides tax relief to U.S. domestic manufacturers. The FSP states that the manufacturers’ deduction provided for under the Act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with Statement 109 rather than as a tax rate reduction.

Also in December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,” addressing accounting and disclosure guidance relating to a company’s repatriation program. The additional disclosures required under this staff position are included in Note 9, Income Taxes.

Both FSP’s were effective upon issuance.

Inventory
        Costs:

In
        November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an
        amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,” which requires that abnormal
        amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material
        be recognized as current-period charges. This statement also introduces
        the concept of “normal capacity” and requires the allocation
        of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity
        of the production facilities. Unallocated overheads must be recognized
        as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. This statement
        will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning
        after June 15, 2005. International Paper believes that the adoption of
        SFAS No. 151 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
        statements.

Accounting for Medicare Benefits:

In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106-2 that provides guidance on the accounting and required disclosures for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. International Paper adopted FSP FAS 106-2 prospectively in the third quarter of 2004. The impact was a reduction of net postretirement benefit cost of approximately $8 million for the last half of 2004 and a reduction of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $110 million. See Note 16 for further discussion.


Information about Capital Structure – Contingently Convertible Securities:

In April 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 129-1, Disclosure Requirements under FASB Statement No. 129, “Disclosure of Information about Capital Structure,” relating to contingently convertible securities and to their potentially dilutive effects on earnings per share. The FSP required expanded disclosures of the significant terms of the conversion features of these securities to enable users of the financial statements to understand the circumstances of the contingencies and the potential impact of conversion. These additional disclosures are presented for International Paper’s contingently convertible securities in Note 12.

In October 2004, the FASB ratified a consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force of the FASB that, effective for periods ending after December 15, 2004, contingently convertible securities should be included in the computation of diluted earnings per share regardless of whether or not the market price trigger for issuance of the securities has been met. Furthermore, the calculation of diluted earnings per share for all prior periods presented should be restated to reflect this consensus. At December 31, 2004, International Paper had outstanding $2.1 billion principal amount at maturity of zero-coupon convertible senior debentures. The debentures are contingently convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion ratio of 9.5111 shares per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of debentures totaling approximately 20 million shares. See Note
12 for additional information. Accordingly, the calculation of diluted earnings per common share shown in Note 2 considers, when dilutive, the assumed conversion of these debentures for all periods presented.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities:

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51.” This interpretation changed existing consolidation rules for certain entities, those in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support.

The interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities (VIE’s) created after January 31, 2003, and to VIE’s in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. International Paper has neither entered into nor obtained an interest in any VIE’s after January 31, 2003. For VIE’s created before February 1, 2003, this interpretation was effective for the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. During December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46, FIN 46(R), with varying effective dates. International Paper

applied FIN 46(R) to its variable interest entities as of December 31, 2003.

As a result of the application of the provisions of FIN 46(R) during 2003, four entities that were required to be consolidated under prior accounting rules were deconsolidated, and one previously unconsolidated entity was consolidated, at December 31, 2003. The following paragraphs describe the entities affected by the new FIN 46(R) consolidation rules and the effects on International Paper’s December 31, 2003 financial statements:

(a)      A special purpose leasing entity that was formerly part of an operating lease arrangement between International Paper and a third party was determined to be a VIE and required to be consolidated by the Company. Plants, properties and equipment and Long-term debt of approximately $50 million that were formerly part of this operating lease arrangement were consolidated and a non-cash, after-tax charge of $3 million was recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change.

(b)      In connection with a forestlands sale in 2001, International Paper received notes having a value of approximately $480 million on the date of sale. During 2001, International Paper contributed the notes to an unconsolidated entity in exchange for a preferred interest in that entity valued at approximately $480 million, and accounted for this transfer as a sale of the notes for financial reporting purposes with no associated gain or loss. Also during 2001, the entity acquired approximately $561 million of other International Paper debt obligations for cash.

In December 2002, International Paper acquired an option to purchase the third party’s interest in the unconsolidated entity and modified the terms of the entity’s special loss allocation between the third party and International Paper. These actions required the entity to be consolidated by International Paper at December 31, 2002, resulting in increases in installment notes receivable (included in Deferred charges and other assets) of $480 million, Long-term debt of $460 million and Minority interest of $20 million.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, International Paper determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the entity under the provisions of FIN 46(R) and, accordingly, deconsolidated the entity effective December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2003, International Paper’s $530 million preferred interest in the entity has been offset against $530 million of International Paper debt obligations since International Paper has, and intends to effect, a legal right to net settle these two amounts.

Reclassifications:

(a)      The
        Printing Papers business approved a restructuring plan at the Maresquel,
        France plant in an effort to improve efficiencies. Charges associated
        with the plan included $1 million of asset write-downs to salvage value,
        $7 million of severance costs covering the termination of 80 employees
        and other cash costs of $1 million. Management also implemented a reduction
        in force initiative at several of its Coated and SC mills resulting in
        severance charges of $18 million covering the termination of 245 employees.
        Also, an additional charge of $1 million was recorded to write down the
        remaining assets at the Erie, Pennsylvania mill to salvage value.

(b)      The
        Industrial Packaging business recorded a charge of $3 million for severance
        costs relating to the Las Palmas, Canary Islands facility in the second
        phase of an effort to consolidate duplicative facilities and eliminate
        excess internal capacity. Redundancies associated with this charge included
        56 employees.

The
        Consumer Packaging business approved a plan to shut down the Hopkinsville,
        Kentucky Foodservice plant due to the facility’s financial shortfalls,
        a continuing weak economy, reduced demand from its Quick Service Restaurant
        (QSR)customers and increased competition for remaining QSR volumes. Charges
        associated with this shutdown included $10 million to write down assets
        to their estimated realizable value of $4 million, $3 million of severance
        costs covering the termination of 327 employees, and other exit costs
        of $1 million. The Hopkinsville plant had revenues of $47 million, $31
        million and $24 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This plant
        had operating losses of $8 million in 2002, $1 million in 2001 and zero
        in 2000. Management also implemented a business-reorganization plan for
        the Foodservice group that included $2 million to write down assets to
        salvage value, $3 million of severance costs covering the termination
        of 113 employees and other cash costs of $1 million. The Consumer Packaging
        charge also included $4 million of asset

The
        severance charges recorded in the first, second, third and fourth quarters
        of 2003 related to 3,343 employees. As of December 31, 2004, 3,305 employees
        had been terminated and 38 employees retained.

2002:

During 2002, restructuring and other charges
        before taxes and minority interest of $695 million ($435 million after
        taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included a $199
        million charge before taxes and minority interest ($130 million after
        taxes and minority interest) for asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity
        and cost reduction actions, a $450 million pre-tax charge ($278 million
        after taxes) for additional exterior siding legal reserves discussed in
        Note 10, and a charge of $46 million before taxes and minority interest
        ($27 million after taxes and minority interest) for early debt retirement
        costs discussed in Note 12. In addition, a $68 million pre-tax credit
        ($43 million after taxes) was recorded in 2002, including $45 million
        for the reversal of 2001 and 2000 reserves no longer required and $23
        million for the reversal of excess Champion purchase accounting reserves.

The
        $199 million charge in 2002 for the asset shutdowns of excess internal
        capacity and cost reduction actions consisted of a $101 million charge
        in the fourth quarter, a $19 million charge in the third quarter and a
        $79 million charge in the second quarter. The fourth-quarter charge included
        $29 million of asset write-downs and $72 million of severance and other
        charges. The third-quarter charge included $9 million of asset write-downs
        and $10 million of severance





Other Divestitures:

In
        December 2004, International Paper committed to plans for the sale in
        2005 of its Fine Papers business and its Maresquel mill and Papeteries
        de France distribution business in France. As a result, charges of $11
        million before taxes ($8 million after taxes), $34 million before and
        after taxes, and $11 million before taxes ($12 million after taxes), respectively,
        were recorded to write down the assets of these entities to their estimated
        fair values less costs to sell. In October 2004, International Paper sold
        two box plants located in China to International Paper Pacific Millennium,
        resulting in a pre-tax loss of $14 million ($4 million after taxes). Finally,
        also in the fourth quarter, a $9 million loss before taxes ($6 million
        after taxes) was recorded to adjust estimated gains/losses of businesses
        previously sold.

In July 2004, International Paper signed an agreement to sell Scaldia Papier B.V., and its subsidiary, Recom B.V. in the Netherlands, to Stora Enso for approximately $36 million in cash. This sale was completed in the third quarter and resulted in a loss of $34 million (no impact from taxes or minority interest). In addition, a $4 million loss (no impact from taxes or minority interest) was recorded to adjust the estimated loss on sale of Papeteries de Souche L.C. in France.

In the second quarter of 2004, a $27 million loss before and after taxes was recorded to write down the assets of Papeteries de Souche L.C. in France to their estimated realizable value. In addition, a $9 million loss before taxes and minority interest ($5 million after taxes and minority interest) was recorded to write down the assets of Food Pack S.A. in Chile to their estimated realizable value.

In the first quarter of 2004, a $9 million gain before taxes ($6 million after taxes) was recorded to adjust estimated gains/losses of businesses previously sold.

The net 2004 pre-tax losses totaling $144 million discussed above are included in Net losses (gains) on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, International Paper recorded a $34 million charge to write down the assets of its Polyrey business in France to their estimated fair value. In addition, a $13 million pre-tax gain ($8 million after taxes) was recorded to adjust estimated gains/losses of businesses previously sold.

In the third quarter of 2003, a $1 million charge before and after taxes was recorded to adjust estimated gains/losses of businesses previously sold.

In the second quarter of 2003, a $10 million pre-tax charge ($6 million after taxes) was recorded to adjust estimated gains/losses of businesses previously sold.

The net 2003 pre-tax losses, totaling $32 million, discussed above are included in Net losses (gains) on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, International Paper recorded a $10 million pre-tax credit ($4 million after taxes) to adjust estimated accrued costs of businesses previously sold.

In the third quarter of 2002, International Paper completed the sale of its Decorative Products operations to an affiliate of Kohlberg & Co. for approximately $100 million in cash and a note receivable with a fair market value of $13 million. This transaction resulted in no gain or loss as these assets had previously been written down to fair market value. Also during the third quarter of 2002, a net gain of $3 million before taxes ($1 million after taxes) was recorded related to adjustments of previously estimated accrued costs of businesses held for sale.

During the second quarter of 2002, a net gain on sales of businesses held for sale of $28 million before taxes and minority interest ($96 million after taxes and minority interest) was recorded, including a pre-tax gain of $63 million ($40 million after taxes) from the sale in April 2002 of International Paper’s oriented strand board facilities to Nexfor Inc. for $250 million, and a net charge of $35 million before taxes and minority interest (a gain of $56 million after taxes and minority interest) relating to other sales and adjustments of previously recorded estimated costs of businesses held for sale. This net pre-tax charge included:

(1)      a $2 million net loss associated with the sales of the Wilmington, North Carolina carton plant and CHH’s distribution business;

(2)      an additional loss of $12 million to write down the net assets of Decorative Products to fair market value;

(3)      $11 million of additional expenses relating to the decision to continue to operate Arizona Chemical, including a $3 million adjustment of estimated accrued costs incurred in connection with the prior sale effort and an $8 million charge to permanently close a production facility; and

(4)      a $10 million charge for additional expenses relating to prior divestitures.

The net tax credit associated with these charges reflects the reversal of an Arizona Chemical impairment tax charge in a prior period. The net 2002 pre-tax gains, totaling $41 million, discussed above are included in Net losses (gains) on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.


NOTE

PREFERRED
        SECURITIES OF

SUBSIDIARIES

In
        March 2003, Southeast Timber, Inc. (Southeast Timber), a consolidated
        subsidiary of International Paper, issued $150 million of preferred securities
        to a private investor with future dividend payments based on LIBOR. Southeast
        Timber, which through a subsidiary initially held approximately 1.5 million
        acres of forestlands in the southern United States, is International Paper’s
        primary vehicle for future sales of Southern forestlands. The preferred
        securities may be put back to International Paper by the private investor
        upon the occurrence of certain events, and have a liquidation preference
        that approximates their face amount. The $150 million preferred third-party
        interest is included in Minority interest in the accompanying consolidated
        balance sheet.

The
        agreement with the private investor also places certain limitations on
        International Paper’s ability to sell forestlands in the Southern
        United States outside of Southeast Timber. In addition, because Southeast
        Timber is a separate legal entity, the assets of Southeast Timber and
        its subsidiaries, consisting principally of forestlands having a book
        value of approximately $280 million at December 31, 2004, will not be
        available to satisfy future liabilities and obligations of International
        Paper, although the value of International Paper’s interests in Southeast
        Timber and its subsidiaries will be available for these purposes.

In
        September 1998, International Paper Capital Trust III issued $805 million
        of International Paper-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities.
        Prior to July 1, 2003, International Paper Capital Trust III was a wholly-owned
        consolidated subsidiary of International Paper (see Note 4). Its sole
        assets were International Paper 7.875% debentures. The obligations of
        International Paper Capital Trust III related to its preferred securities
        were unconditionally guaranteed by International Paper. In January 2004,
        International Paper redeemed these securities at par plus accrued interest.

In
        the third quarter of 1995, International Paper Capital Trust (the Trust)
        issued $450 million of International Paper-obligated mandatorily redeemable
        preferred securities. Prior to July 1, 2003, the Trust was a wholly-owned
        consolidated subsidiary of International Paper (see Note 4) and its sole
        assets were International Paper 5.25% convertible subordinated debentures.
        In February 2005, International Paper redeemed these securities at 100.5%
        of par plus accrued interest.

Effective
        July 1, 2003, as required by FIN 46, International Paper deconsolidated
        International Paper Capital Trust III and International Paper Capital
        Trust, holding approximately $1.3 billion of mandatorily redeemable preferred
        securities,

previously
        classified as a separate line item on the Company’s consolidated
        balance sheet, and recorded approximately $1.3 billion of borrowings from
        these trusts as Long-term debt.

In
        June 1998, IP Finance (Barbados) Limited, a non-U.S. wholly-owned consolidated
        subsidiary of International Paper, issued $550 million of preferred securities
        with a dividend payment based on LIBOR. These preferred securities were
        redeemed in June 2003 with the proceeds of debt issuances (see Note 12).

Timberlands
        Capital Corp. II, Inc., a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of International
        Paper, issued $170 million of 4.5% preferred securities in March 2003.
        These securities were not mandatorily redeemable and were classified in
        the consolidated balance sheet as a Minority interest. In November 2004,
        these securities became mandatorily redeemable and were reclassified from
        Minority interest to Current maturities of long-term debt pursuant to
        SFAS No. 150 and redeemed in December 2004 (see Note 12).

Distributions
        paid under all of the preferred securities noted above were $52 million,
        $111 million and $115 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
        expense related to these preferred securities is shown in Minority interest
        expense in the consolidated statement of operations, except for $32 million
        in 2004 and $44 million in 2003 included in Interest expense subsequent
        to the adoption of FIN 46 and reclassifications mandated under SFAS No.
        150.

reduction in the second quarter reflecting a favorable tax audit settlement and benefits from an overseas tax program.

During
        the fourth quarter of 2002, International Paper completed a review of
        its deferred income tax accounts, including the effects of state tax credits
        and the taxability of the Company’s operations in various state taxing
        jurisdictions. As a result of this review, the Company recorded a decrease
        of approximately $46 million in the income tax provision in the 2002 fourth
        quarter, reflecting the effect of the estimated state income tax effective
        rate applied to these deferred tax items.

International Paper has federal and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards
        that expire as follows: years 2005 through 2014 - $169 million, years
        2015 through 2024 - $2.7 billion, and indefinite carryforwards - $829
        million. International Paper has tax benefits from net operating loss
        carryforwards for state taxing jurisdictions of approximately $326 million
        that expire as follows: years 2005 through 2014 - $84 million, and years
        2015 through 2024 - $242 million.

International Paper
        also has federal, non-U.S. and state tax credit carryforwards that expire
        as follows: years 2005 through 2014 - $52 million, years 2015 through
        2024 - $119 million, and indefinite carryforwards - $405 million.

Deferred
        taxes are not provided for temporary differences of approximately $2.7
        billion, $2.5 billion and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and
        2002, respectively, representing earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that
        are intended to be permanently reinvested. Computation of the potential
        deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and
        other basis differences are not practicable.

International Paper is currently being audited by various federal, state and non-U.S. taxing authorities for the tax periods 1995 through 2003. Some of these audits are expected to conclude in 2005. The Company believes that it is adequately accrued for any possible audit adjustments. While the overall resolution of these examinations cannot be determined at this time, the Company may realize a tax benefit, the effects of which could be material to the reported operating results for any given period, if such positions are ultimately sustained.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act provides for a special one-time deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated. International Paper may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in 2005. As of December 31, 2004, International Paper has started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision, but does not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until the second quarter of 2005. While no repatriation decisions have been made as of December 31, 2004, the range of possible amounts that the Company is considering for

repatriation is between zero and $1.8 billion. The related potential range of deferred taxes that would have to be provided should a repatriation decision be made is between zero and $300 million.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Certain property, machinery and equipment are leased under cancelable and non-cancelable agreements. At December 31, 2004, total future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable leases were $918 million, due as follows: 2005 - $211 million; 2006 - $170 million; 2007 - $141 million; 2008 - $115 million; 2009 - $67 million; and thereafter - $214 million. Rent expense was $259 million, $262 million and $267 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Unconditional purchase obligations have been entered into during the ordinary course of business for the purchase of certain pulpwood, logs, wood chips, raw materials, energy and services. At December 31, 2004, total unconditional purchase obligations were $6,853 million, due as follows: 2005 - $2,723 million; 2006 - $447 million; 2007 - $354 million; 2008 - $337 million; 2009 - $292 million; and thereafter - $2,700 million.

International Paper entered into an agreement in 2000 to guarantee, for a fee, an unsecured contractual credit agreement of an unrelated third party customer. The guarantee, which expires in 2008, was made in exchange for a ten-year contract as the exclusive paper supplier to the customer. Both the loan to the customer and the guarantee are unsecured. Under the terms of the guarantee, International Paper could be required to make future payments up to a maximum of $110 million if the third party were to default under the credit agreement. There is no liability recorded on International Paper’s books for the guarantee. It is possible that payments may be required under this guarantee arrangement in the future, although it is uncertain how much or when such payments, if any, might be required.

In connection with sales of businesses, property, equipment, forestlands, and other assets, International Paper commonly makes representations and warranties relating to such businesses or assets, and may enter into indemnification arrangements with respect to tax and environmental liabilities, breaches of representations and warranties, and other matters. Where any liabilities for such matters are probable and subject to reasonable estimation, accrued liabilities are recorded at the time of sale as a cost of the transaction. International Paper believes that possible future unrecorded liabilities for these matters, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.


Exterior Siding and Roofing Litigation

Three nationwide class action lawsuits relating to exterior siding and roofing products manufactured by Masonite that were filed against International Paper have been settled in recent years.

The first suit, entitled

Judy Naef v. Masonite and International Paper

, was filed in December 1994 (Hardboard Lawsuit). The plaintiffs alleged that hardboard siding manufactured by Masonite fails prematurely, allowing moisture intrusion that in turn causes damage to the structure underneath the siding. The class consisted of all U.S. property owners having Masonite hardboard siding installed on and incorporated into buildings between January 1, 1980 and January 15, 1998. The Court granted final approval of the settlement on January 15, 1998. The settlement provides for monetary compensation to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a claims-made basis, which requires a class member to individually submit proof of damage to, or caused by, Masonite product, proof of square footage involved, and proofs of
various other matters in order to qualify for payment with respect to a claim. It also provides for the payment of attorneys’ fees equaling 15% of the settlement amounts paid to class members, with a non-refundable advance of $47.5 million plus $2.5 million in costs. Those amounts were paid to class counsel in 1998. For siding that was installed between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1989, the deadline for filing claims expired January 18, 2005, and for siding installed between January 1, 1990 through January 15, 1998, claims must be made by January 15, 2008.

The second suit, entitled

Cosby, et. al. v. Masonite Corporation, et. al.

, was filed in 1997 (Omniwood Lawsuit). The plaintiffs made allegations with regard to Omniwood siding manufactured by Masonite which were similar to those alleged in the Hardboard Lawsuit. The class consisted of all U.S. property owners having Omniwood siding installed on and incorporated into buildings from January 1, 1992 to January 6, 1999. The settlement relating to the Omniwood Lawsuit provides that qualified claims must be made by January 6, 2009 for Omniwood siding that was installed between January 1, 1992 and January 6, 1999.

The third suit, entitled

Smith, et. al. v. Masonite Corporation, et. al.

, was filed in 1995 (Woodruf Lawsuit). The plaintiffs alleged that Woodruf roofing manufactured by Masonite is defective and causes damage to the structure underneath the roofing. The class consisted of all U.S. property owners who had incorporated and installed Masonite Woodruf roofing from January 1, 1980 to January 6, 1999. The settlement relating to the Woodruf Lawsuit provides that for product installed between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1989, claims must be made by January 6, 2006, and for product installed between January 1, 1990 and January 6, 1999, claims must be made by January 6, 2009.

The Court granted final approval of the settlements of the Omniwood and Woodruf Lawsuits on January 6, 1999. The settlements provide for monetary compensation to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a claims- made basis, which requires a class member to individually submit proof of damage to, or caused by, Masonite product, proof of square footage involved, and proofs of various other matters. The settlements also provide for payment of attorneys’ fees equaling 13% of the settlement amounts paid to class members with a non-refundable advance of $1.7 million plus $75,000 in costs for each of the two cases. Those amounts were paid in 1999.

The liability for these matters was retained after the sale of Masonite to Premdor Inc. in 2001.

Claim Filing and Determination

Once a claim is determined to be valid under the respective settlement agreement covering the claim, the amount of the claim is determined by reference to a negotiated compensation formula established under the settlement agreements designed to compensate the homeowner for all damage to the structure. The compensation formula is based on (1) the average cost per square foot for product replacement, including material and labor as calculated by industry standards, in the area in which the structure is located, adjusted for inflation, or (2) the cost of appropriate refinishing as determined by industry standards in such area, adjusted for inflation. Persons receiving compensation pursuant to this formula also agree to release International Paper and Masonite from all other property damage claims relating to the product in question.

In connection with the products involved in the lawsuits described above, where there is damage, the process of degradation, once begun, continues until repairs are made. International Paper estimates that approximately 4 million structures have installed products that are the subject of the Hardboard Lawsuit, 300,000 structures have installed products that are subject to the Omniwood Lawsuit and 86,000 structures have installed products that are the subject of the Woodruf Lawsuit. Masonite stopped selling the products involved in the Hardboard Lawsuit in May 2001, the products involved in the Woodruf Lawsuit in May 1996, and the products involved in the Omniwood Lawsuit in September 1996.

Persons who are class members under the Hardboard, Omniwood and Woodruf Lawsuits who do not pursue remedies under the respective settlement agreement pertaining to such suits may have recourse to warranties, if any, in existence at the expiration of the respective terms established under the settlement agreements for making claims. The warranty period generally extends for 25 years following the installation of the product in question and,



Claims Activity


Insurance
        Matters

In
        November 1995, International Paper and Masonite commenced a lawsuit in
        the Superior Court of the State of California against certain of their
        insurance carriers (the Indemnification Lawsuit) because of their refusal
        to indemnify International Paper and Masonite for, among other things,
        the settlement relating to the Hardboard Lawsuit and the refusal of one
        insurer, Employer’s Insurance of Wausau (Wausau), to provide a defense
        of that lawsuit. During the fall of 2001, a trial of Masonite’s claim
        that Wausau breached its duty to defend (the Breach of Duty Lawsuit) was
        conducted in a state court in California. The jury found that Wausau had
        breached its duty to defend Masonite and awarded Masonite $13 million
        for its expense to defend the Hardboard Lawsuit; an additional $12
        million in attorneys’ fees and interest for Masonite’s expense
        to prosecute the Breach of Duty Lawsuit based on a finding that Wausau
        had acted in bad faith in refusing to defend the Hardboard Lawsuit and
        an additional $68 million in punitive damages. In a post-trial proceeding,
        the court awarded an additional $2 million in attorneys’ fees which
        Masonite had incurred in the trial of the Breach of Duty Lawsuit.

The
        trial of the Indemnification Lawsuit against 22 insurers (the Defendants)
        began in April 2003 to recover $470 million paid to claimants pursuant
        to the settlement of the Hardboard Lawsuit through May 2003. In July 2003,
        the jury determined that $383 million of International Paper’s payments
        to settle these claims are covered by its insurance policies (the Phase
        I Verdict). In the current phase of the case the court will determine
        how much of the $383 million can be allocated to the policies of the Defendants.
        The Company anticipates that, before a judgment is entered, the California
        court will also make a determination about indemnification for future
        claims based on the Phase I Verdict. The court will also determine whether
        amounts paid and to be paid to the plaintiff class counsel pursuant to
        the settlement of the Hardboard Lawsuit, and administrative expenses that
        have been and will be incurred in connection with that settlement, are
        covered by insurance.

A
        judgment has not yet been entered on the verdict in the Indemnification
        Lawsuit. It is difficult to predict when the judgment will be entered.
        This judgment will be subject to appeal when entered. Because of the uncertainties
        inherent in the litigation, including the outcome of any appeal, International
        Paper is unable to estimate the amount that it ultimately may recover
        against its insurance carriers.

The
        Company is presently engaged in court-ordered mediation with several of
        the Defendants.

During
        2004, International Paper reached settlements with Wausau, with respect
        to both the Indemnification and the

Breach
        of Duty Lawsuits, and with four other insurance companies under which
        International Paper received $164 million, including approximately $118
        million received in 2004, and an additional payment of $46 million in
        January 2005.

In
        addition, the Company has begun arbitration proceedings against American
        Excess Insurance Association and ACE Insurance Company, Ltd., to recover
        additional insurance proceeds.

As
        of December 31, 2004, International Paper had received an aggregate of
        $223 million in settlement payments from certain of its insurance carriers
        which had been named as defendants in the Indemnification Lawsuit or which
        otherwise provided International Paper with insurance coverage for hardboard
        siding.

Under
        an alternative risk-transfer agreement, International Paper contracted
        with a third party for payment in an amount up to $100 million for certain
        costs relating to the Indemnification Lawsuit if payments by International
        Paper with respect thereto exceeded a specified retention that was indexed
        to account for inflation over a several year period. The agreement with
        the third party was in excess of liability insurance recoveries obtained
        by International Paper, which are the subject of the separate litigation
        described above. Accordingly, International Paper believes that the obligation
        of the third party with respect to this agreement did not constitute “other
        valid and collectible insurance” that would either limit or otherwise
        affect the Company’s right to collect insurance available to it and
        Masonite under the insurance policies, which are the subject of the Indemnification
        Lawsuit. At December 31, 2001, International Paper had received the $100
        million from the third party.

A
        dispute between International Paper and the third party, concerning a
        number of issues, including the relationship of the contract funding obligation
        to insurance proceeds recovered in the Indemnification Lawsuit, was the
        subject of an arbitration commenced in 2002 by the third party in London,
        England and scheduled to begin in February 2004. Before the hearing started,
        the parties settled the dispute. Under the settlement, International Paper
        agreed to pay the third party a portion of insurance proceeds recovered
        by International Paper under its insurance policies, beginning on January
        1, 2004 and thereafter, up to a maximum of $95 million. The precise amount
        that International Paper will pay to the third party under the settlement
        will depend upon, and will be a specified portion of insurance recoveries
        received by International Paper after January 1, 2004. As of December
        31, 2004, approximately $32 million had been paid to the third party under
        this settlement.


Antitrust
        Matters

On
        May 14, 1999 and May 18, 1999, two lawsuits were filed in federal court
        in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against International Paper, the
        former Union Camp Corporation (acquired by International Paper in 1999),
        and other manufacturers of linerboard (the Defendants). These suits allege
        that the Defendants conspired to fix prices for corrugated sheets and
        containers during the period from October 1, 1993 through November 30,
        1995. These lawsuits, which seek injunctive relief as well as treble damages
        and other costs associated with the litigation, were consolidated and,
        on September 4, 2001, certified as a class action. On September 22, 2003,
        International Paper, along with Weyerhaeuser Co. and Georgia-Pacific Corp.,
        agreed with the class plaintiffs to settle the litigation for an aggregate
        amount of $68 million. The settlement, of which International Paper’s
        and Union Camp’s share totaled $24.4 million, was approved by the
        court in an order entered on December 10, 2003.

Twelve
        complaints with multiple plaintiffs who opted out of the class action
        described above, have been filed in various federal district courts around
        the country. These suits allege that the defendants conspired to fix prices
        for corrugated sheets and containers during the period from October 1,
        1993 through February 28, 1997. One opt-out plaintiff voluntarily dismissed
        its complaint on October 10, 2003. Another opt-out plaintiff settled its
        case. All of the remaining federal opt-out cases have been consolidated
        for pre-trial purposes in the federal court for the Eastern District of
        Pennsylvania. Discovery in the federal opt-out cases is currently scheduled
        to conclude in June 2005. Additionally, one opt-out case was originally
        filed in Kansas state court, but has been removed to federal court and
        transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The plaintiff in
        that case has filed a motion to remand the case to Kansas state court.
        The Company is vigorously defending these cases and believes it has valid
        defenses. However, due to the complexity of evaluating the factors upon
        which damages might be based (including, but not limited to, the uncertainties
        of the class period, defendants’ sales to various opt-out plaintiffs,
        and other defendants’ potential settlements), the Company cannot
        assess its potential exposure at this time.

In
        2000, purchasers of high-pressure laminates filed a number of purported
        class actions under the federal antitrust laws alleging that International
        Paper’s Nevamar division (which was part of the Decorative Products
        division) participated in a price-fixing conspiracy with competitors between
        January 1, 1994 and June 30, 2000. In 2000 and 2001, indirect purchasers
        of high-pressure laminates also filed similar purported class action cases
        under various state antitrust and consumer protection statutes in Arizona,
        California, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York,
        North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota,

Tennessee,
        West Virginia, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. In the third quarter
        of 2002, International Paper completed the sale of the Decorative Products
        operations, but retained any liability for these cases. In June 2003,
        the federal district court certified the consolidated federal cases as
        a class action. In 2004, the federal and all of the state cases were settled
        for a total of $38.5 million. The federal settlement has been approved
        by the court, and the state cases have all received preliminary approval
        and are proceeding toward final approval.

On
        September 16, 2002, International Paper was served in Federal District
        Court in Columbia, South Carolina with a class action lawsuit by a group
        of private landowners alleging that International Paper and certain of
        its fiber suppliers, known as Quality Suppliers, engaged in an unlawful
        conspiracy to artificially depress the prices at which International Paper
        procures fibers for its mills. The suit seeks injunctive relief as well
        as treble damages and other costs associated with the litigation. On March
        31, 2004, the case was certified as a class action. International Paper
        then asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for permission
        to appeal the District Court’s order granting class certification,
        but that request was denied. Discovery and issues concerning class notice
        are ongoing. On January 10, 2005, with the District Court’s approval,
        International Paper filed motions requesting dismissal of the plaintiffs’
        claim based on plaintiffs’ lack of standing to sue and decertification
        of the class. The motions are scheduled for hearing on April 7, 2005.

In
        May 2004, the press reported that European, U.S. and Canadian antitrust
        authorities were investigating possible cartel activity relating to publication
        papers. Following these press reports, a number of private plaintiffs
        filed purported class actions on behalf of purchasers of publication papers
        in various U.S. federal and state courts. These class actions allege that
        manufacturers of publication papers, including International Paper, participated
        in a price fixing consipiracy from 1993 to the present. The cases filed
        in federal court assert a violation of the federal antitrust laws, while
        the cases filed in the state court allege violations of state antitrust
        and consumer protection statutes. These lawsuits seek injunctive relief,
        as well as treble damages and other costs associated with the litigation.
        The federal cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in December
        2004 in the federal court for the District of Connecticut. Discovery and
        related pretrial proceedings have not yet begun. Discovery in the state
        cases is expected to be coordinated with the consolidated federal cases.
        The Company believes it has valid defenses and intends to vigorously defend
        these cases. However, at this early stage the Company cannot assess its
        potential exposure.



The following table presents an analysis of activity related to asset retirement obligations since January 1, 2003:

NOTE 12 DEBT AND LINES OF CREDIT

In December 2004, Timberlands Capital Corp. II, Inc., a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of International Paper, redeemed $170 million of 4.5% preferred securities. In November 2004, these preferred securities were reclassified from Minority interest to Current maturities of long-term debt pursuant to SFAS No. 150. Additionally during the fourth quarter of 2004, International Paper redeemed approximately $295 million of mostly domestic debt, including $108 million of 9.77% notes with a maturity date in December 2009 and $88 million of 6.9% industrial development bonds with a maturity date in August 2022.

In November 2004, CHH borrowed $425 million under their multi-currency and commercial paper credit facilities at interest rates ranging from 5.5% to 6.8% to be repaid during 2005. The proceeds from the borrowings were used to repay approximately $305 million of 8.875% notes with a maturity date in December 2004 and to settle maturing cross-currency and interest rate swaps.

In
        August 2004, an International Paper wholly-owned subsidiary issued 500
        million of Euro-denominated long-term debt (equivalent to approximately
        $619 million at issuance) with an initial interest rate of EURIBOR plus
        55 basis points that can vary depending upon the credit rating of the
        Company and a maturity date in August 2009. Also in August 2004, International
        Paper repurchased $168 million of limited partnership interests in Georgetown
        Equipment Leasing Associates, L.P. and Trout Creek Equipment Leasing,
        L.P. In June 2004, these partnership interests had been reclassified from
        Minority interest to Current maturities of long-term debt pursuant to
        SFAS No. 150. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2004, approximately
        $500 million of debt was redeemed, including $150 million of 8.125% notes
        with a maturity date in June 2024 and $193 million of debt assumed in
        connection with the Box USA acquisition.

In June 2004, an International Paper wholly-owned subsidiary issued $650 million of long-term debt with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 62.5 basis points that can vary depending upon the credit rating of the Company and a maturity date in June 2007, which refinanced $650 million of long-term debt with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points and a maturity date in August 2004.

In March 2004, International Paper issued $600 million of 4.00% notes due April 2010 and $400 million of 5.25% notes due April 2016. The proceeds from these issuances were used in April 2004 to retire approximately $1.0 billion of 8.125% coupon rate debt with an original maturity date in July 2005.

In August 2004, Carter Holt Harvey used a portion of the funds generated in connection with the second quarter sale of its Tissue business to repurchase shares from its shareholders, including approximately $158 million that was paid to minority shareholders.

In December 2004, International Paper completed the sale of 1.1 million acres of forestlands in Maine and New Hampshire to a private forest investment company for $244 million. Since International Paper has some continuing interest in these forestlands through a long-term fiber supply agreement, no gain was recognized in 2004 on this transaction. However, the net cash proceeds from the transaction of approximately $242 million are included as a source of cash in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows. The deferred gain on the transaction totaling $114 million at December 31, 2004, included in Other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, will be amortized to earnings in future periods over the term of the fiber supply agreement.


A pre-tax early debt retirement expense of $92 million related to the above 2004 redemptions is included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In December 2003, International Paper completed a private placement with registration rights of $500 million of 4.25% notes due in January 2009 and $500 million of 5.50% notes due in January 2014. The net proceeds from the notes were used in January 2004 for the redemption of all of the outstanding $805 million aggregate principal amount of International Paper Capital Trust III 7.875% preferred securities originally due in December 2038 and for the repayment or early retirement of other debt.

In conjunction with the Company’s adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46(R) (see Note 4), Long-term debt at December 31, 2003 (1) increased by $50 million due to the consolidation of an entity that was formerly treated as an operating lease arrangement; (2) decreased by $460 million due to the deconsolidation of an entity that had previously been consolidated; and (3) increased by a net $100 million upon the deconsolidation of an entity created in June 2002. The net $100 million increase included an addition to debt of $450 million representing International Paper’s obligations to the deconsolidated entity and a reduction of $350 million due to the deconsolidation of third-party debt owed by the entity.

Also, related to the application of FIN 46 to certain entities, effective July 1, 2003, International Paper deconsolidated two trusts with holdings of approximately $1.3 billion of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities, previously classified as a separate line item on the Company’s balance sheet, and recorded approximately $1.3 billion of borrowings from the trusts as Long-term debt.

In December 2003, International Paper exercised its option to redeem the securities of one of the trusts effective in January 2004, and consequently, reclassified $830 million to Current maturities of long-term debt. In February 2005, International Paper redeemed the preferred securities of the remaining trust, which were classified in Long-term debt at December 31, 2004.

The implementation of FIN 46 and FIN 46(R) had no adverse affect on existing debt covenants.

In March 2003, International Paper completed a private placement with registration rights of $300 million of 3.80% notes due in April 2008 and $700 million of 5.30% notes due in April 2015. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay approximately $450 million of commercial paper and long-term debt and to redeem $550 million of preferred securities of IP Finance (Barbados) Limited, a non-U.S. consolidated subsidiary of International Paper.

A pre-tax early debt retirement expense of $1 million related to the 2003 redemptions discussed above is included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In October 2002, International Paper completed a private placement with registration rights of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.85% notes due in October 2012. In November 2002, the sale of an additional $200 million principal amount of 5.85% notes due in October 2012 was completed. The net proceeds of these sales were used to refinance most of International Paper’s $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 8% notes due in July 2003, that were issued in connection with the Champion acquisition. The pre- tax early debt retirement cost of $41 million is included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

Also during 2002, approximately $1.8 billion of long-term debt was repaid, including about $800 million of Champion acquisition debt. Increases in 2002 included approximately $800 million from new borrowings, and non-cash increases of approximately $620 million, including $460 million relating to the consolidation of a debt obligation of a special purpose entity following the modification of the terms of the related agreement.


A summary of long-term debt follows:

Total maturities of long-term debt over the next five years are 2005 - $506 million; 2006 - $882 million; 2007 - $1.2 billion; 2008 - $326 million; and 2009 - $1.3 billion.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, International Paper classified $87 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, of tenderable bonds, commercial paper and bank notes and Current maturities of long-term debt as Long-term debt. International Paper has the intent and ability to renew or convert these obligations, as evidenced by the available bank credit agreements described below.

At December 31, 2004, International Paper’s unused contractually committed bank credit agreements amounted to $3.2 billion. The agreements generally provide for interest rates at a floating rate index plus a pre-determined margin dependent upon International Paper’s credit rating. In March 2004, International Paper replaced its maturing $750 million bank credit agreement with a five-year, $1.25 billion bank credit facility maturing in March 2009. Concurrently, an existing three-year bank credit agreement maturing in March 2006 was reduced from $1.5 billion to $750 million. These agreements have a facility fee of 0.15% that is payable quarterly. In addition, in November 2004, International Paper amended its receivables securitization program established in December 2001 to increase the line of credit from $650 million to $1.2 billion of commercial paper-based
financings, based on the amount of qualifying receivables. The program extends through November 2007 with a facility fee of 0.20%. There were no borrowings under either the bank credit agreements or receivables securitization program at December 31, 2004.

In November 2004, CHH entered into a short-term multi- currency credit facility with a NZ$400 million line of credit that extends through August 2005 with a facility fee of 0.05%. Also, CHH has an existing NZ$ 325 million multi-currency credit facility that supports its commercial paper program. This facility matures in two tranches from 2006 to 2008. The facility fee ranges from 0.27% to 0.32% at current credit ratings and is payable quarterly. The unused portion of these facilities at December 31, 2004 amounted to approximately NZ$344 million.

At December 31, 2004, outstanding debt included approximately $227 million of commercial paper and bank notes with interest rates that fluctuate based on market conditions and the Company’s credit rating.

Maintaining a strong investment-grade rating is an important element of International Paper’s corporate finance strategy. At December 31, 2004, the Company held long-term credit ratings of BBB (negative outlook) and Baa2 (negative outlook) by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), respectively. The Company currently has short-term credit ratings by S&P and Moody’s of A-3 and P-2, respectively.

Contingently Convertible Securities

Included in debt at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $2.1 billion principal amount at maturity of zero-coupon convertible senior debentures with a 20-year term. This debt accretes to face value at maturity at a rate of 3.75% per annum. Beginning on June 20, 2004, and every June 20th and December 20th until maturity, the debentures are subject to an increased accretion rate if the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock is equal to or less than 60% of the then current conversion price of the notes for any 20 trading days out of the last 30 consecutive trading days ending three business days prior to June 20, 2004, or later semiannual date. The conversion price of the notes as of December 31, 2004 was $56.96, and the bonds were not subject to an increased accretion rate for the semiannual period beginning December 20, 2004.

These debentures may be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion ratio of 9.5111 shares per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of debentures, which was equal to an initial conversion price of $50.01 per share of the Company’s common stock. The debenture holders may convert their debentures into the Company’s common stock prior to maturity under any of the following circumstances: (1) the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the day prior to the surrender date is more than 120% (declining by .256% at the end of each semi-annual period over the life of the debentures to 110%) of the then-current conversion price; (2) International Paper’s credit rating is downgraded by each of Moody’s and S&P to below Baa3 and BBB-,
respectively; (3) the Company has called the notes for redemption; (4) the Company distributes to all holders of the Company’s common stock certain rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days, common stock at less than the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock at the time; or (5) the Company distributes to all holders of our common stock, the assets, debt securities or certain rights to purchase the Company’s debt securities, which distribution has a per share value exceeding 12.5% of the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on the day preceding the declaration for such distribution.

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004, as required by a recent FASB consensus, the dilutive effect of the convertible notes has been reflected in diluted earnings per share in periods when dilutive (see the caption “Information About Capital Structure – Contingently Convertible Securities” in Note 4), with prior periods restated.

Security holders have the right to require repurchase of these securities on June 20th in each of the years 2006, 2011 and 2016, at a repurchase price equal to the accreted principal

amount to the repurchase date. The repurchase may be for International Paper common stock or cash, or a combination of both, at the Company’s option.

International Paper also has the option to redeem the securities for cash after June 19, 2006. On or after June 20, 2006 and prior to June 20, 2008, the redemption may only occur if the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock exceeds 120% of the then-current conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the date redemption notice is given. On or after June 20, 2008, the redemption price will be equal to the then-accreted principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid cash interest to the redemption date.

NOTE 13

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

International Paper periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and currency risks. For hedges that meet the criteria under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” International Paper, at inception, formally designates and documents the instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. Because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. Derivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, determined using available
market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies, in other current or noncurrent assets or liabilities. The earnings impact resulting from the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as the underlying exposure being hedged. The financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. The ineffective portion of a financial instrument’s change in fair value, if any, would be recognized currently in earnings together with the changes in fair value of any derivatives not designated as hedges.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate swaps may be used to manage interest rate risks associated with International Paper’s debt. Some of these instruments qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and others do not. Interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount at December 31,


2004 of approximately $500 million and maturities ranging from two to 19 years do not qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133 and, consequently, were recorded at fair value on the transition date by a pre-tax charge of approximately $20 million to earnings in 2001 upon adoption of SFAS No. 133. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the change in fair value of these swaps was immaterial.

The remainder of International Paper’s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fully effective fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, outstanding  notional amounts for its interest rate swap fair value hedges amounted to approximately $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. The fair values of these swaps were net assets of approximately $70 million and $113 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In 2004, International Paper cash settled interest rate swaption contracts for a loss of $10 million, which was recorded in earnings.

In April 2004, interest rate swaps with a notional value of $500 million were terminated in connection with the early retirement of International Paper’s $1.0 billion notes due in July 2005. The resulting gain of approximately $14 million is included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations (see Note 6).

In November 2002, interest rate swaps with a notional value of $550 million were terminated in connection with the early retirement of International Paper’s $1.2 billion notes due in July 2003. The resulting gain of approximately $6 million is included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations (see Note 6).

During 2002, International Paper entered into agreements to fix interest rates on an anticipated $1.15 billion issuance of debt. Upon issuance of the debt in the fourth quarter of 2002, these agreements generated a pre-tax loss of $2.8 million that was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). This amount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the bonds through October 30, 2012, yielding an effective interest rate of 5.94%.

Commodity Risk

To minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities, International Paper has used swap and option contracts to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices. Such cash flow hedges are accounted for by deferring the after-tax quarterly change in fair value of the outstanding contracts in OCI. On the date a contract matures, the gain or loss is reclassified into cost of products sold concurrently with the recognition of the

commodity purchased. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the reclassification from OCI to earnings was immaterial. For the years ended 2003 and 2002, the reclassifications to earnings were after-tax gains of $24 million and after-tax losses of $10 million, respectively. These amounts represent the after-tax cash settlements on the maturing energy hedge contracts. Unrealized after-tax losses of $2 million and after-tax gains of $12 million and $24 million were recorded to OCI during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. There were no outstanding energy hedge contracts as of December 31, 2004.

Foreign Currency Risk

International Paper’s policy has been to hedge certain investments in non-U.S. operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency, or by entering into long-term cross- currency and interest rate swaps or short-term foreign exchange contracts. These financial instruments are effective as a hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these instruments, which are offset in whole or in part by translation gains and losses on the non-U.S. operation’s net assets hedged, are recorded as translation adjustments in OCI. Upon liquidation or sale of the foreign investments, the accumulated gains or losses from the revaluation of the hedging instruments, together with the translation gains and losses on the net assets, are included in earnings. For the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, net losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment on derivative and debt instruments hedging foreign net investments amounted to $74 million, $89 million and $46 million after taxes and minority interest, respectively. Cumulative after-tax losses of $50 million on net investment hedges were included in the loss on sale of Weldwood in Discontinued operations in 2004.

Long-term cross-currency and interest rate swaps and short- term currency swaps have been used to mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates, affecting the fair value of debt denominated in a foreign currency. In 2004, CHH paid $180 million to settle these hedges concurrent with the repayment of the related debt. Prior to the settlement, the impact on earnings from the derivative revaluations were substantially offset by the earnings impact from remeasuring the foreign currency debt each period.

Foreign exchange contracts (including forward, swap and purchase option contracts) are also used to hedge certain transactions, primarily trade receipts and payments denominated in foreign currencies, to manage volatility associated with these transactions and to protect International Paper from currency fluctuations between the contract date and ultimate settlement. These contracts, most of which have
