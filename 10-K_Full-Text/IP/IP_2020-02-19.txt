INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY

INDEX TO ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2019


PART I.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

International Paper Company (the Company or International Paper, which may also be referred to as we or us) is a global producer of renewable fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper products with manufacturing operations in North America, Latin America, Europe, North Africa and Russia. We are a New York corporation, incorporated in 1941 as the successor to the New York corporation of the same name organized in 1898. You can learn more about us by visiting our website at www.internationalpaper.com.

In the United States, at

December 31, 2019

, the Company operated


pulp, paper and packaging mills,


converting and packaging plants,


recycling plants and

three

bag facilities. Production facilities at

December 31, 2019

in Canada, Europe, North Africa and Latin America included


pulp, paper and packaging mills,


converting and packaging plants, and

two

recycling plants. We operate a printing and packaging products distribution business principally through

six

branches in Asia. At

December 31, 2019

, we owned or managed approximately

329,000

acres of forestland in Brazil and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government-owned forestlands in Russia. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions.

For management and financial reporting purposes, our businesses are separated into three segments: Industrial Packaging; Global Cellulose Fibers; and Printing Papers.

A description of these business segments can be found on pages


and


of

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

. The Company’s equity interests in Ilim S.A. (Ilim) and Graphic Packaging International Partners, LLC (GPIP) are also separate reportable industry segments.

From 2015 through 2019, International Paper’s capital spending approximated

$7.1 billion

, excluding mergers and acquisitions. These expenditures reflect our continuing efforts to use our capital strategically to improve product quality and environmental performance, as well as lower costs and maintain reliability of operations. Capital spending in


was approximately

$1.3 billion

and is expected to be approximately

$1.0 billion

in

Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we “incorporate by reference” certain information in parts of other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC permits us to disclose important information by referring to it in that manner. Please refer to such information. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, along with all other reports and any amendments thereto filed with or furnished to the SEC, are publicly available free of charge on the Investor Relations section of our  website at www.internationalpaper.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we filed with or furnished to the SEC.

COMPETITION AND COSTS

The pulp, paper and packaging sectors are large and fragmented, and the areas into which the Company sells its principal products are very competitive. Our products compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies. We also compete, in some instances, with companies in other industries and against substitutes for wood-fiber products.

Many factors influence the Company’s competitive position, including price, cost, product quality and services. You can find more information about the impact of these factors on operating profits on pages

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Company operates its primary research and development center in Loveland, Ohio, as well as several other product development facilities, including a technology center in Federal Way, Washington.

We direct research and development activities to short-term, long-term and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions, and to process, equipment and product innovations. Activities include product development within the operating divisions; studies on innovation and improvement of pulping, bleaching, chemical recovery, paper making, converting and coating processes; packaging design and materials development; mechanical packaging systems, environmentally sensitive printing inks and reduction of environmental discharges; re-use of raw materials in manufacturing processes; recycling of consumer and packaging paper products; energy conservation; applications of computer controls to manufacturing operations; innovations and improvement of products; and development of various new products. Our development efforts specifically

address product safety, as well as the minimization of solid waste. The cost to the Company of its research and development operations was

$29 million

in


,

$30 million

in


and

$28 million

in


.

We own numerous patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights relating to our products and to the processes for their production. We also license intellectual property rights to and from others where advantageous or necessary. Many of the manufacturing processes are among our trade secrets. Some of our products are covered by U.S. and non-U.S. patents and are sold under well known trademarks. We derive a competitive advantage by protecting our trade secrets, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and by using them as required to support our businesses.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

International Paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation, as well as similar regulations internationally. In addition, new environmental laws or regulations impacting our facilities around the world are routinely passed or proposed. Our continuing objectives include:



(1) controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities to avoid adverse impacts on the environment, and (2) maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company spent $70 million in 2019 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water, and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste. We expect to spend $80 million in 2020 for environmental capital projects. Capital expenditures for 2021 environmental projects are anticipated to be approximately $85 million. Capital expenditures for 2022 environmental projects are estimated to be $65 million.

The Company has completed capital projects to meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Boiler MACT (maximum achievable control technology) regulations that require owners of specified boilers to meet revised air emissions standards for certain substances. Although certain aspects of litigation challenging all or portions of the Boiler MACT regulations remain open, we have not identified any additional Boiler MACT capital project expenditures that might result from resolution of the open issues.

The Company has been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Many of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources. While joint and several liability is authorized under CERCLA and equivalent state laws, as a practical matter, liability for CERCLA cleanups is typically allocated among the many PRPs. There are other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the Company’s current, closed or formerly-owned facilities, and recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet. For additional information regarding certain remediation actions, see

CLIMATE CHANGE

International Paper plays a significant role in responding to the climate change challenge. Our entire business depends upon the sustainability of forests. We transform renewable resources into recyclable products that people depend on every day. This cycle begins with sourcing renewable fiber from responsibly managed forests, and at the end of use our products are recycled into new products at a higher rate than any other base material. We endeavor to continue to lead the international business community in responsible forest stewardship to ensure healthy and productive forest ecosystems for generations to come. Our efforts to advance sustainable forest management and restore

forest landscapes are an important lever for mitigating climate change through carbon storage in forests. Furthermore, we use biomass and manufacturing residuals (rather than fossil fuels) to generate a substantial majority of the manufacturing energy at our mills.

In an effort to mitigate the impact of climate change various international, national and sub-national (regional, state and local) governmental actions have been or may be undertaken. Presently, these efforts have not materially impacted International Paper, but such efforts may have a material impact on the Company in the future.

INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS

The Paris Agreement, went into effect in November 2016 and continued international efforts and voluntary commitments toward reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs).  Consistent with this objective, participating countries aim to balance GHG emissions generation and sequestration in the second half of this century or, in effect, achieve net-zero global GHG emissions.

As part of the Paris Agreement, many countries established non-binding emissions reduction targets.  For instance, the U.S. made a non-binding commitment to hold GHG emissions 7% below 2005 GHG emissions levels by 2020 and 26% to 28% below by 2025. Other countries in which we operate made similar non-binding commitments. On August 4, 2017, the U.S. filed official notice to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Notwithstanding the notice of withdrawal by the U.S., the Company’s voluntary GHG reductions, which are set out in our annual Global Citizenship report, remain roughly in line with the percentages of the U.S. prior target reductions. It is not clear at this time what, if any, further reductions by the Company might be required by the countries in which we operate. Due to this uncertainty, it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of these agreements on the Company.

To assist member countries in meeting GHG reduction obligations, the EU operates an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Currently, we have two sites directly subject to regulation under Phase III of the EU ETS, one in Poland and one in France. Other sites that we operate in the EU experience indirect impacts of the EU ETS through purchased power pricing. Neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the EU ETS have been material to the Company, but they could be material to the Company in the future depending on how the Paris Agreement's non-binding commitments or allocation of and market prices for GHG credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years.



U.S. EFFORTS, INCLUDING STATE, REGIONAL AND LOCAL MEASURES

The U.S. Congress has not passed GHG legislation. The EPA manages regulations to:  (i) control GHGs from mobile sources by adopting transportation fuel efficiency standards; (ii) control GHG emissions from new Electric Generating Units (EGUs); (iii) control emissions from new oil and gas processing operations and (iv) require reporting of GHGs from sources of GHGs greater than 25,000 tons per year.

Several U.S. states, including states in which we operate facilities, have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of GHGs by companies and public utilities.  California, New York and Virginia have already enacted such programs, although these regulations have not, and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company.  We are monitoring proposed programs in other states, however it is unclear what impacts, if any, state-level GHG rules will have on the Company’s operations.

SUMMARY

Regulation of GHGs continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business. While it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding GHGs and climate change in the future, it is unclear when such actions will occur and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate Company costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future. In addition to possible direct impacts, future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on International Paper, such as higher prices for transportation, energy and other inputs, as well as more protracted air permitting processes, causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects. International Paper has controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the U.S. and in other countries where we operate. We regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the Company, its operations or financial condition, and whether we have any related disclosure obligations.

Additional information regarding climate change and International Paper is available in our 2018 Global Citizenship report found on our website at www.internationalpaper.com, though this information is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the SEC.

EMPLOYEES

As of

December 31, 2019

, we have approximately

51,000

employees, nearly

33,000

of whom are located in the United States. Of our U.S. employees,

approximately

23,000

are hourly, with unions representing approximately

14,000

employees. Approximately

11,000

of this number are represented by the United Steelworkers union (USW).

International Paper, the USW, and several other unions have entered into two master agreements covering various mills and converting facilities. These master agreements cover several specific items, including wages, select benefit programs, successorship, employment security, and health and safety.  Individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other subjects not covered by the master agreements.  If local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration, under the terms of the master agreements the local contracts will automatically renew with the same terms in effect. The master agreements cover the majority of our union represented mills and converting facilities. In addition, International Paper is party to a master agreement with District Council 2, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, covering additional converting facilities.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the exhibits hereto) that are not historical in nature may be considered “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are often identified by the words, “will,” “may,” “should,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “appear,” “project,” “estimate,” “intend,” and words of a similar nature. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and reflect management’s current views with respect to future events, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to: (i) the level of our indebtedness and changes in interest rates; (ii) industry conditions, including but not limited to changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, energy and transportation costs, competition we face, cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences, demand and pricing for our products; (iii) domestic and global economic conditions and political changes, including but not limited to changes in currency exchange rates, trade protectionist policies, downgrades in our credit ratings and/or the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit, issued by recognized credit rating organizations, (iv) the amount of our future pension funding obligations, and pension and health care costs; (v) unanticipated expenditures or other adverse developments related to the cost of compliance with existing and new environmental, tax, labor and employment, privacy, and other U.S. and non-U.S. governmental laws and regulations; (vi) whether we experience a material disruption at one of our

manufacturing facilities; (vii) risks inherent in conducting business through joint ventures; (viii) our ability to achieve the benefits we expect from, and other risks associated with, acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and other corporate transactions, (ix) information technology risks, and (x) loss contingencies and pending, threatened or future litigation, including with respect to environmental matters. These and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from such forward-looking statements are discussed in greater detail below in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could affect the accuracy of any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The Company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance. The Board of Directors exercises oversight of the Company’s enterprise risk management program, which includes strategic, operational and financial matters, as well as compliance and legal risks. The Audit and Finance Committee coordinates the risk oversight role exercised by the Board’s standing committees and management, and it receives updates on the risk management processes twice per year.

In addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (particularly in

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

), or in the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. If any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures.

RISKS RELATING TO INDUSTRY CONDITIONS

CHANGES IN THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION COULD AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.

We rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda and starch), energy sources (principally biomass, natural gas, electricity and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. The market price of virgin wood



fiber varies based upon availability and source. The global supply and demand for recycled fiber may be affected by trade policies between countries, individual governments' legislation and regulations, as well as changes in the global economy. In addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause significant fluctuations in recycled fiber prices. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. The availability of labor and the market price for fuel may affect our costs for third-party transportation. Our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.

THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE EXPERIENCE BOTH ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICES OF, AND THE DEMAND FOR, OUR PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. In addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber-based products and non-fiber substitutes. Moreover, consumer preferences are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, convenience and health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions. These consumer preferences affect the prices of our products. Consequently, our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products.

COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We operate in a competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally, in all of our operating segments. Product innovations, manufacturing and operating efficiencies, and marketing, distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results.

RISKS RELATING TO MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS

ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN GENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

General economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar

employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. In addition, volatility in the capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.

CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the United States in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. Specifically, Russia, Brazil, Poland, and Turkey, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities, are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world. Fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences or rulings, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions impacting matters such as sustainability, environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements, could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, outbreak of a widespread health epidemic, such as a coronavirus, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, could also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects, including if operations of our customers are adversely impacted. In this regard, while we do not currently expect that our financial results will be significantly and adversely affected by the COVID-19 virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, there continue to be significant uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 virus, including with respect to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and actions that may be taken by Chinese or other governmental authorities to contain the COVID-19 virus or to treat its impact, and the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak may impact our financial results, including as the result of its possible impact on the Chinese or global economy, is not certain.

Trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including governmental subsidies, tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over International Paper, may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries. Likewise, disruption in existing trade agreements or increased trade friction between countries (e.g., the U.S. and China), which can result in tariffs, could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders. In addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. For



example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad, and the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control and other non-U.S. government entities maintain economic sanctions targeting various countries, persons and entities. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.

THE LEVEL OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

As of

December 31, 2019

, International Paper had approximately

$9.8 billion

of outstanding indebtedness. The level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:

•

it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, dividends, share repurchases, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;

•

a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;

•

the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;

•

it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and

•

it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.

In addition, we are subject to agreements governing our indebtedness  that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants. A significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions, or other significant adverse developments with respect to our results of operations or financial condition, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives. Moreover, the restrictions associated with

these financial ratios and covenants may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted.  Additionally, despite these restrictions, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility and otherwise increase the risks associated with our indebtedness as noted above.

Moreover, certain of our variable rate debt uses the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021.  In addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets.  Additionally, uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt.

CHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS ISSUED BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FINANCING AND HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

Maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy, and a downgrade of the Company’s ratings below investment grade will likely eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper market, may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. The Company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the Company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow, including sale of assets, suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital.

Under the terms of the agreements governing approximately $1.4 billion of our debt as of

December 31, 2019

, the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade. As a result, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any such downgrade,



suspension or withdrawal of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.

DOWNGRADES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF BANKS ISSUING CERTAIN LETTERS OF CREDIT WILL INCREASE OUR COST OF MAINTAINING CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS AND MAY RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF DEFERRED TAXES.

We are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes, including those delivered to Temple-Inland in connection with Temple-Inland's 2007 sales of forestlands, may be downgraded below a required rating. Since 2007, certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced, or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement. As a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment, a number of the letter-of-credit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited. The downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the Company to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to $485 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained.  The deferred taxes are currently recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements.  See

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

for further information.

OUR PENSION AND HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FACTORS WHICH COULD CAUSE THESE COSTS TO CHANGE.

We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 (or later for certain acquired populations, as described in

Note 19. Retirement Plans

, on pages


through


, in

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

) and substantially all hourly union and non-union employees regardless of hire date. The Company has frozen participation under these plans for U.S. salaried employees, including credited services and compensation on or after January 1, 2019; however, the pension freeze does not affect benefits accrued through December 31, 2018.  We provide retiree health care benefits to certain former U.S. employees, as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former U.S. salaried employees. Our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and changes

in the number of retirees may impact pension costs in future periods. Likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs. Drivers for fluctuating health costs include unit cost changes, health care utilization by participants, and potential legislative impacts and government oversight.

OUR PENSION PLANS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERFUNDED ON A PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BASIS, AND OVER TIME WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS TO THE PLANS, REDUCING THE CASH AVAILABLE FOR OUR BUSINESS.

We record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. The benefit liability recorded under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” at

December 31, 2019

was

$1.6 billion

. The amount and timing of future contributions, which could be material, will depend upon a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS

MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS AT ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. A material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:

•

fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;

•

the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;

•

the effect of other severe weather conditions on equipment and facilities;

•

disruption in the supply of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs;

•

terrorism or threats of terrorism;

•

information system disruptions or failures due to any number of causes, including cyber-attacks;

•

domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our Company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world;



•

unscheduled maintenance outages;

•

prolonged power failures;

•

an equipment failure;

•

a chemical spill or release;

•

explosion of a boiler or other equipment;

•

damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities;

•

disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;

•

a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, such as the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in China, or any other public health crisis;

•

failure of our third party service providers and business partners to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments  and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed upon terms;

•

labor difficulties; and

•

other operational problems.

Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. If one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.

CERTAIN OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED BY JOINT VENTURES THAT WE CANNOT OPERATE SOLELY FOR OUR BENEFIT.

Certain operations in Russia are carried on by a joint venture, Ilim.  In joint ventures, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. In general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. In joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. In addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so we receive only our portion of those benefits.

WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, DIVESTITURES, CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS THAT WE HAVE PURSUED OR MAY PURSUE.

Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, capital investments and other corporate transactions that we may pursue and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions, and we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits. This failure could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets, which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net earnings. Among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who  place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does International Paper.

Corporate transactions of this nature which we may pursue involve a number of special risks, including with respect to our inability to realize our business goals with respect to such transactions as noted above, the focus of our management’s attention on these transactions and the assimilation of acquired businesses into our operations, the demands on our financial, operational and information technology systems resulting from acquired businesses, and the possibility that we may become responsible for substantial contingent or unanticipated legal liabilities as the result of acquisitions or other corporate transactions.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RISKS RELATED TO BREACHES OF SECURITY PERTAINING TO SENSITIVE COMPANY, CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE AND VENDOR INFORMATION AS WELL AS BREACHES IN THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO  MANAGE OPERATIONS AND OTHER BUSINESS PROCESSES.

Our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating and independent third party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers or joint venture partners, could become subject to employee error or malfeasance, cyber attacks by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social activist (hacktivist) organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events. Network, system, application and data breaches



could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with International Paper. Access to applications required to plan our operations, source materials, manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. Theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents. Any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business.

RISKS RELATING TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY CHANGE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS, AND THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and other government requirements -- including, among others, those relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, data privacy, tax, trade and health care. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and government requirements will not be changed, applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs.

For example, we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our environmental expenditures include, among other areas, those related to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater, including situations where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party.  Moreover, we may be directly impacted by, and are working to manage, the risks and costs to us, our customers and our vendors of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and the availability of energy and water resources. These risks include the potentially adverse impact on forestlands, which are a key resource in the production of our products, increased product costs and a change in the types of products that customers purchase. We also face risks arising from the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, deforestation, and land

use. These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets, or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. These risks could expose us to market, operational, and execution costs or risks. There can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. We could also incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.

Additionally, we are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and international privacy laws and regulations, including those pertaining to the handling of personal data, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). The GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, with respect to all member states of the European Union, includes operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data of EU residents that are partially different from those that had previously been in place and includes significant penalties for noncompliance. The CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, affords California residents and households expanded privacy protections. Moreover, governmental authorities around the world are considering, or are in the process of implementing, new data protection regulations.

Many of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application, interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims, changes to our business practices, data processing and security systems, penalties, increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses. The recently enacted laws often provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as private rights of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. IP proactively uses internal and external resources to monitor compliance with relevant legislation and continually evaluates and, where necessary, modifies its data processing practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws. Nevertheless, relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws, which could subject us to penalties and/or litigation. In addition, there is no assurance that our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors



on data privacy and data security, and the policies, procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper disclosure of personal data. Improper disclosure of personal data in violation of the GDPR, the CCPA and/or of other personal data protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.

As a final example, the application of tax law is subject to interpretation and is subject to audit by taxing authorities. Additionally, administrative guidance can be incomplete or vary from legislative intent, and therefore the application of the tax law is uncertain. While we believe the positions reported by the Company comply with relevant tax laws and regulations, taxing authorities could interpret our application of certain laws and regulations differently.  We are currently subject to tax audits in the U.S., Brazil, Poland, Russia and other taxing jurisdictions around the world.  In some cases, we have appealed and may continue to appeal, assessments by taxing authorities in the court system. As such, tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses, higher future tax expenses or the assessment of interest and penalties.

RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We are a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters, including with respect to environmental matters. In addition, we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in connection with our legal, regulatory or governmental proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if we become subject to any such loss contingencies in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial results.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs that involve significant risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”

The following generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussion of historical items in 2017, and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017, can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019, under Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Full-year 2019 net earnings were

$1.2 billion

(

$3.07

per diluted share) compared with net earnings of

$2.0 billion

(

$4.85

per diluted share) for full-year 2018.

International Paper delivered solid earnings and outstanding cash generation in 2019. Our performance demonstrates our ability to generate strong cash flow and the flexibility of the company to navigate well through a challenging global environment. While the U.S. economy remains healthy, during 2019 we managed through significant inventory headwinds and broader trade tensions that impacted our exports. Against this backdrop, we focused on optimizing our full value chain by strengthening commercial offerings in faster growing packaging segments, running our manufacturing system well and leveraging the flexibility of our mill and converting system. We continued to grow value for our shareholders with returns above our cost of capital for a tenth consecutive year. Our capital allocation choices were consistent with our framework. In 2019, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends of about $800 million and share repurchases of about $500 million. The Company also increased its dividend for the tenth consecutive year, reinforcing our policy of a strong and sustainable dividend. We also repaid approximately $1 billion of debt during 2019 as part of our commitment to a strong balance sheet and to maintain an investment

grade rating. We continued to invest strategically to strengthen our Industrial Packaging business. In our North American corrugated packaging business, we made targeted investments to enhance our capabilities and reinforce our strong position in the fastest growing segments. In our EMEA Packaging business, we completed selective acquisitions to expand our converting network around the Madrid, Spain mill. Lastly, in January 2020, we monetized approximately 19% of our investment in Graphic Packaging in exchange for $250 million.

Compared to 2018, the Company’s 2019 results reflect the impact of a challenging global environment, which resulted in price and mix being a headwind, mostly due to significant price pressure in export pulp and containerboard markets, as well as the price impact of index movements in our North American Industrial Packaging business. Volume negatively impacted 2019 results due to challenging export markets. In particular, export containerboard volume was impacted by unusually high customer inventories at the start of 2019 which took most of the year to normalize. Operations and costs were impacted by significant economic downtime, particularly in the first half of 2019, due to lower export shipments and our ability to reduce inventories across our North American Industrial Packaging system due to improved supply chain operations. Input costs were favorable for the full year, primarily from lower recovered fiber and energy costs. Even though wood costs moderated in the second half of 2019, they had a negative impact on earnings in 2019. Equity earnings decreased in 2019 due to lower Ilim earnings, driven by the challenging global pulp market dynamics.

Looking ahead to the first quarter 2020, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, in our Industrial Packaging business, we expect lower price and mix on the flow-through of prior price index movements.

Volume is expected to be seasonally lower in North America. Operations and costs are expected to be negatively impacted by the non-repeat of a favorable inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter, as well as higher unabsorbed fixed costs associated with the Riverdale mill conversion. Maintenance outage expense is expected to be higher, and input costs are expected to be higher seasonally. In our Global Cellulose Fibers business, we expect lower price and mix on the impact of prior price index movements. Volume is expected to improve driven by higher fluff pulp shipments. Operations and costs are expected to negatively impact earnings due to the non-repeat of favorable items recognized in the fourth quarter. Maintenance outage expenses are expected to increase while input costs are expected to remain stable. In our Printing Papers business, flow-through of prior negative price movement is expected to be offset by improved geographic mix. Volume is expected to be down mostly due to seasonally lower volumes in Brazil. Operations and costs are



expected to have a favorable impact on earnings mostly due to the non-repeat of an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter, as well as improved fixed cost absorption in North America. Maintenance outage expenses are expected to increase while input costs should remain stable. Lastly, we expect lower equity earnings from our Ilim joint venture on the non-repeat of the fourth quarter foreign exchange gain.

Looking ahead to the full-year 2020, we expect to generate solid cash flows despite earnings headwinds, by continuing to leverage the flexibility of the company to manage costs, capital spending and working capital. Earnings are expected to be negatively impacted by price carryover from 2019, as well as the impact of the January 2020 containerboard index movement. Earnings are also expected to be negatively impacted by higher planned maintenance outage expense and costs related to the Riverdale conversion, including unabsorbed fixed costs during the conversion process. We plan to offset anticipated inflation through deliberate improvement initiatives. The fundamentals of our packaging and fluff pulp businesses are solid - we believe we are well positioned to capture growth while continuing to optimize the Company’s value chain to position us with positive momentum as we navigate through 2020. Lastly, we intend to continue to make choices for the use of the Company’s strong cash generation that are consistent with our capital allocation framework in order to drive long-term value creation.

Adjusted Operating Earnings and Adjusted Operating Earnings Per Share are non-GAAP measures and are defined as net earnings from continuing operations (a GAAP measure) excluding special items and non-operating pension expense. Net earnings (loss) and Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders are the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The Company calculates Adjusted Operating Earnings by excluding the after-tax effect of non-operating pension expense, items considered by management to be unusual (special items) and discontinued operations from the earnings reported under GAAP. Adjusted Operating Earnings Per Share is calculated by dividing Adjusted Operating Earnings by diluted average shares of common stock outstanding. Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results. The Company believes that using this information, along with the most direct comparable GAAP measure, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations.

The following are reconciliations of Earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders to Adjusted operating earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders. Additional detail is provided later in this Form 10-K regarding the special items referenced in the charts below.



Cash provided by operations totaled

$3.6 billion

and

$3.2 billion

for


and


, respectively. The Company generated Free Cash Flow of approximately

$2.3 billion

and

$1.7 billion

in


and


, respectively. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is cash provided by operations. Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available, after reinvesting in the business, to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay dividends, repurchase stock, service debt and make investments for future growth. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. By adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the Company's ongoing underlying operational performance, we believe that free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods.

The following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations:

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Form 10-K as referenced above have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results calculated in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, because not all companies utilize identical calculations, the Company’s presentation of non-GAAP measures in this Form 10-K may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, including companies in the same industry as the Company.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Business Segment Operating Profits are used by International Paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. International Paper believes that using this information, along with net earnings, provides a more complete analysis of the results of operations by year.  Business Segment Operating Profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, excluding interest expense, net, corporate items, net, special items, net, and non-operating pension expense. Business Segment Operating Profits is a measure reported to our management for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to our business segments and assessing the performance of our business segments and is presented in our financial statement footnotes in accordance with ASC 280.

International Paper operates in three segments: Industrial Packaging, Global Cellulose Fibers and Printing Papers.



The following table presents a comparison of net earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to International Paper Company to its total Business Segment Operating Profit:

as the benefits from lower input costs ($78 million) and lower maintenance outage costs ($30 million) were more than offset by lower average sales price realizations and mix ($161 million), lower sales volumes ($118 million) and higher operating costs ($312 million).

The principal changes in operating profit by business segment were as follows:

•

Industrial Packaging’s operating profit of

$2.1 billion

was  $201 million lower than in

We may continue to repurchase shares under such authorization in open market transactions (including block trades), privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, restrictions in our debt documents, applicable securities laws requirements and other factors.   In addition, we pay regular quarterly cash



dividends and expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends in the foreseeable future.  Each quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and is subject to restrictions in our debt documents.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

While the operating results for International Paper’s various business segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes in International Paper’s operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in North America, Europe, Russia, Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East. (and were closely tied to general economic conditions in India prior to the sale of our controlling interest in International Paper APPM Limited, an India-based printing paper business, effective October 30, 2019).

Factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial non-durable goods production, consumer preferences, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels, and movements in currency exchange rates.

Product prices are affected by general economic trends, inventory levels, currency exchange rate movements and worldwide capacity utilization. In addition to these revenue-related factors, net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood, recycled fiber and chemical costs; energy costs; freight costs; mill outage costs; salary and benefits costs, including pensions; and manufacturing conversion costs.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The following tables present net sales and operating profit (loss) which is the Company's measure of segment profitability.

INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING

Demand for Industrial Packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods production, as well as with demand for processed foods, poultry, meat and agricultural products. In addition to prices and volumes, major factors affecting the profitability of Industrial Packaging are raw material and energy costs, freight costs, mill outage costs, manufacturing efficiency and product mix.

Industrial Packaging

net sales for


decreased

4%

to

$15.3 billion

compared with

$15.9 billion

in


. Operating profits in


were

9%

lower

than in


. Comparing 2019 with 2018, benefits from lower input costs ($124 million) and lower maintenance outage costs ($22 million) were more than offset by lower average sales price and an unfavorable mix ($61 million), lower sales volumes ($107 million) and higher operating costs ($179 million).

(a)    Includes intra-segment sales of $118 million for 2019 and $233 million for 2018.

North American Industrial Packaging's

sales volumes decreased in 2019 compared with 2018 for export containerboard, primarily due to customer destocking as customers exited 2018 with high inventory levels which persisted through the first half of 2019.  Box shipments were also lower, reflecting weaker demand and the impact of customer gains and losses. In 2019, the business took about 1.4 million tons of total maintenance and economic downtime compared with 0.5 million tons of total downtime in 2018. Average sales prices were significantly lower primarily due to lower export containerboard prices, which were partially offset by higher sales prices for boxes. Input costs were substantially lower, primarily for recycled fiber. Planned maintenance downtime costs were $23 million lower in 2019 than in 2018. Operating costs increased due to inflation, but were mostly offset by strong mill manufacturing operations. Earnings benefited from a favorable inventory valuation adjustment in 2019, compared with an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment in 2018.



Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2020, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, sales volumes for boxes are expected to be seasonally lower. Shipments of containerboard to export markets are also expected to be lower. Average sales margins for boxes are expected to be lower, reflecting the recent price index movements. Input costs, primarily for wood and energy, are expected to be relatively flat. Planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $90 million higher as we move into a high maintenance outage quarter. Operating costs are anticipated to be higher, reflecting the impact of unabsorbed fixed costs related to the Riverdale conversion.

EMEA Industrial Packaging's

sales volumes in 2019 were lower than in 2018, reflecting weaker economic conditions in Turkey and a slower fruit and vegetable season in Morocco. Average sales margins improved significantly in all regions driven by lower containerboard costs and stable sales prices for boxes. Other input costs were flat. Planned maintenance downtime costs were also flat. Operating costs were lower due to the ramp-up of the Madrid, Spain mill and the benefits of our optimization initiatives, partially offset by inflation in Turkey. Earnings also benefited from the box plant acquisitions completed in the first half of 2019. Earnings were negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, primarily in Turkey.

Entering the first quarter of 2020, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, sales volumes are expected to be seasonally higher. Average sales margins are expected to be slightly higher reflecting lower containerboard costs. Planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $3 million higher. Input costs should be stable. Operating costs are expected to be higher, driven by inflation.

Brazilian Industrial Packaging's

sales volumes increased in 2019 compared with 2018 for boxes and containerboard. Average sales margins improved reflecting higher average sales prices and a favorable mix. Input costs increased, primarily for utilities, recycled fiber, wood and chemicals. Operating costs were lower.

Planned maintenance downtime costs were $1 million higher in 2019, compared with 2018.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2020, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, sales volumes are expected to be lower for both boxes and containerboard. Average sales margins are expected to be stable. Input costs are expected to be flat. Operating costs are expected to be stable.

European Coated Paperboard's

sales volumes in 2019 compared with 2018 increased in both Europe and Russia. Average sales margins were higher reflecting higher average sales prices net of an unfavorable mix in Europe and higher average sales prices and a favorable mix in Russia. Input costs were stable as lower purchased pulp and energy costs in Europe were offset by higher energy costs in Russia and higher wood and chemicals costs in Europe. Planned maintenance downtime costs were flat. Operating costs were higher. Earnings were negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency impacts in both Europe and Russia.

Looking forward to the first quarter of 2020, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, sales volumes are expected to be stable as higher volumes in Europe are offset by lower volumes in Russia. Average sales margins are expected to be higher in both regions. Input costs are expected to be flat in Europe and higher in Russia, primarily for wood and chemicals. Maintenance outage costs are expected to be flat due to no outages in the fourth quarter and no planned outages in the first quarter. Operating costs are expected to be lower.

GLOBAL CELLULOSE FIBERS

Demand for Cellulose Fibers products is closely correlated with changes in demand for absorbent hygiene products, primarily driven by the demographics and income growth in various geographic regions. It is further affected by changes in currency rates that can benefit or hurt producers in different geographic regions. Principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency, raw material and energy costs, mill outage costs, and freight costs.

Global Cellulose Fibers

net sales for


decreased

10%

to

$2.6 billion

.

Operating profits in


were significantly lower than in


. Comparing 2019 with 2018, benefits from higher sales volumes ($3 million), lower input costs ($8 million) and lower maintenance outage costs ($16 million) were



more than offset by lower average sales price and mix ($216 million) and higher operating costs ($79 million).

Sales volumes in 2019 compared with 2018 were lower as higher market pulp volumes were more than offset by lower fluff pulp volumes. In 2019, the business took about 300,000 tons of total maintenance and economic downtime compared with about 180,000 tons of total downtime in 2018. Average sales margins were significantly lower, reflecting lower average pulp prices driven by very challenging supply and demand conditions outside the U.S. Average sales margins were also negatively affected by an unfavorable product mix reflecting a decrease in sales of fluff pulp. Input costs were flat. Planned maintenance downtime costs were $16 million lower in 2019. Operating costs increased primarily due to inflation and an unfavorable mill manufacturing mix. In Europe and Russia, sales volumes increased.  Average sales prices decreased significantly in both regions. Input costs were higher for wood, chemicals and purchased pulp in Europe and chemicals and energy in Russia. Planned maintenance downtime costs were flat.

Entering the first quarter of 2020, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher, primarily for fluff pulp. Average sales margins are expected to be lower, reflecting the impact of prior price index movement. Input costs are expected to be stable. Planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be $27 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating costs are expected to increase due to seasonality and higher distribution costs.  In Europe, sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher and stable in Russia. Average sales margins are expected to be be higher in both regions. Planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $7 million lower in the first quarter of 2020 in Europe and Rusia.

PRINTING PAPERS

Demand for Printing Papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity, direct mail volumes and, for uncoated cut-size products, with changes in white-collar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper. Principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency, raw material and energy costs, mill outage costs and freight costs.

Printing Papers

sales price realizations, net of mix ($116 million), were more than offset by lower sales volumes ($14 million), higher operating costs ($54 million), higher input costs ($54 million) and higher planned maintenance downtime costs ($8 million).

North American Printing Papers'

sales volumes for 2019 were lower than in 2018, primarily for commercial printing paper.  In 2019, the business took about 125,000 tons of total maintenance and economic downtime compared with about 48,000 tons of total downtime in 2018. Average sales margins improved due to the realization of sales price increases for both cutsize paper and rolls, net of an unfavorable geographic mix. Input costs were higher, primarily for wood. Planned maintenance downtime costs were $4 million higher in 2019. Operating costs were higher primarily due to inflation and an unfavorable manufacturing mix, mostly offset by lower distribution costs and favorable mill operations. Earnings were negatively impacted by an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment in 2019.

Entering the first quarter of 2020, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, sales volumes are expected to be lower, primarily for export markets. Average sales margins are expected to be stable. Input costs are expected to be stable. Operating costs are expected to be higher due to seasonality and inflation. Earnings are expected to benefit from the non-repeat of an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2019. Planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to increase by about $29 million in the first quarter of 2020.

(a)    Includes intra-segment sales of $42 million for 2019 and $13 million for 2018.

Brazilian Papers'

sales volumes for uncoated freesheet paper in 2019, were higher compared with 2018 for export markets but lower for domestic markets. Average sales margins were lower as higher average domestic sales prices were more than offset by lower average export sales prices and an unfavorable geographic mix. Input costs increased, primarily for virgin fiber, chemicals and energy. Manufacturing costs were lower, but were offset by higher other operating costs. Planned maintenance downtime costs were $1 million lower in 2019.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2020, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, sales volumes for uncoated



freesheet paper are expected to be seasonally lower. Average sales margins are expected to decrease, primarily due to an unfavorable geographic mix. Input costs are expected to be stable. Planned maintenance outage costs are expected to be about $3 million lower in the first quarter of 2020. Operating costs are expected to be lower.

European Papers'

sales volumes for uncoated freesheet paper in 2019 were higher in Europe and Russia compared with 2018.  Average sales margins increased for uncoated freesheet paper in both regions, reflecting the realization of price increases implemented throughout 2018 and 2019. Input costs were higher for wood and chemicals in Europe and chemicals and energy in Russia. Planned maintenance downtime costs were $3 million higher in 2019 than in 2018. Operating costs were higher. Earnings were negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency impacts in both regions.

Entering 2020, sales volumes for uncoated freesheet paper in the first quarter are expected to increase in Europe, but expected to decrease in Russia, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Average sales margins are expected to be lower in Europe and stable in Russia. Input costs should be higher in both regions, mainly for chemicals in Europe and wood and chemicals in Russia. Maintenance outage costs should be about $9 million lower due to no planned outages in the first quarter. Operating costs are expected to be lower.

On May 29, 2019, International Paper announced it had entered into an agreement to sell its controlling interest in its Indian Papers

business.  The transaction closed on October 30, 2019.

EQUITY EARNINGS, NET OF TAXES - ILIM

International Paper accounts for its investment in Ilim , a separate reportable industry segment, using the equity method of accounting.

The Company recorded equity earnings, net of taxes, related to Ilim of

$207 million

in


, compared with earnings of

$290 million

in


. Operating results recorded in


included an after-tax non-cash foreign exchange gain of

$32 million

, compared with an after-tax

foreign exchange loss of

$82 million

in


, primarily on the remeasurement of Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt.

Coming off of a strong market in 2018, sales volumes for the joint venture decreased by 3% in 2019

,

primarily for containerboard shipments to China, Russia and other export markets. Shipments of softwood pulp and hardwood pulp to China were slightly higher, but fell below prior year levels in Russia and other export markets. Average sales price realizations were significantly lower for sales of softwood pulp, hardwood pulp and containerboard in all markets. Input costs were higher, primarily for wood, chemicals and fuel. Distribution costs were negatively impacted by transportation tariffs and inflation. Ilim completed two major capital projects in 2019: the rebuild of the kraft linerboard line at its Bratsk mill and the modernization of a pulp line at the Ust Ilmsk mill. The Company received cash dividends from the joint venture of

$246 million

in


and

$128 million

in


.

Entering the first quarter of 2020, sales volumes are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2019, due to the seasonal slowdown in China.  Based on pricing to date in the current quarter, average sales prices are expected to decrease for softwood pulp, hardwood pulp and containerboard. Input costs and distribution costs are projected to be relatively flat.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

OVERVIEW

A  major factor in International Paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products. While changes in key operating cash costs, such as raw material, energy, mill outage and distribution, do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus on commercial and operational excellence, as well as our ability to tightly manage costs and working capital has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.

Use of cash during


was primarily focused on capital spending, debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases under the Company's share repurchase program.



CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES

Cash provided by operations, including discontinued operations, totaled

$3.6 billion

in


, compared with

$3.2 billion

for


. Cash provided by working capital components (accounts receivable, contract assets and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable and other) totaled

$342 million

in


, compared with cash used by working capital components of

$439 million

in


. Cash dividends received from equity investments were

$273 million

in


, compared with

$153 million

in


.

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES

Including discontinued operations, the cash outflow from investment activities in


decreased from


, as 2018 included higher capital spending. The Company maintains an average capital spending target around depreciation and amortization levels, or modestly above, due to strategic plans over the course of an economic cycle. Capital spending was

$1.3 billion

in


, or

98%

of depreciation and amortization, compared with

$1.6 billion

in


, or

118%

of depreciation and amortization. Across our segments, capital spending as a percentage of depreciation and amortization ranged from

61.6%

to

116.1%

in


.

The following table shows capital spending by business segment for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


.

Capital spending in


is expected to be approximately

$1.0 billion

, or

74%

of depreciation and amortization, including approximately

$250 million

of strategic investments. The expected reduction in capital spending in 2020 is primarily due to the completion of large strategic investments in our containerboard mill system, including the Madrid, Spain mill and the Riverdale mill conversions, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2020.

Acquisitions

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

for a discussion of the Company's acquisitions.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

Amounts related to early debt extinguishment during the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


were as follows:

(a)

Reductions related to notes with interest rates ranging from

3.00%

to

9.50%

with original maturities from


to


for the years ended December 31,


and


.

(b)

Amounts are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

2019:

Financing activities during 2019 included debt issuances of

$534 million

and reductions of

$1.5 billion

for a net decrease of

$973 million

.

In June 2019, International Paper issued $200 million of 3.55% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in 2029. The proceeds from this offering, together with a combination of available cash and other borrowings, were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and other existing indebtedness.

In October 2019, International Paper issued $127 million of environmental development bonds with interest rates ranging from 1.90% to 2.10% and maturity dates in 2024. The proceeds from this offering were used to repay other existing environmental development bonds.

In June 2018, the borrowing capacity of  the commercial paper program was increased from

$750 million

to

$1.0 billion

. Under the terms of the program, individual maturities on borrowings may vary, but may not exceed one year from the date of issuance. Interest bearing notes may be issued either as fixed notes or floating rate notes. As of

December 31, 2019

and 2018, the Company had

$30 million

and

$465 million

, respectively, outstanding under this program.

Other financing activities during 2019 included the net repurchase of approximately 8.5 million shares of treasury stock, including restricted stock tax withholding. Repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled  $535 million, including $485 million related to shares repurchased under the Company's share repurchase program. On October 9, 2018, the Company announced an authorization to repurchase $2 billion of the Company's common stock to supplement remaining amounts under prior share repurchase authorizations, bringing total share repurchase authorizations since 2013 to $5.0 billion. The Company will continue to repurchase such shares in open market repurchase transactions. Under the $5.0 billion share repurchase program, the Company has repurchased 68.9 million shares at an average price



of $47.23, for a total of approximately $3.3 billion, as of December 31, 2019.

In October 2019, International Paper announced that the quarterly dividend would be increased from $0.50 per share to $0.5125 per share, effective for the 2019 fourth quarter.

2018:

Financing activities during 2018 included debt issuances of

$490 million

and retirements of

$1.0 billion

for a net decrease of

$518 million

.

Other financing activities during 2018 included the net repurchase of approximately 12.3 million shares of treasury stock, including restricted stock tax withholding. Repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled  $732 million, including $700 million related to shares repurchased under the Company's share repurchase program.

In October 2018, International Paper announced that the quarterly dividend would be increased from $0.4750 per share to $0.50 per share, effective for the 2018 fourth quarter.

Interest Rate Swaps

International Paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and manage interest expense. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, International Paper had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of

$700 million

and maturities ranging from


to 2026 (see

Note 17 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

on pages


through


of

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

). During 2019 and 2018, the inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short-term investments reduced the effective interest rate from

4.8%

to

4.4%

and from

4.8%

to

4.6%

, respectively.

Variable Interest Entities

Information concerning variable interest entities is set forth in

Note 15 Variable Interest Entities

on pages


through


of

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

. In connection with the 2006 International Paper installment sale of forestlands, we received $4.8 billion of installment notes. These installment notes were used by variable interest entities as collateral for borrowings from third-party lenders.  These variable interest entities were restructured in 2015 when the installment notes and third-party loans were extended. The restructured variable interest entities hold installment notes of $4.8 billion that mature in August 2021 (unless extended) and third-party loans of $4.2 billion that mature in the fourth quarter of 2020 (unless extended). These third-party loans are shown in Current nonrecourse financial liabilities of variable interest entities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. We are evaluating alternatives for extending the installment notes and refinancing the third-party loans.

Failure to extend, renew or refinance these third-party loans prior to their stated maturity, which we believe is unlikely, could necessitate a disposition of the installment notes to facilitate the $4.2 billion debt payment, which we are confident could be achieved.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OUTLOOK FOR


Capital Expenditures and Long-Term Debt

International Paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures, service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements during


with current cash balances and cash from operations. Additionally, the Company has existing credit facilities totaling

$2.1 billion

at

December 31, 2019

.

The Company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows. Funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives. The primary goals of the Company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense. The majority of International Paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors. The Company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at

December 31, 2019

, and was well below the thresholds stipulated under the covenants as defined in our credit agreements.

Maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of International Paper’s financing strategy. At

December 31, 2019

, the Company held long-term credit ratings of BBB (stable outlook) and Baa2 (stable outlook) by S&P and Moody’s, respectively.

Contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at

December 31, 2019

, were as follows:

(a)

Includes

$1.3 billion

relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the 2006 Transformation Plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of Weyerhaeuser Company’s Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business. Also includes

$1.1 billion

relating to fiber supply agreements assumed in conjunction with the 2016 acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business.

(b)

Not included in the above table due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $153 million. Also not included in the above table is $128 million of Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which will be settled from 2020 - 2026.

We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2019

, to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have



been provided thereon (see

Note 13 Income Taxes

on pages


through


of I

tem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

). We do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.

Pension Obligations and Funding

At

December 31, 2019

, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s U.S. defined benefit plans determined under U.S. GAAP was approximately

$1.5 billion

higher than the fair value of plan assets, excluding non-U.S. plans. Approximately $1.2 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements. Under current IRS funding rules, the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits (the projected benefit obligation) for accounting purposes. In December 2008, the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 (WERA) was passed by the U.S. Congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections. Funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the Company, and the timing of its implementation, as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions elected not to make any voluntary contributions in 2018 or 2019. At this time, we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in


, although the Company may elect to make future voluntary contributions. The timing and amount of future contributions, which could be material, will depend on a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America to purchase a group annuity contract and transfer approximately

$1.6 billion

of International Paper's U.S. qualified pension plan projected benefit obligations, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction closed on October 2, 2018 and was funded with pension plan assets. Under the transaction, at the end of 2018, Prudential assumed responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately

23,000

retirees or their beneficiaries receiving less than

$1,000

in monthly benefit payments from the plan. Settlement accounting rules required a remeasurement of the qualified plan as of October 2, 2018 and the Company recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of

$424 million

before tax in the fourth quarter of 2018.

ILIM SHAREHOLDER'S AGREEMENT

In October 2007, in connection with the formation of the Ilim joint venture, International Paper entered into a shareholder’s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners. This agreement provides that at any time, either the Company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock agreement. If these or any other deadlock procedures under the shareholder's agreement are commenced, although it is not obligated to do so, the Company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners'

50%

interest in Ilim. Any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by Russian and other relevant anti-trust authorities. Based on the provisions of the agreement, the Company estimates that the current purchase price for its partners' 50% interests would be approximately $1.6 billion, which could be satisfied by payment of cash or International Paper common stock, or some combination of the two, at the Company's option. The purchase by the Company of its partners’ 50% interest in Ilim would result in the consolidation of Ilim's financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods. The parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions of the shareholder’s agreement.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires International Paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these estimates require subjective judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of International Paper, and that can require judgments by management that affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and income taxes. The Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors and with its independent registered public accounting firm.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Accruals for contingent liabilities, including personal injury, product liability, environmental and other legal matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount



of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical litigation and settlement experience and recommendations of legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs. The Company utilizes its in-house legal and environmental experts to develop estimates of its legal and environmental obligations, supplemented as needed by third-party specialists to analyze its most complex contingent liabilities.

We calculate our workers' compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors. The workers' compensation reserves are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the ultimate settlement of workers' compensation reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL

An impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows from future operations or disposals. A goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. Assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. Additionally, evaluation for possible impairment of goodwill is required annually. The amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments may require the estimation of future cash flows or the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, various other projected operating economic factors and other intended uses of the assets. As these key factors change in future periods, the Company will update its impairment analysis to reflect its latest estimates and projections.

ASU 2011-08, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other," allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If a qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test unless the entity determines that, based on that qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value.

The Company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by applying the qualitative assessment to its North America Industrial Packaging, European Papers, Russian Papers, and Brazilian Papers reporting units and the quantitative goodwill impairment test to its Global Cellulose Fibers and EMEA Industrial Packaging reporting units as of October 1, 2019. For this evaluation, the Company assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units under the qualitative assessment for the reporting units listed above and the result of the qualitative assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its North America Industrial Packaging, European Papers, Russian Papers, and Brazilian Papers reporting units were less than their  carrying values.

The Company also performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test which included comparing the carrying amount of the Global Cellulose Fibers and EMEA Industrial Packaging reporting units to their estimated fair value. The Company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for Global Cellulose Fibers due to the reporting unit's outlook and for EMEA Industrial Packaging due to the changes in the reporting unit's asset base as a result of strategic capital projects and acquisitions since the previous quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company calculated the estimated

fair value of its Global Cellulose Fibers and EMEA Industrial Packaging reporting units using a probability-weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples and transaction multiples. The carrying amount did not exceed the estimated fair value of the EMEA  Industrial Packaging reporting unit. The carrying amount did exceed the estimated fair value of the Global Cellulose Fibers reporting unit, and it was  determined that all of the goodwill in the reporting unit, totaling $52 million, was impaired. This impairment charge was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2019. The decline in the fair value of Global Cellulose Fibers and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the outlook of the Global Cellulose Fibers reporting unit's operations.

In addition, the Company considered whether there were any events or circumstances outside of the annual evaluation that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate a goodwill impairment evaluation. In consideration of all relevant factors, there were no indicators that would require goodwill impairment subsequent to October 1, 2019.

No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2018.

During 2018, a determination was made that the current carrying value of the long-lived assets of the Brazil Packaging business exceeded their estimated fair value



due to a change in the outlook for the business. Management engaged a third party to assist with determining the fair value of the business and the fixed assets. The fair value of the business was calculated using a probability-weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples, and transaction multiples and the fair value of the fixed assets was determined using a market approach. As a result, a pre-tax charge of $122 million ($81 million, net of tax) was recorded related to the impairment of an intangible asset and fixed assets.

PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

The charges recorded for pension benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with International Paper’s consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases and mortality rates.

The calculations of pension obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities.

Benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of

December 31, 2019

, for International Paper’s pension plan were as follows:

The table below shows assumptions used by  International Paper to calculate U.S. pension obligations for the years shown:

International Paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on December 31 of each year or more frequently if required, to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio. The discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.

The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended

December 31, 2019

was

7.25%

.

Increasing (decreasing) the expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets by an additional

0.25

% would decrease (increase)


pension expense by approximately

$24 million

, while a (decrease) increase of

0.25

% in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately

$31 million

.

Actual rates of return earned on U.S. pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were:

The 2012, 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of International Paper and Temple-Inland asset returns. International Paper and Temple-Inland assets were combined in October 2014. The annualized time-weighted rate of return earned on U.S. pension plan assets was

9.2%

and

9.8%

for the past five and ten years, respectively.

ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. These net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years.

Net periodic pension plan expenses, calculated for all of International Paper’s plans, were as follows:

The decrease in 2019 pension expense primarily reflects lower service cost due to the salaried pension freeze, lower amortization and the absence of a settlement loss in the current year slightly offset by lower asset returns.



Assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of December 31,


, projected future net periodic pension plan expenses would be as follows:

The Company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately

$46 million

for its U.S. defined benefit plans in


, compared to expense of

$93 million

in


.  The estimated decrease in net pension expense in 2020 is primarily due to higher return on assets and lower interest cost partially offset by higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service cost.

The market value of plan assets for International Paper’s U.S. qualified pension plan at

December 31, 2019

totaled approximately

$10.2 billion

, consisting of approximately

37%

equity securities,

50%

debt securities,

8%

real estate funds and

5%

other assets.

The Company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the Company, and other factors. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future. There were no required contributions to the U.S. qualified plan in 2019. The nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments, which totaled

$26 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.

INCOME TAXES

International Paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Where the Company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the Company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. Changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change in tax laws, or recent court cases that are relevant to the matter.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit

will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies.

While International Paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.

EFFECT OF INFLATION

While inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as energy, wood fiber and chemical costs, have an impact on the Company’s operating results, changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years. Sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS

International Paper has operations in a number of countries. Its operations in those countries also export to, and compete with, imports from other regions. As such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s financial statements. Direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities. Indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the United States (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). In general, a weaker U.S. dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to International Paper. The currencies that have the most impact are the Euro, the Brazilian real, the Polish zloty and the Russian ruble.



MARKET RISK

We use financial instruments, including fixed and variable rate debt, to finance operations, for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, financial instruments, including various derivative contracts, are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and foreign currency risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. Information related to International Paper’s debt obligations is included in

Note 16 Debt and Lines of Credit

on pages


and


of

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

. A discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in

Note 17 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

of

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

.

The fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments. We assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and currency rates and commodity prices.

INTEREST RATE RISK

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short- and long-term debt obligations and investments in marketable securities. We invest in investment-grade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AAA and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund. Our investments in marketable securities at

December 31, 2019

and


are stated at cost, which approximates market due to their short-term nature. Our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material.

We issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions. Derivative instruments, such as, interest rate swaps, may be used to execute this strategy. At

December 31, 2019

and


, the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately

$9.8 billion

and

$9.2 billion

, respectively. The potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately

$511 million

and

$538 million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

The objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. Commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

International Paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and

operated in foreign countries. Our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our after-tax cash flows. We address these risks on a limited basis by entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps, or foreign exchange contracts. At

December 31, 2019

and


, the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a

$16 million

asset and an

$8 million

liability, respectively.

The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately

$87 million

and

$29 million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON:

Financial Statements

The management of International Paper Company is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America considered appropriate in the circumstances to present fairly the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows on a consistent basis. Management has also prepared the other information in this annual report and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

As can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment, some financial statement amounts are based on estimates and judgments. Even though estimates and judgments are used, measures have been taken to provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial information contained in this annual report. We have formed a Disclosure Committee to oversee this process.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm Deloitte & Touche LLP. During its audits, Deloitte & Touche LLP was given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of stockholders and the board of directors and all committees of the board. Management believes that all representations made to the independent auditors during their audits were valid and appropriate.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of International Paper Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules (13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes. All internal control systems have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control objectives. The Company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures, contains self-

monitoring mechanisms, and is audited by the internal audit function. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified. Our procedures for financial reporting include the active involvement of senior management, our Audit and Finance Committee and our staff of highly qualified financial and legal professionals.

The Company has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

. In making this assessment, it used the criteria described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of

December 31, 2019

, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The Company completed the acquisitions of four packaging businesses located in Portugal (Ovar), France (Torigni and Cabourg), and Spain (Tavernes de la Valldigna and Montblanc) over the course of 2019. Due to the timing of these acquisitions, we have excluded these businesses from our evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. For the period ended December 31, 2019, sales and assets for these businesses represented approximately 0.4% of net sales and 0.6% of total assets.

Internal Control Environment And Board Of Directors Oversight

Our internal control environment includes an enterprise-wide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top.” This is exemplified by our ethics program that includes long-standing principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of International Paper business, which have been distributed to all employees; a toll-free telephone helpline whereby any employee may anonymously report suspected violations of law or International Paper’s policy; and an office of ethics and business practice. The internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel, appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility, dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout International Paper, and an extensive program of internal audits with management follow-up.



The Board of Directors, assisted by the Audit and Finance Committee (Committee), monitors the integrity of the Company’s financial statements and financial reporting procedures, the performance of the Company’s internal audit function and independent auditors, and other matters set forth in its charter. The Committee, which consists of independent directors, meets regularly with representatives of management, and with the independent auditors and the Internal Auditor, with and without management representatives in attendance, to review their activities. The Committee’s Charter takes into account the New York Stock Exchange rules relating to Audit Committees and the SEC rules and regulations promulgated as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, including critical accounting policies and significant management judgments, with management and the independent auditors. The Committee’s report recommending the inclusion of such financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will be set forth in our Proxy Statement.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of International Paper Company:

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of International Paper Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 19, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,

evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Income Taxes - Valuation Allowances - Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized based on estimates of future taxable income.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $203 million related to indefinite-lived non-US net operating loss carryforwards. Management’s determination that a valuation allowance was necessary in the current year was influenced by current year changes in global tax laws, which have adversely impacted the time period over which the Company could reasonably realize the deferred tax asset based on its current global structure and ability to execute prudent and feasible tax planning actions.

We identified the valuation allowance as a critical audit matter because it is dependent upon an analysis of complex tax laws and subjective projections of future taxable income. As a result, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's projections and the timing for recognition of the valuation allowance, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists.



How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to estimated future taxable income and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation allowance assessment for income taxes, including management’s controls over the identification and evaluation of changes in global tax laws, estimates of future taxable income, and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized.

•

With the assistance of our income tax specialists:

•

We identified and evaluated changes in global tax laws and the potential impact on the Company’s ability to utilize the deferred tax asset.

•

We considered management’s intent and ability to execute prudent and feasible tax planning actions based upon their underlying economic substance and local tax laws.

•

We evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate future taxable income by comparing actual results to management’s historical estimates.

•

We considered whether management’s determination that a valuation allowance was required in the current year was indicative of management bias by evaluating the Company’s historical conclusions reached with respect to the realizability of its deferred tax assets in other jurisdictions with unlimited carryforward periods.

Other Accrued Liabilities - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities - Harris County San Jacinto Environmental Proceeding - Refer to Note 14 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company has obligations related to certain environmental matters. Such obligations are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated.

The Company has been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) at the Harris County San Jacinto Waste Pits Superfund Site (“San Jacinto”). The Company has been participating in the remediation activities at the site with other PRPs.

During 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a Record of Decision (“ROD”) which included a waste removal and relocation remedy for the site, including an estimate of costs to remediate. Due to uncertainty about the technological feasibility of executing the remedy prescribed within the ROD, the Company believes additional losses for this site are not estimable.

We identified the San Jacinto environmental proceeding as a critical audit matter because of the uncertainty associated with executing the remedy prescribed in the ROD. As a result, auditing management's determination that additional losses for the site are not reasonably estimable required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our environmental specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to management’s determination and the Company’s disclosure that additional losses are not estimable related to San Jacinto included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls related to San Jacinto, including management’s controls over evaluating whether the liability was reflective of current circumstances, included necessary costs (i.e. probable and estimable), and the related disclosure in the financial statements was accurate and complete.

•

With assistance from our environmental specialists:

•

We inquired of the Company’s environmental specialists, including inquiries of both internal and external legal counsel, to understand the status of progress under the 2018 Administrative Order on Consent (“AOC”) as well as the status of ongoing discussions with the EPA and the other regulatory agencies involved.

•

We inspected correspondence between the PRPs and the EPA to gain an understanding of progress and developments related to the site based on the timeline and requirements outlined in the AOC, including consideration of contradictory evidence or indications of Management bias.

•

We assessed management’s assertion regarding the technical feasibility of compliance with the ROD in evaluating the recorded liability.



•

We evaluated the sufficiency of the Company’s disclosures related to additional losses not being reasonably estimable.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of International Paper Company:

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of International Paper Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company, and our report dated February 19, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

As described in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting the acquisitions of packaging businesses located in Portugal (Ovar), France (Torigni and Cabourg), and Spain (Tavernes de la Valldigna and Montblanc) completed during 2019. The acquired businesses constitute 0.4% of net sales and 0.6% of total assets of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at these acquired businesses.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF BUSINESS

International Paper (the Company) is a global paper and packaging company with primary markets and manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, North Africa and Russia. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to available industry capacity and general economic conditions.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require the use of management’s estimates. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates.

On January 1, 2018, the Company completed the previously announced transfer of its North American Consumer Packaging business and received a

20.5

%

ownership interest in a subsidiary of Graphic Packaging Holding Company that holds the assets of the combined business. See

Note 8

for further details.

CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International Paper and subsidiaries for which we have a controlling financial interest, including variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

The equity method of accounting is applied for investments when the Company has significant influence over the investee’s operations, or when the investee is structured with separate capital accounts and our investment is considered more than minor. Our material equity method investments are described in

Note 11

.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

The Company allocates the total consideration of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the business combination date. In developing estimates of fair values for long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, the Company utilizes a variety of inputs including forecasted cash flows, anticipated growth rates, discount rates, estimated replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence factors. Determining the fair value for

specifically identified intangible assets such as customer lists and developed technology involves judgment. We may refine our estimates and make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed over a measurement period, not to exceed one year. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of asset acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are charged to the consolidated statement of earnings. Subsequent actual results of the underlying business activity supporting the specifically identified intangible assets could change, requiring us to record impairment charges or adjust their economic lives in future periods. See

Note 7

for further details.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

A discontinued operation may include a component or a group of components of the Company's operations. A disposal of a component or a group of components is reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results when the following occurs: (1) a component (or group of components) meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale; (2) the component or group of components is disposed of by sale; or (3) the component or group of components is disposed of other than by sale (for example, by abandonment or in a distribution to owners in a spinoff).

For any component classified as held for sale or disposed of by sale or other than by sale, qualifying for presentation as a discontinued operation, the Company reports the results of operations of the discontinued operations (including any gain or loss recognized on the disposal or loss recognized on classification as held for sale of a discontinued operation), less applicable income taxes (benefit), as a separate component in the consolidated statement of operations for current and all prior periods presented. See

Note 8

for further details.

RESTRUCTURING     LIABILITIES AND COSTS

For operations to be closed or restructured, a liability and related expense is recorded in the period when operations cease. For termination costs associated with employees covered by a written or substantive plan, a liability is recorded when it is probable that employees will be entitled to benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For termination costs associated with employees not covered by a written and broadly communicated policy covering involuntary termination benefits (severance plan), a liability is recorded for costs to terminate employees (one-time termination benefits) when the termination plan has been approved and committed to by management, the employees to be terminated have been identified, the termination plan benefit terms are communicated, the employees identified in the plan have been notified and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely



that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The timing and amount of an accrual is dependent upon the type of benefits granted, the timing of communication and other provisions that may be provided in the benefit plan. The accounting for each termination is evaluated individually. See

Note 6

for further details.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Generally, the Company recognizes revenue on a point-in-time basis when the customer takes title to the goods and assumes the risks and rewards for the goods. For customized goods where the Company has a legally enforceable right to payment for the goods, the Company recognizes revenue over time, which generally is, as the goods are produced.

The Company’s revenue is primarily derived from fixed consideration; however, we do have contract terms that give rise to variable consideration, primarily cash discounts and volume rebates. International Paper offers early payment discounts to customers across the Company’s businesses. The Company estimates the expected cash discounts and other customer refunds based on the historical experience across the Company’s portfolio of customers to record reductions in revenue which is consistent with the most likely amount method outlined in ASC 606. Management has concluded that this method is the best estimate of the consideration the Company will be entitled to from its customers.

The Company has elected to present all sales taxes on a net basis, account for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities, recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset the Company would recognize is one year or less, and not record interest income or interest expense when the difference in timing of control or transfer and customer payment is one year or less. See

Note 3

for further details.

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS

Temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less and money market funds with greater than three month maturities but with the right to redeem without notice are treated as cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which approximates market value. See

Note 9

for further details.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. In the United States, costs of raw materials and finished pulp and paper products, are generally determined using the last-in, first-out method.

Other inventories are valued using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods. See

Note 9

for further details.

LEASED ASSETS

Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company's leases may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options to extend are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Some leases have variable payments, however, because they are not based on an index or rate, they are not included in the ROU assets and liabilities. Variable payments for real estate leases primarily related to common area maintenance, insurance, taxes and utilities. Variable payments for equipment, vehicles, and leases within supply agreements primarily related to usage, repairs and maintenance. As the implicit rate is not readily determinable for most of the Company's leases, the Company applies a portfolio approach using an estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the initial present value of lease payments over the lease terms on a collateralized basis over a similar term, which is based on market and company specific information. We use the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjust that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, and apply the rate based on the currency of the lease, which is updated on a quarterly basis for measurement of new lease liabilities. Leases having a lease term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In addition, the Company has applied the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all of the Company's leases. See

Note 10

for further details.

PLANTS, PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT

Plants, properties and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for betterments are capitalized, whereas normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The units-of-production method of depreciation is used for pulp and paper mills, and the straight-line method is used for other plants and equipment. See

Note 9

for further details.

GOODWILL

Annual evaluation for possible goodwill impairment is performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, with additional interim evaluation performed when management believes that it is more likely than not, that events or circumstances have occurred that would result in the impairment of a reporting unit’s goodwill.

The Company has the option to evaluate goodwill for impairment by first performing a qualitative   assessment of events and circumstances to determine whether it is



more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amounts, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not required to be performed. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company does not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, the Company is required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. In performing this evaluation, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using a probability-weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples and transaction multiples. Key assumptions in the quantitative goodwill impairment test considered by management include the discount rate, long-term growth rate, tax rate, inflation rate, and business forecast. For reporting units whose carrying amount is in excess of their estimated fair value, the reporting unit will record an impairment charge by the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. See

Note 12

for further discussion.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. A recoverability test is performed based on undiscounted cash flows, requiring judgments as to whether assets are held and used or held for sale, the weighting of operational alternatives being considered by management and estimates of the amount and timing of expected future cash flows from the use of the long-lived assets generated by their use. Impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value. See

Note 8

for further discussion.

INCOME TAXES

International Paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate changes are enacted.

International Paper records its worldwide tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Where the Company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns.

Where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the Company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and the facts of each matter. Changes to recorded liabilities are made only when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, a change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter.

While the judgments and estimates made by the Company are based on management’s evaluation of the technical merits of a matter, assisted as necessary by consultation with outside consultants, historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts, resulting in adjustments that could materially affect future financial statements. See

Note 13

for further details.

International Paper uses the flow-through method to account for investment tax credits earned on eligible open-loop biomass facilities and combined heat and power system expenditures. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense in the year they are earned rather than a reduction in the asset basis.

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS

Costs associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value when the amount and timing of expected cash payments are reliably determinable. See

Note 14

for further details.

TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Balance sheets of international operations are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, while statements of operations are translated at average rates. Adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as cumulative translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

NOTE 2 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Other than as described below, no new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.



RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Intangibles

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment." This guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2 of the previous goodwill impairment test approach to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting   unit's carrying amount over its fair value. This guidance should be applied prospectively. The Company early adopted the provision of this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2019 in conjunction with our annual evaluation for possible goodwill impairment which resulted in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge of

$


million

for the Global Cellulose Fibers reporting unit. See

Note 12

.

Pension Plan Disclosures

In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09, "Codification Improvements," which included amendments to Subtopic 962-325. This disclosure guidance pertains to the presentation of certain types of investments

. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2019 in conjunction with the preparation of our 2019 annual Form 10-K disclosures and presentation related to pension plan assets.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842): Leases." The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance effective January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective optional transition method. Therefore, the standard was applied beginning January 1, 2019, and prior periods were not restated. The adoption of the standard did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of Retained earnings. The Company elected the package of practical expedients and implemented internal controls and system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information upon adoption.

The adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of a right of use asset and short-term and long-term liabilities recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet related to operating leases. Accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged. In addition, the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. See

Note 10

.

Comprehensive Income

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income." This guidance provided entities the option to reclassify stranded tax effects caused by the newly-enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. As a result, the Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2019, and recorded a net increase to opening Retained earnings and a decrease to opening Accumulated other comprehensive income of

$


million

, due to the cumulative impact of adopting the new guidance.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED

Income Taxes

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes." This guidance removes certain exceptions from recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. It also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for tax goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those years.  Early adoption of the amendments is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance.

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." This guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment method with a method that reflects expected credit losses. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has substantially completed its evaluation of the provisions of this guidance and determined it will not have a material impact on the consolidated statement of position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company will adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective approach on its



effective date of January 1, 2020. As a result of using this approach, the Company will recognize the

cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for initial application of the guidance.

NOTE 3 - REVENUE RECOGNITION

DISAGGREGATED REVENUE

A geographic disaggregation of revenues across our company segmentation in the following tables provides information to assist in evaluating the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows and how they may be impacted by economic factors.

(a)

Net sales are attributed to countries based on the location of the reportable segment making the sale.



(a)

Net sales are attributed to countries based on the location of the reportable segment making the sale.

REVENUE CONTRACT BALANCES

The opening and closing balances of the Company's contract assets and current contract liabilities are as follows:

A contract asset is created when the Company recognizes revenue on its customized products prior to having an unconditional right to payment from the customer, which generally does not occur until title and risk of loss passes to the customer.

A contract liability is created when customers prepay for goods prior to the Company transferring those goods to the customer. The contract liability is reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The

majority of our customer prepayments are received during the fourth quarter each year for goods that will

be transferred to customers over the following twelve months.

The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company's contract assets and contract liabilities primarily results from the difference between

the price and quantity at comparable points in time for goods which we have an unconditional right to payment or receive pre-payment from the customer, respectively.

PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS

International Paper's principal business is to manufacture and sell fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper goods. As a general rule, none of our businesses provide equipment installation or other ancillary services outside of producing and shipping packaging, pulp and paper goods to customers.

The nature of the Company's contracts can vary based on the business, customer type and region; however, in all instances it is International Paper's customary business practice to receive a valid order from the



customer, in which each parties' rights and related payment terms are clearly identifiable.

Contracts or purchase orders with customers could include a single type of product or it could include multiple types/grades of products. Regardless, the contracted price with the customer is agreed to at the individual product level outlined in the customer contracts or purchase orders. The Company does not

bundle prices; however, we do negotiate with customers

on pricing and rebates for the same products based on a variety of factors (e.g. level of contractual volume, geographical location, etc.). Management has concluded that the prices negotiated with each individual customer are representative of the stand-alone selling price of the product.

NOTE 4 EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of common

shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed assuming that all potentially dilutive securities were converted into common shares.

There are no adjustments required to be made to net income for purposes of computing basic and diluted EPS.

A reconciliation of the amounts included in the computation of basic earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, and diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations is as follows:

The following table summarizes the final fair value assigned to assets and liabilities acquired as of June 30, 2017:

NOTE 8 DIVESTITURES AND IMPAIRMENTS OF BUSINESSES

2019:

On October 30, 2019, the Company closed the previously announced sale of its controlling interest in International Paper APPM Limited (APPM) to West Coast Paper Mills Limited (WCPM). The net proceeds received for the sale totaled

$


million

. International Paper remains a passive investor retaining a


%

interest in APPM until such time that IP sells its remaining shares. The Company will account for its retained investment at fair value.



As a result of the transaction, a net pre-tax impairment charge of

$


million

(

$


million

after taxes) was recorded during 2019. This charge included

$


million

related to a loss for the write-off of  the cumulative foreign currency translation of APPM and a

$


million

loss related to the write-off of the long-lived assets of APPM. This charge is included in the Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and is included in the results for the Printing Papers segment. A loss of

$


million

(before and after taxes) has been allocated to the noncontrolling interest related to the impairment of the long-lived assets of APPM. The fair value of the Company's retained investment in APPM was

$


million

at December 31, 2019.

2018:

During 2018, a determination was made that the current carrying value of the long-lived assets of the Brazil Packaging business exceeded their estimated fair value due to a change in the outlook for the business. Management engaged a third party to assist with determining the fair value of the business and the fixed assets. The fair value of the business was calculated using a probability-weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples, and transaction multiples and the fair value of the fixed assets was determined using a market approach. As a result, a pre-tax charge of

$


million

(

$


million

, net of tax) was recorded related to the impairment of an intangible asset and fixed assets. This charge is included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and is included in the results for the Industrial Packaging segment. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company announced that it was exploring strategic options for its Brazil Packaging business.

2017:

On September 7, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its foodservice business in China to Huhtamaki Hong Kong Limited. Proceeds received totaled approximately RMB


million

(

$


million

using the September 30, 2017 exchange rate). Under the terms of the transaction, and after post-closing adjustments, International Paper received approximately RMB


million

in exchange for its ownership interest in

two

China foodservice entities and RMB


million

for the sale of notes receivable from the acquired entities.

Subsequent to the announced agreement in June 2017, a determination was made that the current book value of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value of

$


million

, which was the agreed upon selling price. As a result, a pre-tax charge of

$


million

was recorded during the second quarter of 2017, to write down the long-lived assets of this business to their estimated fair value. Amounts related to this business included in the Company's statement of operations were immaterial for all periods presented.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

2017:

On January 1, 2018, the Company completed the transfer of its North American Consumer Packaging business, which included its North American Coated Paperboard and Foodservice businesses, to Graphic Packaging International Partners, LLC (GPIP), a subsidiary of Graphic Packaging Holding Company,  in exchange for a

20.5

%

ownership interest in GPIP. GPIP subsequently transferred the North American Consumer Packaging business to Graphic Packaging International, LLC (GPI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GPIP. International Paper is accounting for its ownership interest in the combined business under the equity method. The Company determined the fair value of its investment in the combined business to be

$

1.1

billion

and recorded a pre-tax gain of

$


million

(

$


million

, net of tax) in 2018. The fair value was calculated using a market approach using inputs classified as Level 2 and Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in

The Company accounts for the following investments under the equity method of accounting.

GRAPHIC PACKAGING INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS, LLC

On January 1, 2018, the Company completed the transfer of its North American Consumer Packaging business, which includes its North American Coated Paperboard and Foodservice businesses, to Graphic Packaging International Partners, LLC (GPIP), a subsidiary of Graphic Packaging Holding Company, in exchange for a

20.5

%

ownership interest in GPIP. GPIP subsequently transferred the North American Consumer Packaging business to Graphic Packaging International, LLC (GPI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GPIP that holds the assets of the combined business. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's ownership percentage in GPIP was

21.6

%

. The Company recorded equity earnings, net of taxes, of

$


million

for each of the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


. The Company received cash dividends from GPIP of

$


million

and

$


million

in


and


, respectively. At both

December 31, 2019

billion

, which was

$


million

and

$


million

more than the Company's proportionate share of the entity's underlying net assets at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. The difference primarily relates to the basis difference between the fair value of our investment and the underlying net assets and is generally amortized in equity earnings over a period consistent with the underlying long-lived assets.



Management engaged a third party to assist with determining the fair value of the intangible assets and the fixed assets. The fair value of the intangible assets were calculated using income and market approaches and the fair value of the fixed assets was calculated using a cost approach. The fair values were determined using inputs classified as Level 2 and Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in

Note 17

. The Company is party to various agreements with GPI under which it sells fiber and other products to GPI. Sales under these agreements were

$


million

NOTE 12 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

GOODWILL

The following table presents changes in the goodwill balances as allocated to each business segment for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


:

(a)

Represents the effects of foreign currency translations and reclassifications.

(b)

Reflects a reduction from tax benefits generated by the deduction of goodwill amortization for tax purposes in the U.S.

(c)

Reflects the goodwill for the acquisitions of Industrial Packaging box plants in EMEA of which

$


million

is considered provisional.

(d)

Reflects the reclassification of India goodwill and related impairment losses to held for sale prior to the sale of the business.

(e)

Reflects the impairment of the Global Cellulose Fibers reporting unit.

The Company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by applying the qualitative assessment to its North America Industrial Packaging, European Papers, Russian Papers, and Brazilian Papers reporting units and the quantitative goodwill impairment test to its Global Cellulose Fibers and EMEA Industrial Packaging reporting units as of October 1, 2019. For the current year evaluation, the Company assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units under the qualitative assessment for the reporting units listed above and the results of the qualitative assessments indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its North America Industrial Packaging, European Papers, Russian Papers, and Brazilian Papers reporting units were less than their  carrying values.

The company also performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test which included comparing the carrying amount of the Global Cellulose Fibers and EMEA Industrial Packaging reporting units to their estimated fair value. The Company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for Global Cellulose Fibers due to the reporting unit's outlook and for EMEA Industrial Packaging due to the changes in the reporting unit's asset

base as a result of strategic capital projects and acquisitions since the previous quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company calculated the estimated fair value of its Global Cellulose Fibers and EMEA Industrial Packaging reporting units using a probability-weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples and transaction multiples. The carrying amount did not exceed the estimated fair value of the EMEA  Industrial Packaging reporting unit. The carrying amount did exceed the estimated fair value of the Global Cellulose Fibers reporting unit, and it was determined that all of the goodwill in the reporting unit, totaling

$


million

, was impaired. This charge is included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The decline in the fair value of Global Cellulose Fibers and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the outlook of the Global Cellulose Fibers reporting unit's operations.

In addition, the Company considered whether there were any events or circumstances outside of the annual evaluation that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate a goodwill impairment evaluation. In consideration of all relevant factors, there were no indicators that would



require goodwill impairment subsequent to October 1, 2019.

OTHER INTANGIBLES

Identifiable intangible assets comprised the following:

The Company recognized the following amounts as amortization expense related to intangible assets:

Based on current intangibles subject to amortization, estimated amortization expense for each of the succeeding years is as follows:

NOTE 13 INCOME TAXES

The components of International Paper’s earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings by taxing jurisdiction were as follows:

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from


%

to


%

; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time deemed repatriation

transition tax (the Transition Tax) on certain earnings of

foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; (5) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how AMT

credits can be realized; (6) capital expensing; (7) eliminating the deduction on U.S. manufacturing activities; and (8) creating new limitations on

deductible interest expense and executive compensation.

In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we recorded a provisional net tax benefit of

$

1.22

billion

in the period ending December 31, 2017. The net tax benefit primarily consisted of a net tax benefit for the re-measurement of U.S. deferred taxes of

$

1.454

billion

and an expense for the Transition Tax of

$


million

. During the period ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an additional net tax benefit of

$


million

associated with the one-time effects of the Tax Act.



The provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations (excluding noncontrolling interests) by taxing jurisdiction was as follows:

The Company’s deferred income tax provision (benefit) includes a

$


million

benefit, a

$


million

benefit and a

$

1.459

billion

benefit for


,


and


, respectively, for the effect of various changes in non-U.S. and U.S. federal and state tax rates.

International Paper made income tax payments, net of refunds, of

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

in


,


and


, respectively.

A reconciliation of income tax expense using the statutory U.S. income tax rate compared with the actual income tax provision follows:



The tax effects of significant temporary differences, representing deferred income tax assets and liabilities at

December 31, 2019

and


, were as follows:

(a)   The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was an increase of

$


million

and an increase of

$


million

, respectively. The net change in the current year is primarily due to tax law changes in foreign jurisdictions impacting future utilization of deferred tax assets of

$


million

.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under the captions Deferred charges and other assets and Deferred income taxes. Of the

$

1.4

billion

of deferred tax liabilities for forestlands, related installment sales, and investment in subsidiary,

$


million

is attributable to an investment in subsidiary and relates to a 2006 International Paper installment sale of forestlands and

$


million

is attributable to a 2007 Temple-Inland installment sale of forestlands (see

Note 15

).

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


is as follows:

If the Company were to prevail on the unrecognized tax benefits recorded, substantially all of the balances at

December 31, 2019

,


and


would benefit the effective tax rate.

The Company accrues interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The Company had approximately

$


million

accrued for the payment of estimated interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits at both

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

The major jurisdictions where the Company files income tax returns are the United States, Brazil, France, Poland and Russia. Generally, tax years 2006 through 2018 remain open and subject to examination by the relevant

tax authorities. The Company frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due. These

challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing, nature, and amount of deductions

and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Pending audit settlements and the expiration of statute of limitations could reduce the uncertain tax positions by

$


million

during the next twelve months.



The Brazilian Federal Revenue Service has challenged the deductibility of goodwill amortization generated in a 2007 acquisition by International Paper do Brasil Ltda., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company received assessments for the tax years 2007-2015 totaling approximately

$


million

in tax, and

$


million

in interest and penalties as of December 31, 2019 (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates). After a previous favorable ruling challenging the basis for these assessments, we received unfavorable decisions in October 2018 and November 2019 from the Brazilian Administrative Council of Tax Appeals. The Company has appealed and intends to further appeal these and any future unfavorable administrative judgments to the Brazilian federal courts; however, this tax litigation matter may take many years to resolve. The Company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transaction underlying these assessments, and has concluded based on Brazilian tax law, that its tax position would be sustained. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for tax years subsequent to 2015.

The Company provides for foreign withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. state income taxes on earnings intended to be repatriated from non-U.S. subsidiaries, which we believe will be limited in the future to each year's current earnings. No provision for these taxes on approximately

$

2.2

billion

of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 has been made, as these earnings are considered indefinitely invested. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted in a taxable manner is not practicable.

If management decided to monetize the Company’s foreign investments, we would recognize the tax cost related to the excess of the book value over the tax basis of those investments. This would include foreign withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. Federal and state income taxes. Determination of the tax cost that that would be incurred upon monetization of the Company’s foreign investments is not practicable; however, we do not believe it would be material.

The following details the scheduled expiration dates of the Company’s net operating loss and income tax credit carryforwards:

(a)

State amounts are presented net of federal benefit.

NOTE 14 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

GUARANTEES

In connection with sales of businesses, property, equipment, forestlands and other assets, International Paper commonly makes representations and warranties relating to such businesses or assets, and may agree to indemnify buyers with respect to tax and environmental liabilities, breaches of representations and warranties, and other matters. Where liabilities for such matters are determined to be probable and reasonably estimable, accrued liabilities are recorded at the time of sale as a cost of the transaction.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Environmental

International Paper has been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Many of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received



waste from many different sources. While joint and several liability is authorized under CERCLA and equivalent state laws, as a practical matter, liability for CERCLA cleanups is typically allocated among the many PRPs.  There are other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the Company’s current, closed or formerly-owned facilities, and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet.

Remediation costs are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become probable and reasonably estimable. International Paper has estimated the probable liability associated with these environmental remediation matters, including those described herein, to be approximately

$


million

(

$


million

undiscounted) in the aggregate as of

December 31, 2019

. Other than as described below, completion of required environmental remedial actions is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Cass Lake:

One of the matters included above arises out of a closed wood-treating facility located in Cass Lake, Minnesota. In June 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) selected and published a proposed soil remedy at the site, the estimated cost of which is reflected in the overall remediation reserve for the site of

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

. In October 2011, the EPA released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy decision would be delayed. In June 2019, the EPA issued a revised proposed plan concerning clean-up standards at a portion of the site, the estimated cost of which is included within the reserve referenced above. In October 2012, the Natural Resource Trustees for this site provided notice to International Paper and other PRPs of their intent to perform a Natural Resource Damage Assessment. It is premature to predict the outcome of the assessment or to estimate a loss or range of loss, if any, in excess of the liability noted above which may be incurred.

Kalamazoo River:

The Company is a PRP with respect to the Allied Paper, Inc./Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River Superfund Site in Michigan. The EPA asserts that the site is contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) primarily as a result of discharges from various paper mills located along the Kalamazoo River, including a paper mill (the Allied Paper Mill) formerly owned by St. Regis Paper Company (St. Regis). The Company is a successor in interest to St. Regis.

•

Operable Unit 5, Area 1: In March 2016, the Company and other PRPs received a special notice letter from the EPA (i) inviting participation in implementing a remedy for a portion of the site known as Operable Unit 5, Area 1, and (ii) demanding reimbursement of EPA past costs totaling

$


million

, including

$


million

in past costs previously demanded by the

EPA. In December 2016, the EPA issued a unilateral administrative order to the Company and other PRPs to perform the remedy. The Company responded to the unilateral administrative order, agreeing to comply with the order subject to its sufficient cause defenses.

•

Operable Unit 5, Area 2: In September 2017, the EPA issued a Record of Decision selecting the final remedy for a portion of the site known as Operable Unit 5, Area 2, but has not yet issued a special notice letter for implementing the remedy.

•

Operable Unit 1: In October 2016, the Company and another PRP received a special notice letter from the EPA inviting participation in the remedial design component of the landfill remedy for the Allied Paper Mill, which is also known as Operable Unit 1. The Record of Decision establishing the final landfill remedy for the Allied Paper Mill was issued by the EPA in September 2016. In February 2017, the EPA informed the Company that it would make other arrangements for the performance of the remedial design.

As noted below, the Company is involved in allocation/apportionment litigation with regard to the site. In addition, in December 2019, the United States published notice in the Federal Register of a proposed consent decree with NCR Corporation (one of the parties to the allocation/apportionment litigation described below), the State of Michigan and natural resource trustees under which NCR would make payments of more than

$


million

and perform work at the Site at an estimated cost of

$

135.7

million

. The public comment period with respect to the proposed consent decree closes in February 2020.

The Company’s CERCLA liability has not been finally determined with respect to any portions of the site, and except as noted above, the Company has declined to perform any work or reimburse the EPA at this time. Accordingly, it is premature to predict the outcome or estimate our maximum reasonably possible loss or range of loss with respect to this site. We have a recorded liability for future remediation costs at the site that are probable and reasonably estimable, and it remains reasonably possible that additional losses in excess of this recorded liability could be material.

The Company was named as a defendant by Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP, Fort James Corporation and Georgia Pacific LLC in a contribution and cost recovery action for alleged pollution at the site. NCR Corporation and Weyerhaeuser Company are also named as defendants in the suit. The suit seeks contribution under CERCLA for costs purportedly expended by plaintiffs (

$


million

as of the filing of the complaint) and for future remediation costs. In June



2018, the Court issued its Final Judgment and Order, which fixed the past cost amount at approximately

$


million

(plus interest to be determined) and allocated to the Company a


%

share of responsibility for those past costs. The Court did not address responsibility for future costs in its decision. In July 2018, the Company and each of the other parties filed notices appealing the Final Judgment and prior orders incorporated into that Judgment. The proposed consent decree with NCR described above, if entered, would result in the termination of NCR’s involvement in the appeal.

Harris County:

International Paper and McGinnis Industrial Maintenance Corporation (MIMC), a subsidiary of Waste Management, Inc. (WMI), are PRPs at the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund Site in Harris County, Texas. The PRPs have been actively participating in the activities at the site and share the costs of these activities. In September 2016, the EPA issued a proposed remedial action plan (PRAP) for the site, which identified the preferred remedy as the removal of the contaminated material currently protected by an armored cap. In addition, the EPA selected a preferred remedy for the separate southern impoundment that requires offsite disposal. In January 2017, the PRPs submitted comments on the PRAP.

On October 11, 2017, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) selecting the final remedy for the site: removal and relocation of the waste material from both the northern and southern impoundments. The EPA did not specify the methods or practices needed to perform this work. While the EPA’s selected remedy was accompanied by a cost estimate of approximately

$


million

(

$


million

for the northern impoundment

,

and

$


million

for the southern impoundment), we do not believe that estimate provides a reasonable basis for accrual under GAAP because the estimate was based on a technological method for performing the work that we believe is not feasible with respect to the northern impoundment. Subsequent to the issuance of the ROD, there have been numerous meetings between the EPA and the PRPs, and the Company continues to work with the EPA and MIMC/WMI to develop the remedial design.

To this end, in April 2018, the PRPs entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with the EPA, agreeing to work together to develop the remedial design over the subsequent 29 months. The AOC does not include any agreement to perform waste removal or other construction activity at the site. Rather, it involves adaptive management techniques and a pre-design investigation, the objectives of which include filling data gaps (including but not limited to post-Hurricane Harvey technical data generated prior to the ROD and not incorporated into the selected remedy), refining areas and volumes of materials to be addressed, determining

if an excavation remedy is able to be implemented in a manner protective of human health and the environment, and investigating potential impacts of remediation activities to infrastructure in the vicinity. In October 2019, the PRPs received a special notice letter from the EPA (i) inviting participation in implementing the remedy described in the ROD, and (ii) demanding reimbursement of EPA’s past costs, for which we have accrued our portion as of December 31, 2019. In December 2019, the PRPs each responded to the special notice letter. In its response, the Company took the position that the special notice letter was premature and should be withdrawn, given concerns and uncertainties regarding the implementability and constructability of the remedy described in the ROD.

The Company’s response to the special notice letter was consistent with concerns and uncertainties it has raised since the ROD was issued regarding the remedy described in the ROD and regarding the EPA’s estimates for the costs and time required to implement the selected remedy for the northern impoundment. The Company has determined, however, that even if the ROD cannot be implemented, a sheet pile "engineered barrier" can be constructed, which would enhance the existing remedy for the northern impoundment and could also be used should the ROD be determined to be feasible and implementable. In the third quarter of 2018, we increased our recorded liability accordingly to reflect the estimated cost of constructing this barrier. In December 2019, certain pre-design investigation results indicated that dry excavation of the southern impoundment as required by the ROD is feasible, and we increased our recorded liability accordingly to reflect the estimated cost of implementing this remedy for the southern impoundment. Because of ongoing questions regarding cost effectiveness, technical feasibility, timing and other technical data, however, it continues to be uncertain how the ROD will be implemented for the northern impoundment. Consequently, while additional losses in excess of our recorded liability are probable as a result of the selected remedy, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate any further adjustment to our recorded liability or any loss or range of loss in excess of such liability. It remains reasonably possible that additional losses could be material as the remedial design process with the EPA continues over the coming quarters.

International Paper and MIMC/WMI are also defending a lawsuit related to the site brought by approximately


individuals who allege property damage and personal injury. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company resolved a significant number of these plaintiffs’ claims, and we do not believe a material loss is reasonably possible with respect to the remaining plaintiffs’ claims, whether they are settled or litigated to verdict.



Antitrust

Containerboard:

In January 2011, International Paper was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in state court in Cocke County, Tennessee alleging that International Paper violated Tennessee law by conspiring to limit the supply and fix the prices of containerboard from mid-2005 to the present. This lawsuit has been dismissed for failure to prosecute and is no longer pending.

Italy:

In March 2017, the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) commenced an investigation into the Italian packaging industry to determine whether producers of corrugated sheets and boxes violated the applicable European competition law. In April 2019, the ICA concluded its investigation and issued initial findings alleging that over


producers, including our Italian packaging subsidiary (IP Italy), improperly coordinated the production and sale of corrugated sheets and boxes. On August 6, 2019, the ICA issued its decision and assessed IP Italy a fine of

€


million

(approximately

$


million

at current exchange rates) which was recorded in the third quarter of 2019. This charge is included in the Antitrust fines and settlements line item in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. However, we are vigorously appealing this decision of the ICA to the Italian courts and have numerous and strong bases for our appeal.

Contract

Signature:

In August 2014, a lawsuit captioned

Signature Industrial Services LLC et al. v. International Paper Company

was filed in state court in Texas. The

Signature

lawsuit arises out of approximately

$


million

in disputed invoices related to the installation of new equipment at the Company's Orange, Texas mill. In addition to the invoices in dispute,

Signature

and its president allege consequential damages arising from the Company's nonpayment of those invoices. The lawsuit was tried before a jury in Beaumont, Texas, in May 2017. On June 1, 2017, the jury returned a verdict awarding approximately

$


million

in damages to the plaintiffs. The Court issued a judgment on December 14, 2017, awarding the plaintiffs a total of approximately

$


million

in actual and consequential damages, fees, costs and pre-judgment interest, and awarding post-judgment interest. The Company has appealed this judgment. The Company has presented in its briefing numerous and strong bases for appeal, and we believe we will prevail on appeal. Because the appellate proceedings are ongoing, we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, but we expect the amount of any loss to be immaterial.

Taxes Other Than Payroll and Income Taxes

In 2017, the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court decided that the state value-added tax (VAT) should not be

included in the basis of federal VAT calculations.  In 2018 and 2019, the Brazilian tax authorities published both an internal consultation and a normative ruling with a narrow interpretation of the effects of the case.  We have determined that any related federal VAT refunds should be recognized when they are both probable and reasonably estimable.  Based upon the best information available to us, we have determined that the amount of refund that is probable of being realized is limited to that determined by the tax authorities’ narrow interpretation, for which we have recognized a receivable of

$


million

as of December 31, 2019. Upcoming court decisions and guidance from the tax authorities could expand the scope of the federal VAT refunds.

General

The Company is involved in various other inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation relating to environmental and safety matters, personal injury, product liability, labor and employment, contracts, sales of property, intellectual property, tax and other matters, some of which allege substantial monetary damages. See

Note 13

for details regarding a tax matter. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events, can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions, and are otherwise subject to significant uncertainties. As a result, there can be no certainty that the Company will not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. The Company believes that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described herein, will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Company. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in pending or threatened legal matters, some of which are beyond the Company’s control, and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, a future adverse ruling, settlement, unfavorable development, or increase in accruals with respect to these matters could result in future charges that could be material to the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.

NOTE 15 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

In connection with the 2006 sale of approximately

5.6

million

acres of forestlands, International Paper received installment notes (the Timber Notes) totaling approximately

$

4.8

billion

.

The Timber Notes were used as collateral for borrowings from third party lenders, which effectively monetized the Timber Notes through the creation of newly formed special purposes entities (the Entities). The monetization structure preserved the tax deferral that resulted from the 2006 forestlands sales. As of



December 31, 2019, this deferred tax liability was

$


million

.

During 2015, International Paper initiated a series of actions in order to extend the 2006 monetization structure and maintain the long-term nature of the deferred tax liability.  The Entities, with assets and liabilities primarily consisting of the Timber Notes and third-party bank loans (the Extension Loans), were restructured which resulted in the formation of wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities (the 2015 Financing Entities).

The Timber Notes are shown in Financial assets of variable interest entities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and mature in

August 2021

unless extended for an additional

five years

. These notes, which do not require principal payments prior to their maturity, are supported by approximately

$

4.8

billion

of irrevocable letters of credit.

The Extension Loans are shown in Current nonrecourse financial liabilities of variable interest entities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and mature in the fourth quarter of 2020. These bank loans, totaling approximately

$

4.2

billion

, are nonrecourse to the Company, and are secured by approximately

$

4.8

billion

of Timber Notes, the irrevocable letters of credit supporting the Timber Notes and approximately

$


million

of International Paper debt obligations. The

$


million

of International Paper debt obligations are eliminated in the consolidation of the 2015 Financing Entities and are not reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Provisions of loan agreements related to approximately

$

1.1

billion

of the Extension Loans require the bank issuing letters of credit supporting the Timber Notes pledged as collateral to maintain a credit rating at or above a specified threshold. In the event the credit rating of the letter of credit bank is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of credit must be replaced within


days

with letters of credit from a qualifying financial institution.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of the Timber Notes was

$

4.9

billion

and

$

4.7

billion

, respectively, and the fair value of the Extension Loans  was

$

4.3

billion

and

$

4.2

billion

for the years ended 2019 and 2018. The Timber Notes and Extension Loans are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in

Note 17

.

Activity between the Company and the 2015 Financing Entities was as follows:

(a)

The revenue and expense are included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

(b)

The cash receipts are interest received on the Financial assets of variable interest entities.

(c)

The cash payments represent interest paid on Current nonrecourse financial liabilities of variable interest entities.

In connection with the acquisition of Temple-Inland in February 2012, two special purpose entities became wholly-owned subsidiaries of International Paper. The use of the two wholly-owned special purpose entities discussed below preserved the tax deferral that resulted from the 2007 Temple-Inland timberlands sales. As of December 31, 2019, this deferred tax liability was

$


million

, which will be settled with the maturity of the notes in


.

In October 2007, Temple-Inland sold

1.55

million

acres of timberland for

$

2.4

billion

. The total consideration consisted almost entirely of notes due in


issued by the buyer of the timberland, which Temple-Inland contributed to two wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities. The notes are shown in Financial assets of variable interest entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are supported by

$

2.4

billion

of irrevocable letters of credit issued by three banks, which are required to maintain minimum credit ratings on their long-term debt. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of the notes was

$

2.3

billion

and

$

2.2

billion

, respectively. These notes are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in

Note 17

.

In December 2007, Temple-Inland's two wholly-owned special purpose entities borrowed

$

2.1

billion

which is shown in Long-term nonrecourse financial liabilities of variable interest entities. The loans are repayable in


and are secured by the

$

2.4

billion

of notes and the irrevocable letters of credit securing the notes, and are nonrecourse to us. The loan agreements provide

that if a credit rating of any of the banks issuing the letters of credit is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of credit issued by that bank must be replaced within


days

with letters of credit from another qualifying financial institution. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of this debt was

$

2.1

billion

and

$

2.0

billion

, respectively. This debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in

Note 17

.

Activity between the Company and the 2007 financing entities was as follows:



(a)

The revenue is included in Interest expense, net, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and includes approximately

$


million

for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of accretion income for the amortization of the purchase accounting adjustment on the Financial assets of variable interest entities.

(b)

The expense is included in Interest expense, net, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and includes approximately

$


million

for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of accretion expense for the amortization of the purchase accounting adjustment on the Long-term nonrecourse financial liabilities of variable interest entities.

(c)

The cash receipts are interest received on the Financial assets of special purpose entities.

(d)

The cash payments are interest paid on Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities.

0.15

%

payable annually. The liquidity facilities also include up to

$


million

of uncommitted  financings based on eligible receivables balances under a receivables securitization program that expires in

December 2020

. At

December 31, 2019

, there were no borrowings under either the bank facility or receivables securitization program.

The Company’s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth, as defined in our debt agreements, of

$


billion

and a total debt-to-capital ratio of less than


%

. Net worth is defined as the sum of common stock, paid-in capital and retained earnings, less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges. The calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and both the current and long-term Nonrecourse Financial Liabilities of Variable Interest Entities. The total debt-to-capital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth. As of

December 31, 2019

, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.

NOTE 17 DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

International Paper periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and currency risks. International Paper does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. For hedges that meet the hedge accounting criteria, International Paper, at inception, formally designates and documents the instrument as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge of a specific underlying exposure.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount.

Interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in interest expense. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. The ineffective portion for both cash flow and fair value hedges, which is not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

We manufacture and sell our products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The purpose of our foreign currency hedging program is to manage the volatility associated with the changes in exchange rates.

To manage this exchange rate risk, we have historically utilized a combination of forward contracts, options and currency swaps. Contracts that qualify are designated as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies or net investment hedges of foreign denominated subsidiaries. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion, which is not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings. For net investment hedges, all changes in the  fair value of these instruments are recorded in AOCI, offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in AOCI.

The change in value of certain non-qualifying instruments used to manage foreign exchange exposure of intercompany financing transactions and certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation is immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure.

COMMODITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Certain raw materials used in our production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility in earnings due to price fluctuations, we may utilize swap contracts or forward purchase contracts.



Derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair values, unless the derivative instruments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) exception under GAAP and such exception has been elected.  If the NPNS exception is elected, the fair values of such contracts are not recognized on the balance sheet.

Contracts that qualify are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases. The effective portion of the changes in fair value for these instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective and non-qualifying portions, which are not material for any year presented, are immediately recognized in earnings. The change in the fair value of certain non-qualifying instruments used to reduce commodity price volatility is immediately recognized in earnings.

The notional amounts of qualifying and non-qualifying instruments used in hedging transactions were as follows:

(a)

These contracts had maturities of

two years

or less as of

December 31, 2019

.

The following table shows gains or losses recognized in AOCI, net of tax, related to derivative instruments:

During the next

12 months

, the amount of the

December 31, 2019

AOCI balance, after tax, that is expected to be reclassified to earnings is a gain of

The amounts of gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statement of operations on qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions were as follows:

related to debt reduction recorded to Restructuring and other charges.

Fair Value Measurements

International Paper’s financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value consist of derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts, options and other financial instruments that are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and currency risks.  For these financial instruments, fair value is determined at each balance sheet date using an income approach.

The guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures sets out a fair value hierarchy that groups fair value measurement inputs into the following three classifications:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets.

Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. All of International Paper’s derivative fair value measurements use Level 2 inputs.

Below is a description of the valuation calculation and the inputs used for each class of contract:

Interest Rate Contracts

Interest rate contracts are valued using swap curves obtained from an independent market data provider. The market value of each contract is the sum of the fair value of all future interest payments between the contract counterparties, discounted to present value. The fair value of the future interest payments is determined by comparing the contract rate to the derived forward

interest rate and present valued using the appropriate derived interest rate curve.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Foreign currency forward and option contracts are valued using standard valuation models. Significant inputs used in these standard valuation models are foreign currency forward and interest rate curves  and a volatility measurement.  The fair value of each contract



is present valued using the applicable interest rate. All significant inputs are readily available in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions.

Electricity Contract

The Company is party to an electricity contract used to manage market fluctuations in energy pricing. The Company's electricity contract is valued using the Mid-C index forward curve obtained from the Intercontinental

Exchange. The market value of the contract is the sum

of the fair value of all future purchase payments between the contract counterparties, discounted to present value. The fair value of the future purchase payments is determined by comparing the contract price to the forward price and present valued using International Paper's cost of capital.

Since the volume and level of activity of the markets that each of the above contracts are traded in has been normal, the fair value calculations have not been adjusted for inactive markets or disorderly transactions.

The following table provides a summary of the impact of our derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet:

Fair Value Measurements

Level 2 – Significant Other Observable Inputs

(a)

Includes

$


million

recorded in Other current assets and

$


million

recorded in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

(c)

Included

$


million

recorded in Other accrued liabilities  and

$


million

recorded in Other liabilities the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

(d)

Included in Other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The above contracts are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that provide rights of offset with each counterparty when amounts are payable on the same date in the same currency or in the case of certain specified defaults. Management has made an accounting policy election to not offset the fair value of recognized derivative assets and derivative liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.  The amounts owed to the counterparties and owed to the Company are considered immaterial with respect to each counterparty and in the aggregate with all counterparties.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

International Paper evaluates credit risk by monitoring its exposure with each counterparty to ensure that exposure stays within acceptable policy limits. Credit

risk is also mitigated by contractual provisions with the majority of our banks. Certain of the contracts include a credit support annex that requires the posting of collateral by the counterparty or International Paper based on each party’s rating and level of exposure. Based on the Company’s current credit rating, the collateral threshold is generally

$


million

.

If the lower of the Company’s credit rating by Moody’s or S&P were to drop below investment grade, the Company would be required to post collateral for all of its derivatives in a net liability position, although no derivatives would terminate. The fair value of derivative instruments containing credit-risk-related contingent features in a net  liability position was

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

. As of

December 31, 2018

, there were no derivative instruments containing credit-risk-



related contingent features in a net liability position.  The Company was  not required to post any collateral as of

December 31, 2019

NOTE 19 RETIREMENT PLANS

International Paper sponsors and maintains the Retirement Plan of International Paper Company (the Pension Plan), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides retirement benefits to substantially all U.S. salaried employees and hourly employees (receiving salaried benefits) hired prior to July 1, 2004,

and substantially all other U.S. hourly union and non-union employees who work at a participating business unit regardless of hire date. These employees generally

are eligible to participate in the Pension Plan upon attaining


years of age and completing one year of

eligibility service. U.S. salaried employees and hourly employees (receiving salaried benefits) hired after June 30, 2004 are not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan, but receive a company contribution to

their individual savings plan accounts (see Other U.S. Plans); however, salaried employees hired by Temple Inland prior to March 1, 2007 or Weyerhaeuser Company's Cellulose Fibers division prior to December 1, 2011 also participate in the Pension Plan. The Pension Plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of credited service and either final average earnings (salaried employees and hourly employees receiving salaried benefits), hourly job rates or specified benefit rates (hourly and union employees).

The Company also has two unfunded nonqualified defined benefit pension plans: a Pension Restoration Plan available to employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 that provides retirement benefits based on eligible compensation in excess of limits set by the Internal Revenue Service, and a supplemental retirement plan for senior managers (SERP), which is an alternative retirement plan for salaried employees who are senior vice presidents and above or who are designated by the chief executive officer as participants. These nonqualified plans are only funded to the extent of benefits paid, which totaled

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

in


,


and


, respectively, and which are expected to be

$


million

in


.

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company froze participation, including credited service and compensation, for salaried employees under the Pension Plan, the Pension Restoration Plan and the  SERP plan. This change does not affect benefits accrued through December 31, 2018. For service after December 31, 2018, employees affected by the freeze receive a company contribution to their individual  Retirement Savings Account as described later in this

Note 19

.

Many non-U.S. employees are covered by various retirement benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes.



OBLIGATIONS AND FUNDED STATUS

ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes. These net gains and losses are recognized prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains in subsequent years.



NET PERIODIC PENSION EXPENSE

Service cost is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the plans’ benefit formula to services rendered by employees during the year. Interest cost represents the increase in the projected benefit obligation, which is a discounted amount, due to the passage of time. The expected return on plan assets reflects the computed amount of current-year earnings from the investment of plan assets using an estimated long-term rate of return.

Net periodic pension expense for qualified and nonqualified U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans comprised the following:

(a)    2017 amounts were recorded in Discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations.

The components of net periodic pension expense other than the Service cost component are included in Non-operating pension expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The decrease in 2019 pension expense primarily reflects lower service cost due to the salaried pension freeze, lower amortization and the current year absence of a settlement loss related to the October 2018 annuity purchase transaction slightly offset by lower asset returns due to the 2018 annuity purchase.

On September 25, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America to purchase a group annuity contract and transfer approximately

$

1.6

billion

of International Paper's U.S. qualified pension plan projected benefit obligations, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction closed on October 2, 2018 and was funded with pension plan assets. Under the transaction, at the end of 2018, Prudential assumed responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately

23,000

retirees or their beneficiaries receiving less than

$

1,000

in monthly benefit payments from the plan. Settlement accounting rules required a remeasurement of the qualified plan as of October 2, 2018 and the Company recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of

$


million

before tax in the fourth quarter of 2018.

On September 26, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America to purchase a group annuity contract and transfer approximately

$

1.3

billion

of International Paper's U.S. qualified pension plan projected benefit obligations, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction closed on October 3, 2017 and was funded with pension plan assets. Under the transaction, at the end of 2017, Prudential assumed responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately

45,000

retirees or their beneficiaries receiving less than

$


in monthly benefit payments from the plan. Settlement accounting rules required a remeasurement of the qualified plan as of October 3, 2017 and the Company recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of

$


million

before tax in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, large payments from the non-qualified pension plan also required a remeasurement as of October 2, 2017 and a non-cash settlement charge of

$


million

was also recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017.

ASSUMPTIONS

International Paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of December 31 (the measurement date) and considers changes in these long-term factors based upon market conditions and the requirements for employers’ accounting for pensions. These assumptions are used to calculate benefit obligations as of December 31 of the current year and pension expense to be recorded in the following year (i.e., the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2019

is also the discount rate used to determine net pension expense for the


year).



Major actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for our defined benefit plans are presented in the following table:

(a)

Represents the weighted average rate for the U.S. qualified plans in 2018 and 2017 due to the remeasurements

.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio. Projected rates of return are developed through an asset/liability study in which projected returns for each of the plan’s asset classes are determined after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of returns and volatility of the various asset classes.

Based on the target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio is developed considering the effects of active portfolio management and expenses paid from plan assets. The discount rate assumption was determined from a universe of high quality corporate bonds. A settlement portfolio is selected and matched to the present value of the plan’s projected benefit payments. To calculate pension expense for 2020, the Company will use an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of

7.00

%

for the Retirement Plan of International Paper, a discount rate of

3.40

%

and an assumed rate of compensation increase of

2.25

%

. The Company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately

$


million

for its U.S. defined benefit plans in


, compared to expense of

$


million

in


. The estimated decrease in net pension expense in 2020 is primarily due to higher return on assets and lower interest cost partially offset by higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service cost.

For non-U.S. pension plans, assumptions reflect economic assumptions applicable to each country.

The following illustrates the effect on pension expense for


of a


basis point decrease in the above assumptions:

PLAN ASSETS

International Paper’s Board of Directors has appointed a Fiduciary Review Committee that is responsible for fiduciary oversight of the U.S. Pension Plan, approving investment policy and reviewing the management and control of plan assets. Pension Plan assets are invested to maximize returns within prudent levels of risk.

The Pension Plan maintains a strategic asset allocation policy that designates target allocations by asset class. Investments are diversified across classes and within each class to minimize the risk of large losses. Derivatives, including swaps, forward and futures contracts, may be used as asset class substitutes or for hedging or other risk management purposes. Periodic reviews are made of investment policy objectives and investment manager performance. For non-U.S. plans, assets consist principally of common stock and fixed income securities.



International Paper’s U.S. pension allocations by type of fund at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and target allocations were as follows:

The fair values of International Paper’s pension plan assets at

December 31, 2019

and


by asset class are shown below.  Hedge funds disclosed in the following table are allocated to fixed income accounts for target allocation purposes. Following our adoption of ASU 2018-09 "Codification Improvements", we have evaluated certain investments and classified them as Level 2 (previously Level 0). Prior year leveling disclosures have been updated for comparability as a result of our retrospective adoption of this disclosure guidance.

In accordance with accounting standards, certain investments that are measured at NAV and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.

(a) A private equity fund investment ("partnership interest") is contractually locked up for the life of the private equity fund by the partnership agreement. Limited partners do not have the option to redeem partnership interests.

(a) A private equity fund investment ("partnership interest") is contractually locked up for the life of the private equity fund by the partnership agreement. Limited partners do not have the option to redeem partnership interests.



Equity securities consist primarily of publicly traded U.S. companies and international companies. Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing prices reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.

Fixed income consists of government securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, common collective funds and other fixed income investments. Government securities are valued by third-party pricing sources. Mortgage-backed security holdings consist primarily of agency-rated holdings. The fair value estimates for mortgage securities are calculated by third-party pricing sources chosen by the custodian’s price matrix. Corporate bonds are valued using either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or using a discounted

cash flows approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks. Common collective funds are valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the measurement date. Other fixed income investments of

$(


) million

and

$(


) million

at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily include reverse repurchase agreement obligations in which we have sold a security and have an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same security at a later date for a price specified in the agreement.

Derivative investments such as futures, forward contracts, options and swaps are used to help manage risks. Derivatives are generally employed as asset class substitutes (such as when employed in a portable alpha strategy), for managing asset/liability mismatches, or

bona fide hedging or other appropriate risk management purposes.

Derivative instruments are generally valued by the investment managers or in certain instances by third-party pricing sources.

Hedge funds are investment structures for managing private, loosely-regulated investment pools that can pursue a diverse array of investment strategies with a

wide range of different securities and derivative instruments. These investments are made through funds-of-funds (commingled, multi-manager fund structures) and through direct investments in individual hedge funds. Hedge funds are primarily valued by each fund’s third-party administrator based upon the valuation of the underlying securities and instruments and primarily by applying a market or income valuation methodology as appropriate depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. Funds-of-funds are valued based upon the net asset values of the underlying investments in hedge funds.

Private equity consists of interests in partnerships that invest in U.S. and non-U.S. debt and equity securities. Partnership interests are valued using the most recent general partner statement of fair value, updated for any subsequent partnership interest cash flows.

Real estate funds include commercial properties, land and timberland, and generally include, but are not limited to, retail, office, industrial, multifamily and hotel properties. Real estate fund values are primarily reported by the fund manager and are based on valuation of the underlying investments which include inputs such as cost, discounted cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data.

FUNDING AND CASH FLOWS

The Company’s funding policy for the Pension Plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans, tax deductibility, cash flow generated by the Company, and other factors. The Company continually reassesses the amount and  timing of any discretionary contributions.  Contributions to the qualified plan totaling

$

1.25

billion

were made by the Company in


. No voluntary contributions were made in 2018 or 2019. Generally, International Paper’s non-U.S. pension plans are funded using the projected benefit as a target, except in certain countries where funding of benefit plans is not required.

At

December 31, 2019

, projected future pension benefit payments, excluding any termination benefits, were as follows:

OTHER U.S. PLANS

International Paper sponsors the International Paper Company Salaried Savings Plan and the International Paper Company Hourly Savings Plan, both of which are

tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) savings plans. Substantially all U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees are eligible to participate and may make

elective deferrals to such plans to save for retirement. International Paper makes matching contributions to participant accounts on a specified percentage of employee deferrals as determined by the provisions of each plan. The Company makes Retirement Savings Account contributions equal to a percentage of an eligible employee’s pay. Beginning in 2019, as a result of the freeze for salaried employees under the Pension Plan,  all salaried employees are eligible for the contribution to the Retirement Savings Account.

The Company also sponsors the International Paper Company Deferred Compensation Savings Plan, which is an unfunded nonqualified defined contribution plan. This plan permits eligible employees to continue to make deferrals and receive company matching contributions (and Retirement Savings Account contributions) when their contributions to the International Paper Salaried Savings Plan are stopped due to limitations under U.S. tax law. Participant deferrals and company contributions are not invested in a separate trust, but are paid directly from International Paper’s general assets at the time benefits become due and payable.

Company contributions to the plans totaled approximately

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

for the plan years ending in


,


and


, respectively.   The increase in 2019 reflects increased contributions in connection with the salaried pension plan freeze.

NOTE 20 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

International Paper provides certain retiree health care and life insurance benefits covering certain U.S.



salaried and hourly employees. These employees are generally eligible for benefits upon retirement and completion of a specified number of years of creditable service. International Paper does not fund these benefits prior to payment and has the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans in the future.

In addition to the U.S. plan, certain Brazilian and Moroccan employees are eligible for retiree health care and life insurance benefits.

NOTE 21 INCENTIVE PLANS

International Paper currently has an Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP). The ICP authorizes grants of restricted stock, restricted or deferred stock units, performance awards payable in cash or stock upon the attainment of specified performance goals, dividend equivalents, stock options, stock appreciation rights, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards at the discretion of the Management Development and



Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) that administers the ICP.   Additionally,

restricted stock, which may be deferred into RSU’s, may be awarded under a Restricted Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors.

PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN

Under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), contingent awards of International Paper common stock are granted by the Committee. The PSP awards are earned over a three-year period. PSP awards are earned based on the achievement of defined performance of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) measured against our internal benchmark and ranking of Total Shareholder Return (TSR) compared to the TSR peer group of companies. The 2017-2019 Award is weighted


%

for ROIC and


%

for TSR for all participants except for officers for whom the awards are weighted


%

for ROIC and


%

for TSR. The 2018-2020  and 2019-2021 Awards are weighted


%

ROIC and


%

TSR for all participants. The ROIC component of the PSP awards is valued at the closing stock price on the day prior to the grant date. As the ROIC component contains a performance condition, compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period based on the most probable number of awards expected to vest. The TSR component of the PSP awards is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation as the TSR component contains a market condition. The Monte Carlo simulation estimates the fair value of the TSR component based on the expected term of the award, a risk-free rate, expected dividends, and the expected volatility for the Company and its competitors. The expected term is estimated based on the vesting period of the awards, the risk-free rate is based on the yield on U.S. Treasury securities matching the vesting period, and the volatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility over the expected term. PSP grants are made in performance-based restricted stock units.

The following table sets forth the assumptions used to determine compensation cost for the market condition component of the PSP plan:

The following summarizes PSP activity for the three years ended

NOTE 22 FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA

International Paper’s business segments, Industrial Packaging, Global Cellulose Fibers and Printing Papers, are consistent with the internal structure used to manage these businesses. See the

Description of Business Segments

in

Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

for a description of the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues. All segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.

Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, and excluding interest expense, net, corporate items, net, corporate special items, net, business special items, net, and non-operating pension expense. In 2019, the Company changed its measure of business segment operating profits to exclude items considered by management to be unusual (business special items, net) from the normal operations of the business segment.  As a result, all prior periods have been restated to reflect the current measure.

External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper’s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of

December 31, 2019

, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
