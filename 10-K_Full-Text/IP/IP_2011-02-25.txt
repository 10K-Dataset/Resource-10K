INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY

INDEX TO ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010

PART I.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

International Paper Company (the “Company” or “International Paper,” which may also be referred to as “we” or
“us”) is a global paper and packaging company that is complemented by an extensive North American merchant distribution system, with primary markets and manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Russia, Asia and
North Africa. We are a New York corporation, incorporated in 1941 as the successor to the New York corporation of the same name organized in 1898. Our home page on the Internet is www.internationalpaper.com. You can learn more about us by visiting
that site.

In the United States at December 31, 2010, the Company operated 20 pulp, paper and packaging mills, 144 converting and
packaging plants, 19 recycling plants and three bag facilities. Production facilities at December 31, 2010 in Europe, Asia, Latin America and South America included eight pulp, paper and packaging mills, 67 converting and packaging plants, and
two recycling plants. We distribute printing, packaging, graphic arts, maintenance and industrial products principally through over 224 distribution branches in the United States and 38 distribution branches located in Canada, Mexico and Asia. At
December 31, 2010, we owned or managed approximately 250,000 acres of forestland in Brazil and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government-owned forestlands in Russia. Substantially all of our
businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions.

For management and financial reporting purposes, our businesses are separated into five segments: Industrial Packaging; Printing Papers; Consumer Packaging; Distribution; and Forest Products. Beginning on January
1, 2011, the Forest Products business will no longer be reported by the Company as a separate industry segment due to the immateriality of the results of the remaining business on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. A description
of these business segments can be found on pages 26 and 27 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company’s 50% equity interest in Ilim Holding S.A. is also a separate
reportable industry segment.

From 2006 through 2010, International Paper’s capital expenditures approximated $4.7 billion,
excluding

mergers and acquisitions. These expenditures reflect our continuing efforts to improve product quality and environmental performance, as well as lower costs, maintain reliability of operations
and improve forestlands. Capital spending for continuing operations in 2010 was approximately $775 million and is expected to be approximately $1.2 to $1.3 billion in 2011. You can find more information about capital expenditures on page 34 of
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Discussions of acquisitions
can be found on pages 34 and 35 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

You can find discussions of restructuring charges and other special items on pages 23 and 24 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we “incorporate by reference” certain information in parts of other documents filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC permits us to disclose important information by referring to it in that manner. Please refer to such information. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current
reports on Form 8-K, along with all other reports and any amendments thereto filed with or furnished to the SEC, are publicly available free of charge on the Investor Relations section of our Internet Web site at

as
soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The information contained on or connected to our Web site is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered
part of this or any other report that we filed with or furnished to the SEC.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING INDUSTRY
SEGMENTS

The financial information concerning segments is set forth in Note 18 Financial Information by Industry Segment and
Geographic Area on pages 89 through 91 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
ABOUT INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. OPERATIONS

The financial information concerning international and U.S. operations and export sales is
set forth in Note 18 Financial Information by Industry Segment and Geographic Area on pages 90 and 91 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.



COMPETITION AND COSTS

Despite the size of the Company’s manufacturing capacity for paper, packaging and pulp products, the markets in all of the cited product lines
are large and fragmented. The major markets, both U.S. and non-U.S., in which the Company sells its principal products are very competitive. Our products compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies. We also compete, in
some instances, with companies in other industries and against substitutes for wood and wood-fiber products.

Many factors influence the
Company’s competitive position, including price, cost, product quality and services. You can find more information about the impact of price and cost on operating profits on pages 18 through 33 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You can find information about the Company’s manufacturing capacities on page A-4 of Appendix II.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

The Company sells paper, packaging products and other products directly to end users and converters, as well as through agents, resellers and paper
distributors. We own a large merchant distribution business that sells products made both by International Paper and by other companies making paper, paperboard, packaging and graphic arts supplies. Sales offices are located throughout the United
States as well as internationally.

DESCRIPTION OF PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS

The Company’s principal products are described on pages 26 and 27 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.



SALES VOLUMES BY PRODUCT

Sales volumes of major products for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

Sales Volumes by Product (1) (2)

(1)

Includes third-party and inter-segment sales and excludes sales of equity investees.

(2)

Sales volumes for divested businesses are included through the date of sale, except for discontinued operations.

(3)

Includes Weyerhaeuser Company’s Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling (CBPR) business volumes from date of acquisition in August 2008.

(4)

Includes SCA Packaging volumes from date of acquisition in June 2010.

(5)

Includes internal sales to mills.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Company operates its primary research and development center in Loveland, Ohio, as well as several product laboratories. Additionally, the
Company has an interest in ArborGen, Inc., a joint venture with certain other forest products companies.

We direct research and
development activities to short-term, long-term and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions, and to process, equipment and product innovations. Activities include studies on innovation and improvement of pulping, bleaching,
chemical recovery, papermaking and coating processes; packaging design and materials development; reduction of environmental discharges; re-use of raw materials in manufacturing processes; recycling of consumer and packaging paper products; energy
conservation; applications of computer controls to manufacturing operations; innovations and improvement of products; and development of various new products. Our development efforts specifically address product safety as well as the minimization of
solid waste. The cost to the Company of its research and development operations was $12 million in 2010, $13 million in 2009 and $22 million in 2008. The decrease in cost beginning in 2009 reflects cost cutting measures.

We own numerous patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets relating to our products and to the processes for their production. We also
license intellectual property rights to and from others where necessary. Many of the manufacturing processes are among our trade secrets. Some of our products are covered by U.S. and non-U.S. patents and are sold under well known trademarks. We
derive a competitive advantage by protecting our trade secrets, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and by using them as required to support our businesses.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

International Paper is subject to
extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally. Our continuing objectives include: (1) controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air, water and groundwater to avoid
adverse impacts on the environment, and (2) maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations. A total of $62 million was spent in 2010 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water, and to assure
environmentally sound management and disposal of

waste. We expect to spend approximately $90 million in 2011 for similar capital projects.

In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed or finalized a number of new rules, including Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Reporting (see Climate Change section), Boiler MACT (see below), and more
restrictive National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQSs). During 2010, new NAAQSs were promulgated for nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO


) and we anticipate that over the next 12-18 months additional NAAQSs will also be promulgated. Once implemented these rules could
require significant investments of capital and/or operational changes that could potentially have a material impact on International Paper.

In June 2010, the EPA published four inter-related proposed rules commonly and collectively referred to as “Boiler MACT.” As proposed, these rules require owners of specified boilers to meet very strict
air emission standards for certain substances. The promulgation of these rules has been subject to litigation among various parties and the EPA over a period of several years. In late December 2010, the EPA filed a motion with the U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia to further extend the time to promulgate the Boiler MACT rules for an additional 15 months to take into account the voluminous amount of new data EPA received in the comment period. On January 20, 2011, the
Court denied EPA’s request and granted only one additional month (until February 21, 2011) to complete the rulemaking. On that same day, EPA announced in a press release that it will issue rules by the court-imposed deadline but indicated
that the rules “will be significantly different” than previously proposed. Given EPA’s press release, International Paper cannot speculate on what the rules will require, or their impact on the amount or timing of any related future
capital expenditures. The amount we will spend for environmental control projects in future years will also depend on other new laws and regulations and changes in rules that are likely to be promulgated, such as NAAQSs.

Recognizing these many uncertainties, our forecasts include an estimate of future expenditures that may be required for Boiler MACT and other
regulatory initiatives. These amounts represent our current best estimate of future expenditures, which we believe are likely to change once the regulatory landscape becomes clearer. Our preliminary estimate for environmental control expenditures is
approximately $300 million for 2012 and approximately $350 million for 2013. When regulatory requirements regarding



Boiler MACT become final, including likely subsequent legal challenges, the Company’s environmental, manufacturing and legal professionals will need time to assess fully the potential
impacts on our Company before we will be able to provide a more precise estimate of future environmental control expenditures.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Since 1997, when an international conference on global warming concluded with an agreement known as the Kyoto Protocol, which
called for reductions of certain emissions that may contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, there have been a range of international, national and sub-national regulations proposed or implemented focusing on greenhouse
gas reduction. These actual or proposed regulations apply currently or will apply in countries where we currently have, or may in the future have, manufacturing facilities or investments.

While the European Union (EU) has ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the framework of the Kyoto Protocol does not apply to “underdeveloped
nations.” Three countries where we have operations, Brazil, Morocco, and China, are considered underdeveloped nations by the Kyoto Protocol. Although not subject to the Kyoto Protocol, Brazil and China may adopt greenhouse gas regulations in
the future that may have a material effect on our operations in these countries. Unless extended, the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. A successor to the Kyoto Protocol is under negotiation at the international level. Due to the lack of clarity
around the post-2012 climate control regime, it is not possible at this time to estimate with any certainty the potential impacts of future international agreements on International Paper’s operations.

Under the European Emissions Trading System (EUETS), the EU has committed to greenhouse gas reductions. International Paper had two sites covered
by the EUETS in 2010. While these measures did not have an adverse effect on our European operations in 2010, nor are they expected to have such an impact in 2011, they may have a material adverse effect in the future.

The U.S. has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol nor have efforts in the U.S. Congress to legislate the control of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions been
successful. To date, the activity in the U.S. has been spearheaded by the U.S. EPA and, to some extent, by the states. Pursuant to its GHG Mandatory Reporting

Rule promulgated in 2009, EPA began a process to collect data on emitters of greater than 25,000 tons of greenhouse gas per year. Twenty of our U.S. facilities are covered by and will make
reports as required under this new rule. We do not believe that the reporting rule will have a material impact on our operations. Additionally, the EPA has indicated that it will propose New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for various industry
sectors which will limit GHG emissions from certain sources. Currently, the EPA has not identified the pulp and paper industry in the first phase of sectors to be covered by the new standards. However, we anticipate that, at some future time, pulp
and paper sources will be subject to new NSPS rules. It is uncertain what impacts, if any, future NSPS will have on International Paper’s operations.

Some U.S. states have considered legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by companies and public utilities, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission
inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. One such state is California where International Paper has one site subject to California’s GHG regulatory plan. The final California rules are still being developed and do not take
effect until 2012. Until the rules are finalized, it is unknown whether there will be any adverse impact on our California facility.

It
is difficult to predict whether passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by Congress or various U.S. states, or the adoption of regulations by the EPA or analogous state agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse
gases in areas in which we conduct business, may have a material effect on our operations in the U.S. In addition to possible direct impacts, future legislation and regulation could have indirect adverse effects on International Paper, such as
higher prices for transportation, energy and other inputs, as well as more protracted air permitting processes, causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects.

International Paper has controls and procedures in place to stay adequately informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the U.S. and in other countries where we
operate to ensure we continue to assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material adverse effect on the Company, its operations or financial condition, and whether we have any related disclosure obligations.



In summary, regulation of greenhouse gases continues to evolve in various countries in which we do
business. While it is likely that there will be increased regulation relating to greenhouse gases and climate change, at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate either a timetable for the implementation of any new regulations or our
costs of compliance.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 59,500 employees, 36,120 of whom were located in the United States. Of the U.S. employees,
approximately 23,460 are hourly, with unions representing approximately 13,920 employees. Approximately 10,000 of the union employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (USW).

International Paper and the USW entered into the 2007 Mill Agreement in July 2007, which established the framework for bargaining future local
labor contracts at 14 of our U.S. pulp, paper and packaging mills. In November 2009, International Paper and the USW reached an agreement to integrate into the 2007 Mill Agreement the four mills we acquired from Weyerhaeuser Company in August 2008.

In April 2008, we entered into the 2008 Converting Agreement, which similarly establishes the framework for bargaining future local
labor contracts at 32 of our converting facilities. In March 2010, International Paper and the USW reached an agreement to integrate into the 2008 Converting Agreement the 20 facilities we acquired from Weyerhaeuser Company in August 2008.

These two agreements, the Mill and Converting Agreements, cover several specific items, including but not limited to wages, active
medical benefits, successorship, employment security and health and safety. If local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration, then, under the 2007 Mill Agreement and 2008 Converting Agreement, the local facility
agreements will automatically renew with the same terms in effect at the time of expiration. Individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other items not covered by these agreements.

During 2010, labor agreements for four mills expired. Three of the four, Port Hueneme, California, Red River, Louisiana and Riegelwood, North
Carolina are

covered by the 2007 Mill Agreement. Local agreements at Port Hueneme and Red River renewed with the same terms. Minor changes were negotiated at Courtland, Alabama (non-exempt union not covered
by the 2007 Mill Agreement) and Riegelwood.

During 2011, labor agreements that are scheduled to expire at the mills in Georgetown,
South Carolina, Riverdale (Selma), Alabama and Vicksburg, Mississippi will automatically renew under the terms of the 2007 Mill Agreement if new agreements are not reached.

With regard to converting facilities, during 2010 International Paper negotiated six contracts covering 13 locations represented by IBT District Council 2. Labor agreements were renewed at Omaha, Nebraska,
Springhill, Louisiana, Butler, Indiana, Forest Park, Georgia, Three Rivers, Michigan and Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania pursuant to the 2008 Converting Agreement. Labor agreements were negotiated at two additional converting facilities covered by the
2008 Converting Agreement (Magnolia, Mississippi and Bellmawr, New Jersey). Labor agreements also were reached at seven additional converting, distribution and consumer packaging locations that were not covered by the 2008 Converting Agreement. A
one year extension was negotiated at Louisville, Kentucky.

Additionally during 2010, International Paper announced the shutdown of
facilities in Jonesboro, Arkansas, Newport News, Virginia, Spartanburg, North Carolina and Bellevue, Washington. Effects of the closings were bargained where applicable.

During 2011, 20 labor agreements are scheduled to be negotiated in 19 converting, distribution and consumer packaging facilities. Seven of these agreements will automatically renew under the terms of the 2008
Converting Agreement if new agreements are not reached. Thirteen of these agreements are not covered by the 2008 Converting Agreement.

RAW MATERIALS

Raw materials essential to our businesses include wood fiber, purchased in the form of pulpwood, wood chips and old corrugated containers (OCC),
and certain chemicals, including caustic soda and starch. Information concerning fiber supply purchase agreements that were entered into in connection with the Company’s 2006 Transformation Plan is presented in Note 10 Commitments and
Contingent Liabilities on page 71 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in particular, statements found in Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that are not historical in nature may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are often identified by the words, “will,” “may,”
“should,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “appear,” “project,” “estimate,” “intend,” and words of a similar nature. Such
statements reflect the current views of International Paper with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these
statements. Factors



which could cause actual results to differ relate to: (i) increases in interest rates; (ii) industry conditions, including but not limited to changes in the cost or availability of raw
materials, energy and transportation costs, competition we face, cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences, demand and pricing for our products; (iii) global economic conditions and political changes, including but not limited to the
impairment of financial institutions, changes in currency exchange rates, credit ratings issued by recognized credit rating organizations, the amount of our future pension funding obligation, changes in tax laws and pension and health care costs;
(iv) unanticipated expenditures related to the cost of compliance with existing and new environmental and other governmental regulations and to actual or potential litigation; and (v) whether we experience a material disruption at one of
our manufacturing facilities and risks inherent in conducting business through a joint venture. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (particularly in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations), or in the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any
forward-looking statement.

RISKS RELATING TO INDUSTRY CONDITIONS

CHANGES IN THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION COULD AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.

We rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled
fiber, caustic soda and starch), energy sources (principally natural gas, coal and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. The market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. In addition, the
increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have
fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future.

Our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.

THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE EXPERIENCE BOTH ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICES OF, AND
THE DEMAND FOR, OUR PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry
capacity and general economic conditions. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. In addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber-based products and non-fiber
substitutes. Consequently, our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products.

COMPETITION
IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We operate in a competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally, in all of our operating segments. Product or pricing strategies
pursued by competitors could negatively impact our financial results.

RISKS RELATING TO MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS

ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN GENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

General economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and consumer
confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. In addition, a return to volatility in the capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.

CHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS ISSUED BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED
STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FINANC

ING AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE



MARKET PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

Maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy, and a downgrade of our Company’s ratings below
investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, and increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. Similarly,
we are subject to the risk that one of the banks that has issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting the installment notes issued in connection with sales of our forestlands is downgraded below a required rating. If this were to happen, it may
subject the Company to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of deferred taxes if a replacement bank cannot be obtained.

THE IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

We have exposure to counterparties with which we execute transactions,
including U.S. and foreign commercial banks, insurance companies, investment banks, investment funds and other financial institutions, some of which may be exposed to ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, liquidity, default or similar risks, especially in
connection with recent financial market turmoil. A ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, receivership, default or similar event involving a counterparty may adversely affect our access to capital, liquidity position, future business and results of
operations.

OUR PENSION AND HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FACTORS WHICH COULD CAUSE THESE COSTS TO CHANGE.

We have
defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date. We provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our
U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees. Our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income
investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods. Likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount
rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension and health care costs. Significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

OUR PENSION PLANS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERFUNDED, AND OVER TIME WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CASH
PAYMENTS TO THE PLANS, REDUCING THE CASH AVAILABLE FOR OUR BUSINESS.

We record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. The benefit liability recorded under
the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” at December 31, 2010 was $1.5 billion. The amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors,
principally the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.

CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL
CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the United States in which we have manufacturing
facilities or sell our products. Specifically, Brazil, Russia, Poland and China, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities, are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world.
Downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences, fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could
negatively affect our financial results.

RISKS RELATING TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS

EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REQUIREMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Our operations are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety. There can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing
and new laws and requirements, including with global climate change laws and regulations, Boiler MACT and National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQSs), will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will
be adequate to cover future costs.

RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS.

The costs and other effects of pending litigation



against us cannot be determined with certainty. Although we believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims, or all of them combined, will not have a material adverse
effect on our business or consolidated financial statements, there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS

MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS AT ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We operate our facilities in
compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. A material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting
customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events,
including:

•

fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;

•

the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;

•

terrorism or threats of terrorism;

•

domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our Company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the
world;

•

unscheduled maintenance outages;

•

prolonged power failures;

•

an equipment failure;

•

a chemical spill or release;

•

explosion of a boiler;

•

disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;

•

labor difficulties; and

•

other operational problems.

Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products
and/or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. If one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower
sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.

SEVERAL OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED BY JOINT VENTURES THAT WE
CANNOT OPERATE SOLELY FOR OUR BENEFIT.

Several operations, particularly in emerging markets, are carried on by joint ventures such as the Ilim joint venture in Russia. In joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or
more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. In general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business
as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. In joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our
co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. In addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits
from our successful joint ventures. For additional information with respect to our Ilim joint venture, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Liquidity and Capital Resources

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

International Paper experienced a transition year in 2010, as we emerged from one of the worst recessions in decades to end the year with our highest fourth-quarter earnings per share in over ten years. The strong
fourth quarter wrapped up a strong 2010. Our earnings per share before special items were more than twice what they were in 2009. The levers for improvement during 2010 included higher price realizations, volume recovery, better operations, and a
significantly higher contribution from our Ilim joint venture in Russia. The primary downside came from input costs, where we saw pressure on virgin and recycled fiber costs. However, we were able to overcome these higher costs and expand our
margins during 2010. We saw improvements across all of our segments and in each of our geographic regions.

The health of our balance
sheet remains strong. We generated free cash flow before dividends of approximately $1.7 billion (see reconciliation on page 33), in spite of increased capital spending. We also continued to reduce debt, made voluntary contributions to our qualified
U.S. pension plan totaling $1.15 billion and increased our annual dividend from $0.10 to $0.75 through an increase early in 2010 and another in early 2011.

Looking ahead, we believe that we continue to operate in a recovering, but not fully recovered, economy. Therefore we expect 2011 to be a year of accelerating improvement for International Paper. The first quarter
has traditionally been seasonally slow and we expect first quarter results to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2010, with stable volumes, prices and operations offset by rising input costs. We will also see a higher contribution from
Ilim during the first quarter, which will represent their fourth quarter 2010 operations as they are reported on a one-quarter lag. As the global economy continues to recover, we expect price realizations and volumes to improve throughout 2011.

Earnings per share attributable to International Paper Company common shareholders before special items is a non-GAAP measure. Diluted
earnings (loss) per share attributable to International Paper Company shareholders is the most direct comparable GAAP measure. The Company calculates

earnings per share before special items by excluding the after-tax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under GAAP. Management uses this measure to
focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. The Company believes that using this information, along with the most direct
comparable GAAP measure, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations. The following is a reconciliation of earnings per share attributable to International Paper Company common shareholders before special items to diluted
earnings (loss) per share attributable to International Paper Company common shareholders.

Results of
Operations

Industry segment operating profits are used by International Paper’s management to measure the earnings
performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes, equity
earnings, noncontrolling interests, interest expense, corporate items and corporate special items. Industry segment operating profits are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-GAAP financial measure, and are not GAAP
alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

International Paper operates in five segments: Industrial Packaging, Printing Papers, Consumer Packaging, Distribution, and Forest Products.



The following table shows the reconciliation of industry segment operating profits to net earnings
(loss) attributable to International Paper Company for each of the last three years:

*

Includes the impact of segment restructuring charges in all years and alternative fuel mixture credits in 2009.

**

Corporate special items include restructuring and other charges, goodwill impairment charges, gains on Transformation Plan forestland sales and net losses
on sales and impairments of businesses.

Industry segment operating profits of $1.7 billion were $674 million
lower in 2010 than in 2009 due principally to a $344 million net loss from special items in 2010 compared with an $898 million net gain in 2009 (which included the impact of alternative fuel mixture credits). Operationally, the impacts of higher
energy and raw material costs ($548 million), higher distribution costs ($95 million), a bad debt provision for a large envelope company ($17 million), higher mill outages ($47 million), and other items ($15 million) were more than offset by higher
average prices ($798 million), higher sales volumes ($269 million), improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix ($154 million), and higher earnings from land and mineral sales ($69 million).

The principal changes in operating profit by segment were as follows:

•

Industrial Packaging’s profits of $826 million were $65 million higher as the benefits of higher sales volumes and decreased lack-of-order downtime,
higher average sales price realizations and favorable operating costs were partially offset by higher planned maintenance downtime costs, and higher raw material and freight costs. In addition, 2010 operating profits included $19 million of plant
closure costs, while 2009 operating profits included a gain of $849 million relating to alternative fuel mixture credits and $740 million of costs associated with the closures of the Albany, Oregon and Pineville, Louisiana mills, a paper machine at
the Valliant, Oklahoma mill and the Etienne mill in France.

•

Printing Papers’ profits of $481 million were $610 million lower. The benefits of higher sales price realizations and lower operating costs were
partially offset by the net impact of lower sales volumes, higher raw material and freight costs, and higher planned mill maintenance downtime costs. Operating profits included $315 million in 2010 and $223 million in 2009 of costs associated with
the closure of the Franklin, Virginia mill. In addition, operating profits in 2009 included $884 million of alternative fuel mixture credits and $34 million of other restructuring costs.

•

Consumer Packaging’s profits of $207 million were down $226 million as the benefits from higher sales volumes and lower lack-of-order downtime, higher
sales price realizations, and lower operating costs were partially offset by higher raw material and freight costs. Operating profits in 2009 included $330 million of alternative fuel mixture credits and $67 million of charges associated with the
shutdown of the Franklin, Virginia mill.



•

Distribution’s profits of $78 million increased $28 million due to higher sales volumes and average sales margins partially offset by higher operating
costs.

•

Forest Products’ profits of $94 million increased $69 million reflecting a $39 million gain on a mineral rights sale and a $50 million gain on land sales
in 2010.

Corporate items, net, of $226 million of expense in 2010 were higher than the $181 million of expense in
2009 due primarily to higher pension expenses. The increase in 2009 versus $103 million of expense in 2008 was due to higher pension expenses.

Corporate special items, including restructuring and other items, impairments of goodwill, gains on Transformation Plan forestland sales and net losses (gains) on sales and impairments of businesses, were a loss of
$45 million in 2010 compared with a loss of $334 million in 2009 and a loss of $1.9 billion in 2008. The loss in 2008 includes $1.8 billion of goodwill impairment charges.

Interest expense, net, was $608 million in 2010 compared with $669 million in 2009 and $492 million in 2008. The decrease in 2010 reflects the repayment of $3.1 billion of debt in 2009. The increase in 2009
reflects the issuance of approximately $6.0 billion of debt in connection with the acquisition of the CBPR business in 2008 and higher interest rates in 2009 due to refinancing actions taken to extend debt maturities.

The 2010 income tax provision of $221 million includes a $14 million tax expense for an incentive compensation deferred tax write-off, a $32
million tax expense for a Medicare Part D deferred tax write-off and a $40 million net tax benefit related to cellulosic bio-fuel credits. The 2009 income tax provision of $469 million includes a net $165 million provision related to 2009 special
tax adjustment items. The 2008 income tax provision of $162 million includes a net $11 million benefit related to 2008 special tax adjustment items. Excluding the tax effect of all special items, taxes as a percent of pre-tax earnings were 30% in
both 2010 and 2009 compared with 31.5% in 2008. The higher income tax rate in 2008 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions.

Discontinued Operations

In 2008, $13 million of net adjustments were recorded relating to post-closing adjustments and estimates associated with prior sales of discontinued businesses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

For
the year ended December 31, 2010, International Paper generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from continuing operations compared with $4.7 billion, including $1.7 billion from alternative fuel mixture credits, in 2009. Capital spending for 2010
totaled $775 million, or 53% of depreciation and amortization expense. Cash expenditures for acquisitions totaled $152 million, while net reductions of debt totaled $383 million. Our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $2.5
billion of committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements. Maintaining an investment-grade credit rating for our long-term debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy.

We expect to generate strong free cash flow again in 2011 and will continue our balanced use of cash through investments in capital
projects, the continued reduction of total debt, including the Company’s unfunded pension obligation, returning value to shareholders (including the funding of our previously announced dividend increases) and strengthening our businesses
through acquisitions, as appropriate.

Capital spending for 2011 is targeted at $1.2 to $1.3 billion, or about 86% to 93% of depreciation and
amortization.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates

Accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial position, and that can require judgments
by management in their application, include accounting for contingent liabilities, impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, pension and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes.



Legal

See page 45 and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of legal matters.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW

While the operating results for International Paper’s various business segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes
in International Paper’s operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in North America, Europe, Russia, Latin America, Asia and North Africa. Factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial
non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels, and movements in currency exchange rates.

Product prices are affected by general economic trends, inventory levels, currency movements and worldwide capacity utilization. In addition to these revenue-related factors, net earnings are impacted by various
cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood, recycled fiber and chemical costs; energy costs; freight costs; salary and benefits costs, including pensions; and manufacturing conversion costs.

The following is a discussion of International Paper’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, and the
major factors affecting these results compared to 2009 and 2008.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the year ended December 31, 2010, International Paper reported net sales of $25.2 billion, compared with $23.4 billion in 2009 and $24.8
billion in 2008. International net sales (including U.S. exports) totaled $7.5 billion, or 30% of total sales in 2010. This compares to international net sales of $6.4 billion in 2009 and $6.9 billion in 2008.

Full year 2010 net earnings attributable to International Paper Company totaled $644 million ($1.48 per share), compared with net earnings of $663
million ($1.55 per share) in 2009 and a loss of $1.3 billion ($3.05 per share) in 2008. 2008 amounts include the results of discontinued operations.

Earnings from continuing operations attributable to International Paper Company after taxes in 2010
were $644 million, including $246 million of net special item charges, compared with income of $663 million, including $285 million of special item credits in 2009, and a loss of $1.3 billion in 2008, including $2.1 billion of net special item
charges. Compared with 2009, higher mill outage costs, increased average raw material costs, higher distribution costs, a bad debt provision for a large envelope company, higher corporate expenses, and a net special items expense in 2010 compared
with a net gain in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of increased average sales price realizations, higher sales volumes, favorable operating performance, higher earnings from land and mineral sales, and lower net interest expense.
Additionally, 2010 results included higher equity earnings, net of taxes, relating to the Company’s investment in Ilim Holdings, SA.

See Industry
Segment Results on pages 27 through 33 for a discussion of the impact of these factors by segment.



The following table presents a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) attributable to International
Paper Company to its total industry segment operating profit:

Discontinued Operations

2008:

In 2008, net after-tax charges totaling $12 million were recorded for adjustments of net losses (gains) on sales and impairments of businesses
reported as discontinued operations, including a pre-tax charge of $25 million ($16 million after taxes) in the first quarter for the settlement of a post-closing adjustment on the sale of the Beverage Packaging business, and pre-tax gains of $9
million ($5 million after taxes) in the fourth quarter for adjustments to reserves associated with the sale of discontinued businesses.

Income Taxes

A net income tax provision of $221 million was recorded for 2010, including a $14 million tax expense and a $32 million tax expense for incentive compensation and Medicare Part D deferred tax write-offs,
respectively, and a net $40 million tax benefit related to cellulosic bio-fuel tax credits. See discussion on pages 33 and 34. Excluding these items and the tax effect of other special items, the tax provision was $364 million, or 30% of pre-tax
earnings before equity earnings.

A net income tax provision of $469 million was recorded for 2009, including a $156 million expense for
the write-off of deferred tax assets in France, a $15 million write-off of a deferred tax asset for a recycling tax credit in the state of Louisiana, and a $26 million tax benefit related to the settlement of the 2004 and 2005 U.S. federal income
tax audits. Excluding these items and the tax effect of other special items, the tax provision was $190 million, or 30% of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.

A net income tax provision of $162 million was recorded for 2008, including a $40 million tax benefit related to the restructuring of the Company’s international operations and a $29 million charge for
estimated U.S. income taxes on a gain recorded by the Company’s Ilim Holding S.A. joint venture related to the sale of a Russian subsidiary. Excluding these items and the tax effect of other special items, the tax provision was $369 million, or
31.5% of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.

Equity Earnings, Net of Taxes

Equity earnings, net of taxes in 2010, 2009 and 2008 consisted principally of the Company’s share of earnings from its 50% investment in Ilim
Holding S.A. in Russia (see pages 32 and 33).

Corporate Items and Interest Expense

Corporate items totaled $226 million of expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 compared with $181 million in 2009 and $103
million in 2008. The increase in 2010 reflects higher supply chain initiative expenses and higher pension expense. The increase in 2009 from 2008 principally reflects higher pension expense.

Net interest expense totaled $608 million in 2010, $669 million in 2009 and $492 million in 2008. The decrease from 2010 to 2009 reflects the
repayment of $3.1 billion of debt in 2009. The increase from 2008 to 2009 reflects a higher average debt balance due to



the issuance of approximately $6 billion of debt in 2008, mainly in connection with the acquisition of the CBPR business, and higher average interest rates in 2009 due to refinancing actions
taken to extend debt maturities.

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests totaled $21 million in 2010 compared with $18
million in 2009 and $3 million in 2008. The increases in 2010 and 2009 reflect higher earnings for the International Paper & Sun Containerboard Co., Ltd. joint ventures.

Special Items

Restructuring and Other Charges

International Paper continually evaluates its operations for improvement opportunities targeted to (a) focus our portfolio on our core
businesses, (b) rationalize and realign capacity to operate fewer facilities with the same revenue capability and close high cost facilities, and (c) reduce costs. Annually, strategic operating plans are developed by each of our
businesses. If it subsequently becomes apparent that a facility’s plan will not be achieved, a decision is then made to (a) invest additional capital to upgrade the facility, (b) shut down the facility and record the corresponding
charge, or (c) evaluate the expected recovery of the carrying value of the facility to determine if an impairment of the asset value of the facility has occurred. In recent years, this policy has led to the shutdown of a number of facilities
and the recording of significant asset impairment charges and severance costs. It is possible that additional charges and costs will be incurred in future periods in our core businesses should such triggering events occur.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, in conjunction with annual testing of
its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments as of the beginning of the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a $59 million charge to write off all recorded goodwill of its European Coated Paperboard business. Subsequent to this testing
date, and based on interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of December 31, 2008, additional goodwill impairment charges of $1.3 billion and $379 million were recorded for the Company’s U.S. Printing Papers business and its U.S.
Coated Paperboard business, respectively.

No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2010 or 2009.



Net Losses (Gains) on Sales and Impairments of Businesses

Net losses (gains) on sales and impairments of businesses included in Corporate special items totaled a pre-tax gain of $23 million ($13 million
after taxes) in 2010, a pre-tax loss of $59 million ($56 million after taxes) in 2009 and a pre-tax loss of $106 million ($83 million after taxes) in 2008. The principal components of these gains/losses were:

2010:

During the fourth quarter of
2010, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $25 million ($15 million after taxes) as a result of the partial redemption of the 10% interest the Company retained in its Arizona Chemical business after the sale of the business in 2006. The Company
received $37 million in cash from the redemption of this interest.

Also during the fourth quarter of 2010, a $2 million charge, before
and after taxes, was recorded to further write down the long-lived assets of the Company’s Inverurie, Scotland mill which was closed in March 2009.

2009:

During the second quarter of 2009, based on a current strategic plan update of projected future
operating results of the Company’s Etienne, France mill, a determination was made that the current book value of the mill’s long-lived assets exceeded their estimated fair value, calculated using the probability-weighted present value of
projected future cash flows. As a result, a $48 million noncash charge, before and after taxes, was recorded to write down the long-lived assets of the mill to their estimated fair value.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, an $8 million noncash charge, before and after taxes, was recorded to further write down the long-lived assets
of the Company’s Etienne, France mill which was closed at the end of November 2009, to their estimated fair value. In addition, a pre-tax charge of $3 million ($0 million after taxes) was recorded for other items.

2008:

During the first quarter of
2008, a $1 million credit, (before and after taxes), was recorded to adjust the estimated loss for a business previously sold.

In
addition, a $107 million noncash loss ($84 million after taxes) for the impairment of the Inverurie, Scotland mill was recorded in the Printing Papers industry segment.

Industry Segment Operating Profits

Industry segment operating profits of $1.7 billion in 2010 decreased from $2.4 billion in 2009, primarily due to a $344 million net loss from special items in 2010 compared with an $898 million net gain in 2009
(which included the impact of alternative fuel mixture credits). The benefits from higher average prices ($798 million), higher sales volumes ($269 million), improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix ($154 million), and higher
earnings from land sales ($69 million) were offset by the impacts of higher energy and raw material costs ($548 million), higher distribution costs ($95 million), a bad debt provision for a large envelope company ($17 million), higher mill outages
($47 million), and other items ($15 million).

Lack-of-order downtime in 2010 decreased to approximately 170,000 tons. In addition,
capacity was reduced by approximately 2.1 million tons associated with the permanent shutdowns of the Albany, Oregon and Pineville, Louisiana mills and the shutdown of a paper machine at our Valliant, Oklahoma mill in December 2009 and the
permanent shutdown of the Franklin, Virginia mill in April 2010. Lack-of-order downtime in 2009 was approximately 3.6 million tons including approximately 450,000 tons associated with the permanent shutdown of the Albany, Oregon and Pineville,
Louisiana mills and the shutdown of a paper machine at our Valliant, Oklahoma mill and approximately 600,000 tons associated with the permanent shutdown of our Bastrop, Louisiana mill and the shutdown of an uncoated paper machine at our Franklin,
Virginia mill in 2008.

Looking ahead to the 2011 first quarter, demand for North American and European paper and packaging products
will likely remain stable while a seasonal decrease in paper demand is expected in Brazil. Average sales prices are expected to be steady with some pressure on prices to export markets. Input costs in North America are expected to increase for
purchased pulp and chemicals. Planned maintenance downtime costs should be slightly lower reflecting a decrease in Europe, partially offset by increased spending in North America. Earnings from our xpedx distribution business are expected to reflect
seasonally lower sales volumes, but improved average margins. Equity earnings from our Ilim joint venture are expected to increase due to improving market demand and higher average sales price realizations for linerboard.

INDUSTRY SEGMENT RESULTS

Industrial Packaging

Demand for Industrial Packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods production, as well as with demand for processed
foods, poultry, meat and agricultural products. In addition to prices and volumes, major factors affecting the profitability of Industrial Packaging are raw material and energy costs, freight costs, manufacturing efficiency and product mix.

Industrial Packaging

results
include the CBPR business acquired in the 2008 third quarter. Net sales for 2010 increased 11% to $9.8 billion compared with $8.9 billion in 2009, and 28% compared with $7.7 billion in 2008. Operating profits were 9% higher in 2010 than in 2009 and
more than double 2008 levels. Excluding alternative fuel mixture credits, facility closure costs and costs associated with the CBPR integration, operating profits in 2010 were 14% higher than in 2009 and 75% higher than in 2008. Benefits from higher
sales volumes and decreased

lack-of-order downtime ($162 million), the effects of higher sales price realizations ($313 million), favorable operating costs ($40 million) and lower other costs ($22 million) were partially
offset by less favorable mix ($40 million), higher planned maintenance downtime costs ($16 million) and higher raw material and freight costs ($375 million). Additionally, operating profits in 2010 included plant closure costs of $19 million, while
operating profits in 2009 included a gain of $849 million relating to alternative fuel mixture credits, U.S. plant closure costs of $653 million, integration costs associated with the acquisition of the CBPR business of $87 million and costs
associated with the shutdown of the Etienne mill in France of $87 million.

North American Industrial Packaging

results
include the net sales and operating profits of the CBPR business since the August 4, 2008 acquisition date. Net sales were $8.4 billion in 2010 compared with $7.6 billion in 2009 and $6.2 billion in 2008. Operating profits in 2010 were $763
million ($776 million excluding facility closure costs) compared with $791 million ($682 million excluding alternative fuel mixture credits, mill closure costs and costs associated with the CBPR integration) in 2009 and $322 million ($414 million
excluding charges related to the write-up of the CBPR inventory to fair value, CBPR integration costs and other facility closure costs) in 2008.

Sales volumes increased in 2010 compared with 2009 due to stronger customer demand for boxes and for exported linerboard. Average sales price realizations were significantly higher reflecting the impact of 2010
announced price increases for domestic and exported containerboard. Average sales margins for boxes decreased as box sales price increases were outpaced by increases in the raw material cost of containerboard. Input costs were sharply higher,
primarily for recycled fiber, but also for wood and energy, while chemical costs decreased. Freight costs were also higher. Planned maintenance downtime costs increased from 2009 levels, while operating costs were significantly lower reflecting the
fixed cost savings from the closures of the Albany, Oregon and Pineville, Louisiana mills in the 2009 fourth quarter and the realization of cost reduction and synergy initiatives in the box plants. Lack-of-order downtime in 2010 was about 130,000
tons in addition to a capacity reduction of about



1.5 million tons associated with the closures of the Albany, Oregon and Pineville, Louisiana mills and the idling of a paper machine at the Valliant mill in December 2009. Lack-of-order
downtime in 2009 was about 2.2 million tons including 450,000 tons related to the idled paper machine at the Valliant, Oklahoma mill and the December 2009 shutdowns of the Albany, Oregon and Pineville, Louisiana mills.

Looking ahead to 2011, sales volumes in the first quarter are expected to remain at about fourth quarter levels although box volumes may be
impacted by adverse weather conditions in the U.S. Average sales price realizations are expected to decrease reflecting a decline in exported linerboard sales prices, while domestic linerboard sales prices should be about flat and box sales price
realizations should show a modest increase. Input costs for purchased fiber are expected to be higher on average as first-quarter 2011 costs are expected to remain at the late fourth-quarter 2010 level. In addition, wood and energy costs are
expected to increase. Planned maintenance downtime costs should be higher with outages scheduled at three mills. Operating costs are expected to be favorable in both the containerboard and box businesses.

European Industrial Packaging

net sales were
$990 million in 2010 compared with $980 million in 2009 and $1.2 billion in 2008. Operating profits in 2010 were $70 million ($73 million before costs associated with the closure of the Etienne mill in France) compared with a loss of $30 million (a
gain of $57 million excluding costs associated with the closure of the Etienne mill in France) in 2009 and earnings of $64 million in 2008. Sales volumes in 2010 were higher than in 2009 primarily reflecting improved demand for packaging in the
industrial markets. Average sales margins decreased as box price increases only partially offset higher raw material costs for kraft and recycled containerboard. Other input costs were about the same in 2010 as in 2009. Operating costs were
favorable and the business benefitted from the operating cost savings associated with the closure of the Etienne mill in France in November 2009. Operating earnings included $3 million in 2010 and $87 million in 2009 for closure costs associated
with the Etienne, France mill closure.

Entering the first quarter of 2011, sales volumes are expected to be lower reflecting seasonally
weaker demand for agricultural boxes than in the fourth quarter of 2010. Average margins are expected to remain stable as box price increases are expected to partly offset containerboard cost increases in Europe. Operating costs are expected to be
favorable.

Asian Industrial Packaging

net sales for 2010 were $495 million compared with $325 million in 2009 and $350 million in 2008. Operating earnings for the packaging operations were a loss of $7 million (a loss of $4 million excluding facility
closure costs) in 2010 compared with earnings of $3 million in both 2009 and 2008. Earnings in 2010 include the results of SCA Packaging Asia since the acquisition on June 30, 2010, including the impact of incremental integration expenses.

Operating earnings for the distribution activities of the business were about breakeven for 2010 compared with a loss of $3 million in
2009 and earnings of $1 million in 2008. In 2009, an expense of $2 million was taken for the impairment of an investment in a joint venture.

Printing Papers

Demand for Printing
Papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity, direct mail volumes and, for uncoated cut-size products, with changes in white-collar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser
printer paper. Market pulp is further affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage producers in different geographic regions. Principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency, raw material and energy costs and
freight costs.

Printing Papers

net sales for 2010 increased 5% from 2009, but decreased 13% from 2008. Operating profits in 2010 were 56% lower than in 2009, but 1% higher than in 2008. However, excluding alternative fuel
mixture credits and plant closure costs, operating profits in 2010 were 72% higher than in 2009 and 9% higher than in 2008. Benefits from higher sales price realizations ($365 million), lower operating costs ($126 million) and improved mix ($32
million) were partially offset by the net impact of lower sales volumes ($13 million), higher raw material and freight costs ($111 million), higher planned mill maintenance downtime costs ($18 million) and higher other costs ($49 million). In
addition, operating profits in 2010 included $315 million of costs associated with the permanent shutdown of our Franklin, Virginia mill, while operating profits in 2009 included $884 million of alternative fuel mixture credits, $223 million of
shutdown costs for the Franklin, Virginia mill, and $34 million of other restructuring costs.



North American Printing Papers

net sales in 2010 were $2.8 billion compared with $2.8 billion in 2009 and $3.4 billion in 2008. Operating earnings in 2010 were $18 million ($333 million excluding facility closure costs) compared with $746
million ($307 million excluding alternative fuel mixture credits and facility closure costs) in 2009 and $405 million ($435 million excluding shutdown costs for a paper machine) in 2008.

Sales volumes decreased in 2010 compared with 2009 due to reduced production capacity related to the permanent closure of the Franklin, Virginia
mill in the second quarter of 2010 and wood supply constraints in the first quarter of 2010. Average sales price realizations were higher reflecting the realization of price increases for uncoated freesheet paper announced in the first half of 2010.
Input costs for wood, energy and purchased pulp were higher, but were partially offset by lower costs for chemicals. Freight costs increased due to higher fuel costs and overall higher average miles per shipment following the closure of the
Franklin, Virginia mill. Operating costs were unfavorable due to higher depreciation expense related to increased production partially offset by cost savings associated with the closure of the Franklin, Virginia mill. Planned maintenance downtime
costs were also higher. Lack-of-order downtime in 2010 was approximately 21,000 tons compared with 405,000 tons in 2009. In addition, capacity was reduced by 450,000 tons in 2010 due to the closure of the Franklin, Virginia mill in April. Operating
earnings included charges of $315 million in 2010 and $223 million in 2009 for costs associated with the closure of the Franklin, Virginia mill. Operating earnings in 2009 also included $671 million of alternative fuel mixture credits and $9 million
of other shutdown costs.

Entering 2011, first quarter sales volumes are expected to increase reflecting seasonally stronger demand.
Average sales price realizations are expected to be mostly stable. Input costs should continue to rise for energy and chemicals, but wood costs should be about flat. Planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be lower in the 2011
first-quarter compared with the 2010 fourth-quarter.

Brazilian Papers

net sales for 2010 of $1.1 billion increased from $960 million in 2009 and $950 million in 2008. Operating profits for 2010 were $159 million compared with $112 million in 2009 and $186 million in 2008. Sales
volumes in 2010 remained at about 2009 levels. Average sales price realizations for uncoated freesheet paper increased significantly for shipments to Brazilian export markets. Average sales

price realizations for pulp were also higher reflecting stronger market demand as well as supply restrictions resulting from the Chilean earthquake in the first quarter of 2010. Margins were
unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of lower margin export sales when the domestic Brazilian market did not grow as anticipated. Raw material costs were lower for wood and chemicals, but this benefit was offset by higher purchased pulp
costs. Operating costs were lower in 2010, but planned maintenance downtime costs were higher.

Entering 2011, sales volumes are
expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to seasonally weaker customer demand for uncoated freesheet paper. Profit margins are expected to be lower reflecting a less favorable geographic sales mix and lower sales price
realizations in the Brazilian domestic market. Input costs are expected to be slightly higher for chemicals, but operating costs should be favorable.

European Papers

net sales in 2010 were $1.3 billion compared with $1.3 billion in 2009 and $1.7 billion in
2008. Operating profits in 2010 were $197 million ($199 million excluding an asset impairment charge associated with the Inverurie, Scotland mill) compared with $92 million ($115 million excluding expenses associated with the closure of the
Inverurie, Scotland mill) in 2009 and $39 million ($146 million excluding a charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets at the Inverurie, Scotland mill to their estimated realizable value) in 2008.

Sales volumes in 2010 were slightly lower than in 2009 largely due to the closure of the Inverurie, Scotland mill in 2009. Average sales price
realizations for uncoated freesheet paper increased due to improved market conditions and market pulp prices were significantly higher due to strong demand as well as supply restrictions resulting from the Chilean earthquake in the first quarter of
2010. Manufacturing operating costs were favorable due to excellent mill performance and operating efficiencies. Planned maintenance downtime costs were slightly lower. Input costs were higher for wood, energy and purchased pulp, but were lower for
chemicals. Operating profits in 2010 reflect unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.

Looking ahead to 2011, sales volumes in the first
quarter are expected to be slightly lower than in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to seasonally weaker demand for uncoated freesheet paper in Russian markets partially offset by increased demand for uncoated freesheet paper in Europe. Average sales



price realizations should be higher due to increased prices for board and newsprint in Europe. Input costs are expected to be higher for wood, energy and chemicals. Planned maintenance downtime
costs should be lower with no outages planned for the first quarter of 2011 and operating costs are expected to be favorable.

Asian Printing Papers

net sales were $80 million in 2010 compared with $50 million in 2009 and $20 million in 2008. Operating earnings were less than $1
million in all periods.

U.S. Market Pulp

net sales were $715 million in 2010 compared with $575 million in 2009 and $750 million in 2008. Operating earnings in 2010 were $107 million compared with $140 million (a loss of $71 million excluding alternative
fuel mixture credits and plant closure costs) in 2009 and a loss of $156 million (a loss of $33 million excluding costs associated with the permanent shutdown of the Bastrop, Louisiana mill) in 2008.

Sales volumes in 2010 increased from 2009 levels. Average sales price realizations were significantly higher reflecting the impact of stronger
market demand coupled with supply constraints in the first half of the year due to the Chilean earthquake. Average margins improved reflecting an increase in shipments of higher-margin fluff pulp. Input costs increased for wood and energy, but were
partially offset by lower chemical costs. Freight costs increased due to higher fuel costs. Mill operating costs were favorable, but planned maintenance downtime costs were higher. Lack-of-order downtime decreased in 2010 to an immaterial amount
compared with 58,000 tons in 2009.

In the first quarter of 2011, sales volumes are expected to be about flat. Average sales price
realizations are expected to decrease reflecting competitive pressure on paper and tissue pulp prices. Input costs should be about flat. Planned maintenance downtime costs will be higher with outages planned during the first quarter of 2011 at two
mills compared with none in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Consumer Packaging

Demand and pricing for Consumer Packaging products correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity. In addition to prices
and volumes, major factors affecting the profitability of Consumer Packaging are raw material and energy costs, freight costs, manufacturing efficiency and product mix.

Consumer Packaging

net sales in 2010 increased 11% from 2009 and 6% from 2008. Operating profits decreased 52% compared with 2009, but increased significantly compared with 2008. Excluding alternative fuel mixture credits and
facility closure costs, 2010 operating earnings were 21% higher than in 2009 and were significantly higher than in 2008.

Benefits from
higher sales volumes and lower lack-of-order downtime ($76 million), higher sales price realizations ($120 million) and lower operating costs ($13 million) were partially offset by higher raw material and freight costs ($157 million) and higher
other costs ($15 million). In addition, operating profits in 2009 included $330 million of alternative fuel mixture credits and $67 million of costs associated with the permanent shutdown of the Franklin, Virginia mill.

North American Consumer Packaging

net sales
were $2.4 billion in 2010 compared with $2.2 billion in 2009 and $2.5 billion in 2008. Operating earnings in 2010 were $97 million ($105 million excluding facility closure costs) compared with $343 million ($87 million excluding alternative fuel
mixture credits and facility closure costs) in 2009 and $8 million ($38 million excluding facility closure costs) in 2008.

Coated
Paperboard sales volumes were higher in 2010 compared with 2009 reflecting stronger market demand. Average sales price realizations improved as sales prices recovered in the second half of 2010 after declining in the second half of 2009. Raw
material costs for wood, energy and chemicals were higher in 2010 and freight costs also increased. Operating costs were favorable and planned maintenance downtime costs were about even with 2009. The business took approximately 17,000 tons of
lack-of-order downtime in 2010 compared with approximately 300,000 tons in 2009. Capacity in 2010 was reduced by 140,000 tons related to the shutdown of the paperboard machine at the Franklin, Virginia mill at the end of 2009. Operating results in
2009 include income of $330 million for alternative fuel mixture credits and $67 million of expenses for shutdown costs for the Franklin, Virginia mill.

Shorewood sales volumes were lower in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily reflecting weaker demand in the tobacco segment. Sales volumes in



the home entertainment segment in 2010 improved compared with 2009, largely due to a strong fourth quarter. Average sales margins increased reflecting a more favorable mix of products sold, but
this benefit was offset by higher operating costs. Both raw material and freight costs were slightly higher. Charges to restructure operations were $8 million in 2010 compared with $7 million in 2009.

Foodservice sales volumes increased in 2010 compared with 2009 with the majority of the growth coming from new customers and the sale of new
products to existing customers. Average sales price realizations were lower in 2010 due to price decreases in the second half of 2009, but sales prices began to recover in the second half of 2010. Raw material costs were higher primarily for board
and resins. Freight costs were significantly higher, but operating costs were lower.

Entering 2011, Coated Paperboard sales volumes in
the first quarter are expected to be at about fourth-quarter levels. Average sales price realizations should be slightly higher reflecting the continued realization of price increases announced in 2010. Raw material costs for wood and energy are
expected to increase, but chemical costs should be lower. No planned maintenance downtime is scheduled for the first quarter. Shorewood sales volumes are expected to be lower reflecting seasonal decreases in home entertainment segment shipments.
Operating costs are expected to be favorable, and costs for raw materials and freight should be lower. Foodservice sales volumes are expected to be seasonally weaker. Average sales price realizations should be about flat, while raw material costs
should also remain at about fourth-quarter levels.

European Consumer Packaging

net sales in 2010 were $345 million compared with $315 million in 2009 and $300 million in 2008. Operating earnings in 2010 were $76 million compared with $66 million in 2009 and $22 million in
2008. Sales volumes were about flat year-over-year. Average sales price realizations were higher in 2010 compared with 2009 in Poland and Russia reflecting improving market conditions. Raw material costs increased for wood and energy.

Looking forward to 2011, sales volumes in the first quarter are expected to be slightly higher than in the fourth quarter of 2010. Average sales
price realizations are expected to be higher in Europe, but about flat in Russia. Input costs for wood, energy and chemicals should increase. No planned maintenance outages are scheduled for the first quarter of 2011.

Asian Consumer Packaging

net sales were $705 million in 2010 compared with $545 million in 2009 and $390 million in 2008. Operating earnings in 2010 were $34 million compared with $24 million in 2009 and a loss of $13 million in 2008.
Average sales price realizations were significantly higher in 2010 particularly for folding carton board and coated bristols, but were largely offset by higher raw material costs, primarily for pulp. Sales volumes were higher reflecting solid market
demand. Average margins improved due to a more favorable mix of products sold.

In the first quarter of 2011, sales volumes are expected
to be about flat. Average sales price realizations should improve, but are expected to be mostly offset by higher input costs.

Distribution

xpedx

, our distribution business, markets a diverse array of products and supply chain services to
customers in many business segments. Customer demand is generally sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, although the commercial printing segment is also dependent on corporate advertising and promotional spending. Distribution’s
margins are relatively stable across an economic cycle. Providing customers with the best choice and value in both products and supply chain services is a key competitive factor. Additionally, efficient customer service, cost-effective logistics and
focused working capital management are key factors in this segment’s profitability.

Distribution’s

2010 annual sales
increased 3% from 2009, but decreased 15% from 2008 while operating profits in 2010 increased 56% compared with 2009, but decreased 24% compared with 2008.

Annual sales of printing papers and graphic arts supplies and equipment totaled $4.2 billion in 2010 compared with $4.1 billion in 2009 and $5.2 billion in 2008, reflecting weak economic conditions in 2009 and a
slowly recovering 2010 market. Trade margins as a percent of sales for printing papers increased from 2009 and 2008 due to a relative increase in higher margin warehouse sales. Revenue from packaging products was $1.5 billion in 2010 compared with
$1.3 billion in 2009 and $1.7 billion in 2008, but packaging margins declined reflecting a



relative increase in orders shipped mill direct which trade at a lower margin. Facility supplies annual revenue was $1.0 billion in 2010 compared with $1.1 billion in both 2009 and 2008
reflecting a drop in demand among retail customers.

Operating profits were $78 million in 2010 compared with $50 million in 2009 and
$103 million in 2008. Compared with 2009, operating profits improved due to cost reductions and increased sales. Operating profits in 2010 included costs of approximately $10 million related to exiting certain retail store and printing equipment
segments, and for professional fees related to a strategic study of the xpedx business as a whole that will be evaluated during the first half of 2011. Operating profits in 2009 included a $5 million charge for costs associated with the
reorganization of the Company’s xpedx operations in New Jersey.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2011, sales volumes and
earnings are expected to be seasonally lower and could be impacted by adverse weather conditions, but average sales margins are expected to improve. Operating costs are expected to decrease.

Forest Products

Forest Products operating results are driven by the timing and pricing
of specific forestland tract sales.

Operating profits in 2010 included a $39 million gain on the sale of mineral rights on more than 7 million acres throughout the U.S and a gain
of $50 million on the sale of 163,000 acres of land in the southeastern U.S. The Company has substantially completed its land sales and earnings for future land sales are expected to be insignificant. Beginning in 2011, Forest Products will no
longer be reported as a separate industry segment.

Equity Earnings, Net of Taxes – Ilim Holding S.A.

On October 5, 2007, International Paper and Ilim Holding S.A. (“Ilim”) announced the completion of a 50:50 joint venture to operate
in Russia. Due to the complex structure of Ilim’s operations, and the extended time required to prepare consolidated financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the Company reports its
share of Ilim’s operating results on a one-quarter lag basis. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated statement of operations

for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 includes the Company’s 50% share of Ilim’s operating results for the period from October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010,
together with the results of other small equity investments, under the caption Equity earnings, net of taxes. Ilim is reported as a separate reportable industry segment.

The Company recorded equity earnings, net of taxes, of $55 million for Ilim in 2010 compared with an equity loss, net of taxes, of $50 million in 2009 and equity earnings, net of taxes, of $54 million in 2008.
Operating results recorded in 2010 included an after-tax asset impairment charge of $22 million and an after-tax foreign exchange gain of $2 million on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Operating results recorded in 2009 included a
$25 million after-tax foreign exchange loss on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar-denominated debt, a $19 million charge, before and after taxes, to write-off project development expenses, and a $5 million provision, before and after taxes, for the
write-down of assets.

Sales volumes for the joint venture increased year-over-year primarily for pulp and containerboard, reflecting
strong market demand. Average sales price realizations were significantly higher in 2010 than in 2009 for softwood and hardwood pulp in both the Russian domestic market and the Chinese export market as well as for linerboard. Input costs increased,
primarily for wood. The Company received cash dividends from the joint venture of $33 million in July 2010 and $51 million in December 2009.

For Ilim’s 2010 fourth quarter, which will be reported in the Company’s 2011 first quarter, market demand is expected to steadily improve throughout the quarter. Average sales price realizations are
expected to increase for linerboard, while softwood and hardwood pulp prices remain steady. Input costs for wood will be seasonally higher and fuel costs are also expected to increase. Operating costs are expected to be favorable, but the foreign
exchange impact is expected to be unfavorable.

A key element of the proposed joint venture strategy is a long-term investment program in
which the joint venture will invest, through cash from operations and additional borrowings by the joint venture, approximately $1.5 billion in Ilim’s three mills over approximately five years. This planned investment in the Russian pulp and
paper industry will be used to upgrade equipment, increase production capacity and allow for new high-value coated and uncoated paper, pulp and corrugated packaging product development. This capital expansion strategy was initiated in the second
quarter of 2010 with the announcement of a $670 million project to build a



new pulp line at Ilim’s Bratsk mill in Siberia, followed in June by the announcement of a $270 million project to install a new coated and uncoated woodfree paper machine at the Koryazhma
mill. These projects are being financed through additional borrowings by the joint venture and cash flow from operations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

A major factor in
International Paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products. While changes in key cash operating costs, such as
energy, raw material and transportation costs, do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus on cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.

As part of our continuing focus on improving our return on investment, we have focused our capital spending on improving our key paper and
packaging businesses both globally and in North America.

Cash uses during 2010 were primarily focused on voluntary contributions to the
Company’s pension plan and higher capital spending.

Cash Provided by Operations

Cash provided by continuing operations totaled $1.6 billion in 2010 compared with $4.7 billion for 2009 and $2.7 billion for 2008.

The major components of cash provided by continuing operations are earnings from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash income and expense
items and changes in working capital. Earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, decreased by $2.1 billion in 2010 versus 2009 driven mainly by $1.7 billion of cash received from alternative fuel mixture
credits in 2009. Cash used for working capital components, accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable and other totaled $458 million in 2010, down from a source of $479 million in 2009 and a
source of $317 million in 2008. The use of cash in 2010 primarily related to higher accounts receivable balances due to an increase in sales and higher inventory levels at year-end in anticipation of mill outages in the 2011 first quarter.

The Company generated free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Free cash flow is a

non-GAAP measure and the most comparable GAAP measure is cash provided by operations. Management uses free cash flow as a liquidity metric because it measures the amount of cash generated that is
available to maintain our assets, make investments or acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce debt. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operations:

Alternative
Fuel Mixture Credits

The U.S. Internal Revenue Code provided a tax credit for companies that use alternative fuel mixtures to
produce energy to operate their businesses. The credit, equal to $0.50 per gallon of alternative fuel contained in the mixture, is refundable to the taxpayer. In January 2009, the Company received notification that its application to be registered
as an alternative fuel mixer had been approved. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company filed claims for alternative fuel mixture credits covering eligible periods subsequent to November 2008 through October 25, 2009 totaling
approximately $1.7 billion, all of which had been received in cash at December 31, 2009. Additionally, the Company recorded $379 million of alternative fuel mixture credits as a reduction of income taxes payable at December 31, 2009. The
Company recorded these credits using the accrual method of accounting based on the estimated eligible volumes reflected in its filed claims. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated statement of operations includes credits of approximately $2.1
billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 in Cost of products sold ($1.4 billion after taxes), representing eligible alternative fuel mixture credits earned through December 31, 2009, when the credit expired.

Cellulosic Bio-fuel Tax Credit

In a
memorandum dated June 28, 2010, the IRS concluded that black liquor would also qualify for the cellulosic bio-fuel tax credit of $1.01 per gallon produced in 2009. On October 15, 2010, the IRS ruled



that companies may qualify in the same year for the $0.50 per gallon alternative fuel mixture credit and the $1.01 cellulosic bio-fuel tax credit for 2009, but not for the same gallons. To the
extent a taxpayer changes their position and uses the $1.01 credit, they must re-pay the refunds they received as alternative fuel mixture credits attributable to the gallons converted to the cellulosic bio-fuel credit. The repayment of this refund
must include interest.

One important difference between the two credits is that the $1.01 credit must be credited against a
company’s Federal taxable earnings, and the credit may be carried forward against taxable earnings through 2015. In contrast, the $0.50 credit was refundable in cash. The cellulosic bio-fuel credit is required to be included in Federal taxable
income.

The Company filed an application with the IRS on November 18, 2010, to receive the required registration code to become a
registered cellulosic bio-fuel producer. At present, the Company has not received this registration code; however, the Company believes approval of the application for the registration code to be ministerial in nature.

The Company has evaluated the optimal use of the two credits with respect to gallons produced in 2009. Considerations include uncertainty around
future federal taxable income, the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture credit, future liquidity and uses of cash such as, but not limited to, debt re-payments and voluntary pension contributions versus repayment of alternative fuel mixture
credits with interest. At the present time, the Company does not intend to convert any gallons under the alternative fuel mixture credit to gallons under the cellulosic bio-fuel credit. The Company will continue evaluating its position with regard
to the previously claimed alternative fuel mixture credit gallons produced in 2009. This continued evaluation may result in the Company repaying some or all of the cash received with respect to the $0.50 credit, and amendment of the Company’s
2009 tax return. Due to the aforementioned considerations, the Company cannot quantify the value of additional cellulosic bio-fuel credits, but it could be significant.

During 2009, the Company did produce 64 million gallons of black liquor that were not eligible for the alternative fuel mixture credit. The Company does intend to claim these gallons for the cellulosic
bio-fuel credit by amending the Company’s 2009 tax return. The impact of this amendment, is a net $40 million credit to Income tax provision (benefit) for 2010.

As is the case with other tax credits, taxpayer claims are subject to possible future review by the
IRS which has the authority to propose adjustments to the amounts claimed, or credits received.

Investment Activities

Investment activities in 2010 were up from 2009 reflecting an increase in capital spending and the acquisition of SCA Packaging Asia. The Company
maintains an average capital spending target of $1.0 billion per year over the course of an economic cycle. Capital spending for continuing operations was $775 million in 2010, or 53% of depreciation and amortization, compared with $534 million in
2009, or 36% of depreciation and amortization, and $1.0 billion, or 74% of depreciation and amortization in 2008. Across our businesses, capital spending as a percentage of depreciation and amortization ranged from 38% to 70% in 2010.

The following table shows capital spending for continuing operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Capital expenditures in 2011 are currently expected to be about $1.2 to $1.3 billion, or 86% to 93% of depreciation and amortization.

Acquisitions

On June 30, 2010,
International Paper completed the acquisition of SCA Packaging Asia (SCA) for a preliminary purchase price of $205 million, including $171 million in cash plus assumed debt of $34 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. The SCA packaging
business in Asia consists of 13 corrugated box plants and two specialty packaging facilities, which are primarily in China, along with locations in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.

On August 4, 2008, International Paper completed the acquisition of the assets of Weyerhaeuser Company’s Containerboard, Packaging and
Recycling (CBPR) business for approximately $6 billion in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments. In June 2008, the Company had issued $3 billion of



unsecured senior notes in anticipation of the acquisition. The remainder of the purchase price was financed through borrowings under a $2.5 billion bank term loan, $0.4 billion of borrowings
under a receivables securitization program and existing cash balances. The CBPR operating results are included in International Paper’s North American Industrial Packaging business from the date of acquisition.

Financing Activities

2010:

Financing activities during 2010 included debt issuances of $193 million and retirements of $576 million, for a net reduction of $383 million.

In November 2010, International Paper repaid approximately $54 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 7.3% to 9.375% and
original maturities from 2018 to 2039. Pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $13 million related to these debt payments are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

During the third quarter ended September 30, 2010, International Paper repaid approximately $111 million of notes with interest rates ranging
from 5.375% to 6.8% and original maturities from 2016 to 2024.

In May 2010, International Paper repaid approximately $108 million of
notes with interest rates ranging from 5.3% to 9.375% and original maturities from 2015 to 2019. In connection with these early debt extinguishments, interest rate swap hedges with a notional value of $2 million were undesignated as effective fair
value hedges. The resulting gain was immaterial. Pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $18 million related to these debt repayments, net of gains on swap terminations, are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations.

In June 2010, interest rate swap agreements issued in the fourth quarter of 2009 and designated as fair value
hedges with a notional value of $100 million were terminated. The termination was not in connection with the early retirement of debt. The resulting gain of $3 million was deferred and recorded in Long-term debt and will be amortized as an
adjustment of interest expense over the life of the underlying debt through 2019.

During the first quarter of 2010, International Paper
repaid approximately $120 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 5.25% to 7.4% and original maturities from 2010 to 2027. In connection with these early debt retirements, previously deferred gains of $1 million related to earlier swap
terminations were recognized in earnings. Pre-tax early

debt retirement costs of $4 million related to these debt repayments, net of gains on swap terminations, are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement
of operations.

Also in the first quarter of 2010, approximately $700 million of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, issued in 2009,
were terminated. These terminations were not in connection with early debt retirements. The resulting $2 million gain was deferred and recorded in Long-term debt and is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the life of the
underlying debt through April 2015.

International Paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt
and manage interest expense. At December 31, 2010, International Paper had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $428 million and maturities ranging from one to six years. During 2010, existing swaps increased the weighted average
cost of debt from 7.22% to an effective rate of 7.26%. The inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short-term investments reduced this effective rate to 6.86%.

Other financing activities during 2010 included the issuance of approximately 2.6 million shares of treasury stock, net of restricted stock withholding, and 1.8 million shares of common stock for various
plans. Payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $26 million.

In April 2010, International Paper announced that the
quarterly dividend would be increased from $0.025 per share to $0.125 per share, effective for the 2010 second quarter. Additionally, in January 2011, International Paper announced that the quarterly dividend would be increased from $0.125 per share
to $0.1875 per share, effective with the dividend payable March 15, 2011 to shareholders of record on February 15, 2011.

2009:

Financing activities during 2009
included debt issuances of $3.2 billion and retirements of $6.3 billion, for a net reduction of $3.1 billion.

In December 2009,
International Paper issued $750 million of 7.3% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in November 2039. The proceeds from this borrowing, along with available cash, were used to repay the remaining $1 billion of the $2.5 billion long-term debt
issued in connection with the CBPR business acquisition. During 2009, additional payments related to this debt totaled approximately $1.4



billion. Also in connection with the above debt repayment, International Paper undesignated $1 billion of interest rate swaps entered into in 2008 that qualified as cash flow hedges, resulting in
a $24 million loss. This loss was reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss and included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

Also in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company entered into various fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of
approximately $1 billion to hedge existing debt. These interest rate swaps mature within a range of five to ten years.

In December
2009, International Paper Investments (Luxembourg) S.a.r.l, a wholly-owned subsidiary of International Paper, repaid $214 million of notes with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points and an original maturity in 2010. Other debt activity in
the fourth quarter of 2009 included the repayment of approximately $235 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 4.0% to 9.375% and original maturities from 2009 to 2038.

Additional pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $34 million related to fourth-quarter debt repayments and swap activity are included in
Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In August 2009, International Paper issued $1
billion of 7.5% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in August 2021. The proceeds from this borrowing were used to repay approximately $942 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 5.125% to 7.4% and original maturities from 2012 to
2026.

Also during the third quarter in connection with these early debt retirements, interest rate swaps with a notional value of $520
million, including $500 million of swaps issued in the second quarter of 2009, were terminated or undesignated as effective fair value hedges, resulting in a gain of approximately $9 million. In addition, previously deferred net gains of
$7 million related to earlier swap terminations were recognized in earnings. Pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $102 million related to these debt repayments, net of the gains on swap terminations, are included in Restructuring and other
charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

Also in August 2009, International Paper entered into a
fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $100 million due in 2015 to manage interest rate exposure.

In May 2009, International Paper issued $1 billion of 9.375% senior unsecured notes with a maturity
date in May 2019. The proceeds from this borrowing were used to repay approximately $875 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 4.0% to 9.25% and original maturities from 2010 to 2012. Also during the second quarter, International Paper
Company Europe Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of International Paper, repaid $75 million of notes issued in connection with the Ilim Holding S.A. joint venture that matured during the quarter. Pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $25 million
related to second quarter debt repayments and swap activity are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In March 2009, Luxembourg borrowed $468 million of long-term debt with an initial interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 450 basis points that varied depending upon the credit rating of the Company, and a maturity
date in March 2012. International Paper used the $468 million of proceeds from the loan and cash of approximately $170 million to repay its 500 million euro-denominated debt (equivalent to $638 million at date of payment) with an original
maturity date in August 2009. As of the end of the third quarter of 2009, the $468 million loan was repaid. Other debt activities in the first quarter of 2009 included the repayment of approximately $366 million of notes with interest rates ranging
from 4.25% to 5.0% that had matured.

Also in the first quarter of 2009, International Paper terminated an interest rate swap with a
notional value of $100 million designated as a fair value hedge, resulting in a gain of $11 million that was deferred and recorded in Long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As the swap agreement was terminated early, the
resulting gain will be amortized to earnings over the life of the related debt through April 2016.

At December 31, 2009,
International Paper had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $3.2 billion and maturities ranging from one to nine years. During 2009, existing swaps increased the weighted average cost of debt from 6.55% to an effective rate of 6.67%.
The inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short-term investments reduced this effective rate to 6.36%.

Other financing
activities during 2009 included the issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of treasury stock, net of restricted stock withholding, and 3.5 million shares of common stock for various plans. Payments of restricted stock withholding
taxes totaled $10 million.



2008:

Financing activities during 2008 included debt issuances of $6.0 billion and retirements of $696 million, for a net issuance of $5.3 billion.

In August 2008, International Paper borrowed $2.5 billion of long-term debt with an initial interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 162.5 basis
points. The margin varied depending upon the credit rating of the Company. Debt issuance costs of approximately $50 million related to this borrowing were recorded in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
and were being amortized until the debt was repaid in 2009. Also in August 2008, International Paper borrowed approximately $395 million under its receivables securitization program. These funds, together with the $3 billion from unsecured senior
notes borrowed in the second quarter discussed below and other available cash, were used for the CBPR business acquisition in August 2008. As of December 31, 2008, all of the borrowings under the receivables securitization program were repaid.

Also in the third quarter of 2008, International Paper repaid $125 million of the $2.5 billion long-term debt and repurchased $63.5
million of notes with interest rates ranging from 4.25% to 8.70% and original maturities from 2009 to 2038.

The Company also entered
into a series of forward-starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $1.5 billion in anticipation of borrowing for the purchase of the CBPR business. The floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps were effective
September 2008 and matured in September 2010. These forward-starting interest rate swaps were accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company terminated $550 million of these floating-to-fixed
interest rate swap agreements resulting in a loss of approximately $17 million recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet (see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

In the second quarter of 2008, International Paper issued $3 billion of
unsecured senior notes consisting of $1 billion of 7.4% notes due in 2014, $1.7 billion of 7.95% notes due in 2018, and $300 million of 8.7% notes due in 2038. Debt issuance costs of approximately $20 million related to the new debt were recorded in
Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and were amortized over the terms of the respective notes.

Also in the second quarter of 2008, International Paper entered into a series of fixed-to-floating
interest rate swap agreements, with a notional amount of $1 billion and maturities in 2014 and 2018, to manage interest rate exposures associated with the new $3 billion of unsecured senior notes. These interest rate swaps were terminated in
December 2008 along with other existing fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, resulting in a gain of $127 million that was deferred and recorded in Long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. This gain will be amortized over the
life of the related debt through June 2018 (see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

At December 31, 2008, International Paper had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1.4 billion and maturities ranging from one to eight years. During 2008, existing swaps decreased the weighted
average cost of debt from 6.41% to an effective rate of 6.07%. The inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short-term investments further reduced this effective rate to 5.21%.

Other financing activities during 2008 included the issuance of approximately 2.4 million shares of treasury stock for various incentive
plans, including stock option exercises that generated approximately $1 million of cash and restricted stock that did not generate cash. Payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $47 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Variable Interest Entities

During 2006 in connection with the sale of approximately 5.6 million acres of forestlands under the Company’s 2006 Transformation Plan,
the Company exchanged installment notes (the Timber Notes) totaling approximately $4.8 billion and approximately $400 million of International Paper promissory notes for interests in entities formed to monetize the notes. International Paper
determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of these entities, and therefore should not consolidate these entities. During 2006, these entities acquired an additional $4.8 billion of International Paper debt securities for cash, resulting in
a total of approximately $5.2 billion of International Paper debt obligations held by these entities at December 31, 2006. Since International Paper has, and intends to affect, a legal right to offset its obligations under these debt
instruments with its investments in the entities, International Paper has offset $5.1 billion of interest in the entities against $5.1 billion of International Paper debt obligations held by the entities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.



On February 5, 2010, Moody’s Investor Services reduced its credit rating of senior
unsecured long-term debt of the Royal Bank of Scotland N.V. (formerly ABN AMRO Bank N.V.), which issued letters of credit that support $1.4 billion of installment notes received in connection with the Company’s 2006 sale of forestlands
discussed above. Following this sale, the installment notes were contributed to third-party entities that used them as collateral for borrowings from a third-party lender. The related loan agreements require that if the credit rating of any bank
issuing letters of credit is downgraded below a specified level, these letters of credit must be replaced within 60 days by letters of credit from another qualifying institution. The Company, retained to provide management services for the
third-party entities that hold the installment notes, replaced the letters of credit within the required 60-day period.

International
Paper also holds variable interests in two financing entities that were used to monetize long-term notes received from the sale of forestlands in 2001 and 2002. International Paper transferred notes (the Monetized Notes, with an original maturity of
10 years from inception) and cash having a value of approximately $1.0 billion to these entities in exchange for preferred interests, and accounted for the transfers as a sale of the notes with no associated gain or loss. In the same period, the
entities acquired approximately $1.0 billion of International Paper debt obligations for cash. At December 31, 2010, International Paper’s $542 million preferred interest in one of the entities has been offset against related debt
obligations since International Paper has, and intends to affect, a legal right of offset to net-settle these two amounts.

The 2001
Monetized Notes of $499 million, the 2001 International Paper debt obligations of $563 million, and $167 million of the 2002 Monetized Notes, mature in March, June, and the second half of 2011, respectively. International Paper intends to liquidate
its preferred interest in the 2001 financing entities. The 2001 financing entities preferred interest liquidation will reduce Notes Payable and current maturities of long-term debt by $21 million in the first quarter of 2011. Deferred tax
liabilities, associated with the 2001 forestland sales, will be reduced by $155 million as a result of the liquidation. The Company is currently analyzing the cash impact of the liquidation, but does not expect it to significantly impact liquidity.

See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a further
discussion of these transactions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook for 2011

Capital Expenditures and Long-Term Debt

International Paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures, service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend
requirements during 2011 through current cash balances and cash from operations. Additionally, the Company has existing credit facilities totalling $2.5 billion.

The Company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at December 31, 2010. The Company’s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of $9 billion and a total-debt-to-capital
ratio of less than 60%. Net worth is defined as the sum of common stock, paid-in capital and retained earnings, less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges. The calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive loss.
The total-debt-to-capital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth. At December 31, 2010, International Paper’s net worth was $12.4 billion, and the total-debt-to-capital ratio was 41.2%.

The Company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash
flows. Funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives. The primary goals of the Company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense.
The majority of International Paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors.

In February 2011, the Company entered into various fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of approximately $100
million to hedge existing debt. The interest rate swaps were effective February 2011 and mature within the next three to four years. These interest rate swaps were designated as fully effective fair value hedges of the benchmark interest
rate.

Maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of International Paper’s financing strategy. At
December 31, 2010, the Company held long-term credit ratings of BBB (stable outlook) and Baa3 (stable outlook) by S&P and Moody’s, respectively.



Contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase
obligations at December 31, 2010, were as follows:

(a)

Total debt includes scheduled principal payments only. The 2011 debt maturities reflect the reclassification of $100 million of Notes payable and current
maturities of long-term debt to Long-term debt based on International Paper’s intent and ability to renew or convert these obligations, as evidenced by the Company’s available bank credit agreements.

(b)

Represents debt obligations borrowed from non-consolidated variable interest entities for which International Paper has, and intends to affect, a legal
right to offset these obligations with investments held in the entities. Accordingly, in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010, International Paper has offset approximately $5.7 billion of interests in the entities against this
$5.7 billion of debt obligations held by the entities (see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

(c)

Includes $2.3 billion relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the 2006 Transformation Plan forestland sales.

(d)

Not included in the above table due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $188
million.

Pension Obligations and Funding

At December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s U.S. defined benefit plans determined under U.S. GAAP was approximately $1.5 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets.
Approximately $1.1 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements. Under current IRS funding rules, the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan
benefits (the projected benefit obligation) for accounting purposes. In December 2008, the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 (WERA) was passed by the U.S. Congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections.
Funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the Company, and the timing of its implementation, as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any
discretionary contributions and elected to make

voluntary contributions totaling $1.15 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. At this time, we do not expect that the finalization of the funded status as of December 31, 2010
will require the Company to make cash contributions to its plans in 2011, although the Company may elect to make future voluntary contributions. The timing and amount of future contributions, which could be material, will depend on a number of
factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.

Ilim Holding S.A. Shareholder’s
Agreement

In October 2007, in connection with the formation of the Ilim Holding S.A. joint venture (Ilim), International Paper
entered into a shareholders’ agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners. This agreement provides that at any time after the second anniversary of the formation of Ilim, either the Company or
its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions. Under certain circumstances, the Company would be required to purchase its partners’ 50% interest in Ilim. Any such transaction would be subject to review and
approval by Russian and other relevant anti-trust authorities. Based on the provisions of the agreement, International Paper estimates that the current purchase price for its partners’ 50% interests would be approximately $550 million to $600
million, which could be satisfied by payment of cash or International Paper common stock, or some combination of the two, at the Company’s option. Any such purchase by International Paper would result in the consolidation of Ilim’s
financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods. The parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provision of the shareholders’ agreement,
although they have the right to do so.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires International
Paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently
uncertain.

Accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial
position of International Paper, and that can require judgments by management that



affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pensions, postretirement benefits other than
pensions, and income taxes. The following is a discussion of the impact of these accounting policies on International Paper:

Contingent
Liabilities

Accruals for contingent liabilities, including legal and environmental matters, are recorded when it is probable
that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and
recommendations of legal counsel. Liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs. International Paper determines these estimates after a
detailed evaluation of each site.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

An impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount
is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations. A goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. Assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. Additionally, testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually. The amount and
timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices
and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, and various other projected operating economic factors. As these key factors change in future periods, the Company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates
and projections.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

The charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with International Paper’s consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various

assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates.

Income Taxes

International Paper
records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Where the Company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income
tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the Company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations
and facts of each matter. Changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject
tax year, change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred
tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these
assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies.

While
International Paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Goodwill Impairment Analysis

Under
the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,” the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of the Company’s
reporting units is compared with their carrying value, including goodwill. If fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered to be impaired. If the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value, then step two is
performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit. This analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any currently
unrecognized



intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date. Once these fair values have been determined, the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated
as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two. The carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value, or to zero if the fair value of
the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, through a goodwill impairment charge.

The impairment analysis requires a
number of judgments by management. In calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one, the Company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the
unit’s assets, discounted using the estimated cost-of-capital discount rate for each reporting unit. These calculations require many estimates, including discount rates, future growth rates, and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit.
Subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods. Upon completion, the resulting estimated fair values are then
analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions, and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares
outstanding to the Company’s market price per share on the analysis date.

During 2008, as in prior years, the Company performed
the required annual goodwill testing for impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter, resulting in a $59 million impairment charge to write off all goodwill for the Company’s European Coated Paperboard business. Subsequent to this
testing date, the Company performed an interim test as of December 31, 2008 and recalculated the estimated fair value of its reporting units as of that date using updated future cash flow projections and higher cost-of-capital discount rates.
Based on this testing, step two testing for possible impairment was required for the Company’s U.S. Printing Papers business and its U.S. Coated Paperboard business. Based on management’s preliminary estimates, an additional goodwill
impairment charge of $379 million was recorded, representing all of the goodwill for the U.S. Coated Paperboard business, as this was management’s best estimate of the minimum impairment charge that would be required upon the completion of
detailed step two analyses. In
Febru-

ary 2009, based on additional work performed to date, management determined that it was probable that all of the $1.3 billion of recorded goodwill for the U.S. Printing Papers business would be
impaired when testing was completed. Accordingly, an additional goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 billion was recorded as a charge to operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company
finalized the testing for these businesses resulting in no changes to the recorded impairment charges.

No goodwill impairment charges
were recorded in 2010 or 2009.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Accounting

The calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can
significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities, the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend
rates.

Benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2010, for International Paper’s pension and
postretirement plans were as follows:

The table below shows assumptions used by International Paper to calculate U.S. pension expenses for the years shown:

%

%

Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to

5.00

%

5.00

%

Year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain





International Paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on
December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current
and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio. The discount rate assumption was determined based on a yield curve that incorporates approximately 500 Aa-graded bonds. The plan’s projected cash flows were then matched to the
yield curve to develop the discount rate.

Increasing (decreasing) the expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets by an
additional 0.25% would decrease (increase) 2011 pension expense by approximately $22 million, while a (decrease) increase of 0.25% in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately $29 million. The effect on net
postretirement benefit cost from a 1% increase or decrease in the annual trend rate would be approximately $1 million.

Actual rates of
return earned on U.S. pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were:

The
annualized time-weighted rate of return earned on U.S. pension plan assets was 6.5% and 7.2% for the past five and ten years, respectively. The following graph shows the growth of a $1,000 investment in International Paper’s U.S. Pension Plan
Master Trust. The graph portrays the time-weighted rate of return from 2000-2010.

ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and
losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation

due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. These net gains and losses are recognized in pension
expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans (approximately nine years) to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in
subsequent years. The estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the U.S. pension plans over the next fiscal year are $204 million and $31 million,
respectively.

Net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses, calculated for all of International Paper’s plans, were as
follows:

The increase in 2010 U.S. pension expense principally reflects a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 5.80% in 2010 from 6.00% in 2009 and
higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses.

Assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates
of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2010, projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows:

(a)

Based on assumptions at December 31, 2010.



The Company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately $179 million for its
U.S. defined benefit plans in 2011, with the decrease from expense of $231 million in 2010 reflecting increased plan assets in 2011 as a result of a $1.15 billion voluntary contribution and higher than expected asset returns in 2010, partially
offset by a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 5.60% in 2011 from 5.80% in 2010. Net postretirement benefit costs in 2011 are projected to increase primarily as a result of a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 5.30% in 2011 from 5.40% in
2010, partially offset by a decrease in per capita healthcare costs due to changes in plan provisions.

The market value of plan assets
for International Paper’s U.S. qualified pension plan at December 31, 2010 totaled approximately $8.3 billion, consisting of approximately 49% equity securities, 31% debt securities, and 20% real estate and other assets. Plan assets
include an immaterial amount of International Paper common stock.

The Company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is
to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the Company,
and other factors. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future. The nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit
payments, which totaled $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Accounting for Stock Options

International Paper follows ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” in accounting for stock options. Under this guidance,
expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grant-date fair market value.

During each reporting
period, diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “in-the-money” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace. When options are actually exercised, option proceeds are
credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share, with no effect on reported earnings. Equity is also increased by the tax benefit that International Paper will receive in its tax return for income
reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 18.2 million options and 22.2 million options,
respectively, were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from $32.54 to $43.12 per share for 2010 and $29.31 to $66.69 per share for 2009.

Income Taxes

The Company’s effective income tax rates, before equity earnings and discontinued operations, were 27%, 39%
and (14)% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year, but may not recur in subsequent years.
Management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years. Excluding
these special items, the effective income tax rate for 2010 was 30% of pre-tax earnings compared with 30% in 2009 and 31.5% in 2008. The higher rate in 2008 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. We estimate that
the 2011 effective income tax rate will be approximately 32-34% based on expected earnings and business conditions.

RECENT
ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

The following represent recently issued accounting pronouncements that will affect reporting and
disclosures in future periods.

Revenue Arrangements With Multiple Deliverables

In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable
Revenue Arrangements,” which amends the multiple-element arrangement guidance under ASC 605, “Revenue Recognition.” This guidance amends the criteria for separating consideration for products or services in multiple-deliverable
arrangements. This guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, eliminates the residual method of allocation, and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the
arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. In addition, this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This guidance is effective
prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or



after June 15, 2010 (calendar year 2011). The application of the requirements of this guidance will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Variable Interest Entities

In June
2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-17, “Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities,” which amends the consolidation guidance that applies to variable interest entities under ASC 810,
“Consolidations.” This guidance changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. This guidance was effective for financial
statements issued in fiscal years (and interim periods) beginning after November 15, 2009 (calendar year 2010). The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2010 and it did not have an effect on the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

Subsequent Events

In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC 855, “Subsequent Events,” which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
statements are issued or are available to be issued. This guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company included the requirements of this guidance in the preparation of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Asset Transfers, Variable Interest Entities and Qualifying Special Purpose Entities

In December 2008, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC 860, “Transfers and Servicing” which requires public
companies to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets and an enterprise’s involvement with variable interest entities, including qualifying special purpose entities. The Company included the requirements of this
guidance in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

In March 2008, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” that requires qualitative
disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures

about fair value amounts of, and gains and losses on, derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. This guidance was effective
for fiscal years (and interim periods) beginning after November 15, 2008 (calendar year 2009). The Company included the disclosures required by this guidance in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Business Combinations

In December
2007, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes and measures the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to
evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. This guidance was effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period
beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (calendar year 2009). The Company included the provisions of this guidance in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

In December 2008, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” to require more detailed
disclosures about employers’ plan assets, including employers’ investment strategies, major categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. The
disclosures required by this guidance must be provided in financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009 (calendar year 2009). The Company included the provisions of this guidance in the preparation of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” which provides a single definition of fair value, together with a framework for measuring it, and
requires additional disclosure about the use of



fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the
highest level being quoted prices in active markets.

In February 2008, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC 820 which delayed the
effective date for fair value measurement and disclosure for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 (calendar year 2009). The Company partially
adopted the provisions of this guidance with respect to its financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value effective January 1, 2008 (see Note 13). The Company included the remaining provisions of this guidance in the
preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

In October 2008, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC 820 which
clarifies the application of fair value measurement and disclosure in cases where the market for the asset is not active. This guidance was effective upon issuance. The Company considered the guidance in the preparation of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued additional guidance under ASC 820 which provides guidance on
estimating the fair value of an asset or liability (financial or nonfinancial) when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased, and on identifying transactions that are not orderly. The application of
the requirements of this guidance did not have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

In August 2009,
the FASB issued ASU 2009-05, “Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value,” which further amends ASC 820 by providing clarification for circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available. The
Company included the disclosures required by this guidance in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

In January 2010, the
FASB issued ASU 2010-06, “Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.” which further amends ASC 820 to add new disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances,
and settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. This new guidance also clarifies the level of disaggregation, inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and amends

guidance under ASC 715 related to employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets to require that disclosures be provided by classes of assets instead of by major categories
of assets. This guidance was effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a
gross basis, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company included the disclosures required by this guidance in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of the remaining requirements of this guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

International Paper has been named as a
potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Most of these proceedings involve the cleanup of
hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources. While joint and several liability is authorized under CERCLA and equivalent state laws, as a practical matter, liability for CERCLA cleanups is
typically allocated among the many potential responsible parties. Based upon previous experience with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances using presently available information, International Paper believes that its liability is not likely
to be significant at 54 such sites, and that its liability at 45 other sites is likely to be significant but not material to International Paper’s consolidated financial statements. Remedial costs are recorded in the financial statements when
they become probable and reasonably estimable. International Paper believes that the probable liability associated with these 99 matters is approximately $76 million.

One of the sites referred to above is a closed wood treating facility located in Cass Lake, Minnesota. During 2009, in connection with an environmental site remediation action under CERCLA, we submitted to the EPA
a site remediation feasibility study. In November 2010, the EPA provided comments that limited the number of acceptable remedial action alternatives that the Company may be allowed to pursue and adopted more restrictive clean up requirements for the
site. As a result, the Company



increased its remediation reserve for this site from $6 million to $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The final remediation plan for this site has not been approved by the EPA, and of the
five alternatives, the Company’s reserve reflects the low end of the range of estimated remediation costs, since, at this time, no one of the alternatives proposed by the EPA is any more likely than the others to be approved. If the most
expensive of the clean-up alternatives were approved by the EPA, the remediation costs could be material, and significantly higher than amounts currently recorded.

In addition to the above proceedings, other remediation costs, typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the Company’s current, closed or formerly-owned facilities, and recorded as
liabilities in the balance sheet, totaled approximately $48 million. Other than as described above, completion of required remedial actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Other Legal Matters

The Company is
also involved in various other inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation relating to environmental and safety matters, contracts, sales of property, intellectual property, personal injury, labor and employment, and other matters, some of
which allege substantial monetary damages. While any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty, the Company believes that the outcome of any of the lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened or all of them combined (other than
those that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature), will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.

EFFECT OF INFLATION

While inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as energy, wood fiber and chemical costs, have an
impact on the Company’s operating results, changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years. Sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand
factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS

International Paper has operations in a number of countries. Its operations in those countries also export to, and compete with,
imports from other

regions. As such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s financial statements. Direct impacts include the translation of international
operations’ local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars. Indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the United States (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are
traded internationally). In general, a lower U.S. dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to International Paper. The currencies that have the most impact are the Euro, the Brazilian real, the Polish zloty and the Russian ruble.

MARKET RISK

We
use financial instruments, including fixed and variable rate debt, to finance operations, for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, financial instruments, including various derivative contracts, are used to
hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and foreign currency risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. Information related to International Paper’s debt obligations is included in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.

The fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency
rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments. We assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a
hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and currency rates and commodity prices.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short- and long-term debt obligations and investments in marketable
securities. We invest in investment-grade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AAA and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund. Our investments in marketable securities at December 31,
2010 are stated at cost, which approximates market due to their short-term nature. Our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material.



We issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with International Paper’s
targeted capital structure, while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate. Derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, may be used to implement this capital structure. At
December 31, 2010 and 2009, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $8.5 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse
shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately $373 million and $394 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Commodity Price Risk

The objective
of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. Commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy
prices. The net fair value liability of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $29 million and $26 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse change in
the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately $7 million and $20 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Foreign Currency Risk

International Paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries. Our objective in managing the
associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our after-tax cash flows. We address these risks on a limited basis by financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings
denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency, or by entering into cross-currency and interest rate swaps, or foreign exchange contracts. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the net fair value asset of financial
instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately $13 million and $32 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would
have been approximately $37 million and $73 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.



ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON:

Financial Statements

The management of International Paper Company is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in this annual report and
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America considered appropriate in
the circumstances to present fairly the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows on a consistent basis. Management has also prepared the other information in this annual report and is responsible for its
accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

As can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment,
some financial statement amounts are based on estimates and judgments. Even though estimates and judgments are used, measures have been taken to provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial information contained in
this annual report. We have formed a Disclosure Committee to oversee this process.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP. During its audits, Deloitte & Touche LLP was given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of
all meetings of stockholders and the board of directors and all committees of the board. Management believes that all representations made to the independent auditors during their audits were valid and appropriate.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of International Paper Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. Internal controls over financial reporting is the process
designed by, or under the supervision, of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes. All internal control

systems have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control
objectives. The Company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures, contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and is audited by the internal audit function. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct
deficiencies as they are identified.

The Company has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, it used the criteria described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2010, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The company completed the acquisition of SCA Packaging Asia in July, 2010. Due to the timing of the acquisition we have excluded SCA Packaging Asia from our evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. For the period ended December 31, 2010, SCA Packaging Asia net sales and assets represented approximately 1% of net sales and 1% of total assets.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The
report appears on page 51.

Internal Control Environment And Board Of Directors Oversight

Our internal control environment includes an enterprise-wide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone
at the top.” This is exemplified by our ethics program that includes long-standing principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of International
Paper business, which have been distributed to all employees; a toll-free telephone helpline whereby any employee may anonymously report suspected violations of law or International Paper’s policy; and an office of ethics and business practice.
The internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel, appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility, dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout
International Paper, and an extensive program of internal audits with management follow-up.



The Board of Directors, assisted by the Audit and Finance Committee (Committee), monitors the
integrity of the Company’s financial statements and financial reporting procedures, the performance of the Company’s internal audit function and independent auditors, and other matters set forth in its charter. The Committee, which
currently consists of five independent directors, meets regularly with representatives of management, and with the independent auditors and the Internal Auditor, with and without management representatives in attendance, to review their activities.
The Committee’s Charter takes into account the New York Stock Exchange rules relating to Audit Committees and the SEC rules and regulations promulgated as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010, including critical accounting policies and significant management judgments, with management and the independent auditors. The Committee’s report recommending the
inclusion of such financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will be set forth in our Proxy Statement.

REPORT OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

To the Shareholders of International Paper Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of International Paper Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of International Paper Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Shareholders of International Paper Company:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of International Paper Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in the Report of Management on Internal Controls Over
Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of the SCA Packaging Asia business which was acquired on June 30, 2010 whose financial statements constitute approximately 1% of total net
sales and 1% of total assets of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting of the SCA Packaging Asia business. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management
on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of

directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 of the Company, and our report dated February 25, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF BUSINESS

International Paper (the Company) is a global paper and packaging company
that is complemented by an extensive North American merchant distribution system, with primary markets and manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Russia, Asia and North Africa. Substantially all of our businesses have
experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to available industry capacity and general economic conditions.

FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States that require the use of management’s estimates. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates.

CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of International Paper and its wholly-owned, controlled majority-owned and financially controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.

International Paper accounts for its investment in Ilim Holding S.A. (Ilim), a separate reportable industry segment, using the equity method of
accounting. Due to the complex organizational structure of Ilim’s operations, and the extended time required to prepare consolidated financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the
Company reports its share of Ilim’s operating results on a one-quarter lag basis.

Investments in affiliated companies where the
Company has significant influence over their operations are accounted for by the equity method. International Paper’s share of affiliates’ earnings totaled earnings of $64 million, a loss of $49 million and earnings of $49 million in 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue is recognized when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for

terms designated f.o.b. (free on board) shipping point. For sales transactions designated f.o.b. destination, revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer’s delivery
site, when title and risk of loss are transferred. Timber and forestland sales revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the buyer.

ALTERNATIVE FUEL MIXTURE CREDITS – COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD

The U.S. Internal Revenue Code
provided a tax credit for companies that use alternative fuel mixtures to produce energy to operate their businesses. As these credits represent a reduction of energy costs at the Company’s U.S. manufacturing facilities, the credits are
included as a reduction of Cost of products sold in 2009 in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. See Alternative Fuel Mixture Credits in Note 4 for a further discussion of these credits.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

Shipping and
handling costs, such as freight to our customers’ destinations, are included in distribution expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. When shipping and handling costs are included in the sales price charged for our products, they
are recognized in net sales.

ANNUAL MAINTENANCE COSTS

Costs for repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the month that the related activity is performed under the direct expense method of accounting.

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS

Temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less
are treated as cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which approximates market.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor and
manufacturing overhead. In the United States, costs of raw materials and finished pulp and paper products are generally determined using the last-in, first-out method. Other inventories are valued using the first-in, first-out or average cost
methods.



PLANTS, PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT

Plants, properties and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for betterments are capitalized, whereas normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The
units-of-production method of depreciation is used for major pulp and paper mills, and the straight-line method is used for other plants and equipment. Annual straight-line depreciation rates are, for buildings – 2 1/2% to 8 1/2%, and for
machinery and equipment – 5% to 33%.

FORESTLANDS

At December 31, 2010, International Paper and its subsidiaries owned or managed approximately 250,000 acres of forestlands in Brazil, and through licenses and forest management agreements, had harvesting
rights on government-owned forestlands in Russia. Costs attributable to timber are charged against income as trees are cut. The rate charged is determined annually based on the relationship of incurred costs to estimated current merchantable volume.

GOODWILL

Goodwill relating to
a single business reporting unit is included as an asset of the applicable segment, while goodwill arising from major acquisitions that involve multiple business segments is classified as a corporate asset for segment reporting purposes. For
goodwill impairment testing, this goodwill is allocated to reporting units. Annual testing for possible goodwill impairment is performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, with additional interim testing performed when
management believes that it is more likely than not events or circumstances have occurred that would result in the impairment of a reporting unit’s goodwill.

In performing this testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the
unit’s assets, discounted using the estimated cost of capital for each reporting unit. These estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to historic market transactions for businesses in the industry, and by
comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the Company’s traded stock price on the testing date. For reporting units whose recorded value of net
assets plus goodwill is in excess of their estimated fair

values, the fair values of the individual assets and liabilities of the respective reporting units are then determined to calculate the amount of any goodwill impairment charge required (see Note
8).

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, measured by comparing their net
book value to the undiscounted projected future cash flows generated by their use. Impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value (see Note 6).

INCOME TAXES

International Paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate changes are enacted.

International Paper records its worldwide tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in
which it operates. Where the Company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the
Company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and the facts of each matter. Changes to recorded liabilities are made only when an
identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, a change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter.

While the judgments and estimates made by the Company are based on management’s evaluation of the technical merits of a matter,
assisted as necessary by consultation with outside consultants, historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances, actual resolution



of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts, resulting in charges or credits that could materially affect future financial statements.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Compensation
costs resulting from all stock-based compensation transactions are measured and recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. In addition, liability awards are
remeasured each reporting period. Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award.

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS

Costs
associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for
environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value when the amount and timing of expected cash payments are reliably determinable.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

A liability and an asset are recorded equal to the present value
of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of long-lived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The liability is accreted over time and the asset is depreciated over the life
of the related equipment or facility. International Paper's asset retirement obligations principally relate to closure costs for landfills. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated costs or timing of closures, or
possible new federal or state regulations affecting these closures.

In connection with potential future closures or redesigns of
certain production facilities, it is possible that the Company may be required to take steps to remove certain materials from these facilities. Applicable regulations and standards provide that the removal of certain materials would only be required
if the facility were to be demolished or underwent major renovations. At this time, any such obligations have an indeterminate settlement date, and the Company believes that adequate information does not exist to apply an expected-present-value
technique to estimate any such potential obligations. Accordingly, the Company does not record a liability

for such remediation until a decision is made that allows reasonable estimation of the timing of such remediation.

TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Balance sheets of international operations are translated
into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, while statements of operations are translated at average rates. Adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as cumulative translation adjustments in Accumulated other
comprehensive loss.

NOTE 2 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

In September 2009, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements,” which amends the multiple-element arrangement guidance under ASC 605, “Revenue Recognition.” This guidance
amends the criteria for separating consideration for products or services in multiple-deliverable arrangements. This guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, eliminates the residual method of
allocation, and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. In addition, this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a
vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 (calendar year 2011). The
application of the requirements of this guidance will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

VARIABLE INTEREST
ENTITIES

In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-17, “Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable
Interest Entities,” which amends the consolidation guidance that applies to variable interest entities under ASC 810, “Consolidations.” This guidance changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized
or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. This guidance was effective for financial statements



issued in fiscal years (and interim periods) beginning after November 15, 2009 (calendar year 2010). The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2010 and it did not have an effect
on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC 855, “Subsequent Events,” which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events
that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company included the
requirements of this guidance in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

ASSET TRANSFERS, VARIABLE INTEREST ENITITES
AND QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES

In December 2008, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC 860, “Transfers and
Servicing,” which requires public companies to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets and an enterprise’s involvement with variable interest entities, including qualifying special purpose entities. The Company
included the requirements of this guidance in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND
HEDGING ACTIVITIES

In March 2008, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” that requires
qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of, and gains and losses on, derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in
derivative agreements. This guidance was effective for fiscal years (and interim periods) beginning after November 15, 2008 (calendar year 2009). The Company included the disclosures required by this guidance in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes and
measures the assets acquired and

liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to
disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. This guidance was effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition
date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (calendar year 2009). The Company included the provisions of this guidance in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

EMPLOYERS’ ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

In December 2008, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” to require more detailed
disclosures about employers’ plan assets, including employers’ investment strategies, major categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. The
disclosures required by this guidance must be provided in financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009 (calendar year 2009). The Company included the provisions of this guidance in the preparation of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” which provides a single definition of fair value, together with a framework for measuring it, and
requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest
level being quoted prices in active markets.

In February 2008, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC 820 which delayed the effective
date for fair value measurement and disclosure for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 (calendar year 2009). The Company partially adopted the
provisions of this guidance with respect to its financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value effective January 1, 2008 (see Note 13). The Company included the remaining provisions of this guidance in the preparation of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.



In October 2008, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC 820 which clarifies the application of fair
value measurement and disclosure in cases where the market for the asset is not active. This guidance was effective upon issuance. The Company considered the guidance in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued additional guidance under ASC 820 which provides guidance on estimating the fair value of an asset or
liability (financial or nonfinancial) when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased, and on identifying transactions that are not orderly. The application of the requirements of this guidance did not
have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-05,
“Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value,” which further amends ASC 820 by providing clarification for circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available. The Company included the disclosures
required by this guidance in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06,
“Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements,” which further amends ASC 820 to add new disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements relating
to Level 3 measurements. This new guidance also clarifies the level of disaggregation, inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and amends guidance under ASC 715 related to employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit
plan assets to require that disclosures be provided by classes of assets instead of by major categories of assets. This guidance was effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2009, except
for the requirement to provide Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The
Company included the disclosures required by this guidance in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of the remaining requirements of this guidance will have a material effect on its
consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

Basic earnings per common share from continuing operations are computed by dividing earnings from continuing operations by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations are computed assuming that all potentially dilutive securities, including “in-the-money” stock options, were converted into common shares at
the beginning of each year. In addition, the computation of diluted earnings per share reflects the inclusion of contingently convertible securities in periods when dilutive.

A reconciliation of the amounts included in the computation of basic earnings per common share from continuing operations, and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations is as follows:

(a)

Securities are not included in the table in periods when antidilutive.

(b)

Options to purchase 18.2 million, 22.2 million and 25.1 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted common shares outstanding because their exercise price exceeded the average market price of the Company’s common stock for each respective reporting date.

NOTE 4 RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER ITEMS

Alternative
Fuel Mixture Credits

The U.S. Internal Revenue Code provided a tax credit for companies that use alternative fuel mixtures to
produce energy to operate their businesses. The credit, equal to $0.50 per gallon of alternative fuel contained in the mixture, is refundable to the taxpayer. In January 2009, the Company received notification that its application to be registered
as an alternative fuel mixer had been approved. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company filed claims for alternative fuel mixture credits covering eligible periods subsequent to November 2008 through October 25, 2009 totaling
approximately $1.7 billion, all of which had been received in cash at December 31, 2009. Additionally, the Company had recorded $379 million of alternative fuel mixture credits as a reduction of income taxes payable at December 31, 2009.
Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated statement of operations includes credits of approximately $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 in Cost of products sold ($1.4 billion after taxes), representing eligible alternative fuel
mixture credits earned through December 31, 2009, when the credit expired.

Cellulosic Bio-fuel Tax Credit

In a memorandum dated June 28, 2010, the IRS concluded that black liquor would also qualify for the cellulosic bio-fuel tax credit of $1.01
per gallon produced in 2009. On October 15, 2010, the IRS ruled that companies may qualify in the same year for the $0.50 per gallon alternative fuel mixture credit and the $1.01 cellulosic bio-fuel tax credit for 2009, but not for the same
gallons. To the extent a taxpayer changes their position and uses the $1.01 credit, they must re-pay the refunds they received as alternative fuel mixture credits attributable to the gallons converted to the cellulosic bio-fuel credit. The repayment
of this refund must include interest.

One important difference between the two credits is that the $1.01 credit must be credited against a
company's Federal taxable earnings, and the credit may be carried forward against taxable earnings through 2015. In contrast, the $0.50 credit is refundable in cash. The cellulosic bio-fuel credit is required to be included in Federal taxable
income.

The Company filed an application with the IRS on November 18, 2010, to receive the required registration code to become a
registered cellulosic bio-fuel producer. At present, the Company has not received this registration code; however, the Company believes approval of the application for the registration code to be ministerial in nature.

The Company has evaluated the optimal use of the two credits with respect to gallons produced in 2009. Considerations include uncertainty around
future federal taxable income, the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture credit, future liquidity and uses of cash such as but not limited to debt re-payments and voluntary pension contributions versus repayment of alternative fuel mixture
credits with interest. At the present time, the Company does not intend to convert any gallons under the alternative fuel mixture credit to gallons under the cellulosic bio-fuel credit. The Company will continue evaluating its position with regard
to the previously claimed alternative fuel mixture credit gallons produced in 2009. This continued evaluation may result in the Company repaying some or all of the cash received with respect to the $0.50 credit, and amendment of the Company’s
2009 tax return.

During 2009, the Company did produce 64 million gallons of black liquor that were not eligible for the
alternative fuel mixture credit. The Company does intend to claim these gallons for the cellulosic bio-fuel credit by amending the Company’s 2009 tax return. The impact of this amendment, which has been included in the Company’s 2010
Income tax provision (benefit), is a $40 million net credit to tax expense.

As is the case with other tax credits, taxpayer claims are
subject to possible future review by the IRS which has the authority to propose adjustments to the amounts claimed, or credits received.

NOTE 5 ACQUISITIONS

2010:

On June 30, 2010, International Paper completed the acquisition of SCA Packaging Asia (SCA) for a preliminary purchase price of
$205 million, including $171 million in cash plus assumed debt of



$34 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. The SCA packaging business in Asia consists of 13 corrugated box plants and two specialty packaging facilities, which are primarily in China,
along with locations in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.

The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase
price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.

The purchase price allocation will be finalized in the first half of 2011.

The identifiable
intangible assets acquired in connection with the SCA acquisition included the following:

2008:

On August 4, 2008,
International Paper completed the acquisition of the assets of Weyerhaeuser Company’s Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling (CBPR) business for approximately $6 billion in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments. In June 2008, the Company
had issued $3 billion of unsecured senior notes in anticipation of the acquisition. The remainder of the purchase price was financed through borrowings under a $2.5 billion bank term loan, $0.4 billion of borrowings under a receivables
securitization program and existing cash

balances. The CBPR operating results are included in International Paper’s North American Industrial Packaging business from the date of acquisition.

The following table summarizes the final allocation of the purchase price, plus direct acquisition costs, to the fair value of assets and
liabilities acquired.

The identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the CBPR acquisition included the following:

In connection with the purchase price
allocation, inventories were written up by approximately $39 million before taxes ($24 million after taxes) to their estimated fair value. As the related inventories were sold during the 2008 third quarter, this amount was included in Cost of
products sold for the quarter.

Additionally, Selling and administrative expenses for the years ended 2009 and 2008 included $87 million
in charges before taxes ($54 million after taxes) and $45 million in charges before taxes ($28 million after taxes), respectively, for integration costs associated with the acquisition.

The following unaudited pro forma information for the year ended December 31, 2008 represents the results of operations of International Paper
as if the



CBPR acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2008. This pro forma information does not purport to represent International Paper’s actual results of operations if the transaction
described above would have occurred on January 1, 2008, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results. Pro forma information related to the acquisition of SCA Packaging Asia has not been included as it does not have a material effect on
the Company’s consolidated results of operations.

sales.

OTHER DIVESTITURES AND IMPAIRMENTS

2010:

During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $25 million ($15 million after taxes) as a result of the

partial redemption of the 10% interest the Company retained in its Arizona Chemical business after the sale of the business in 2006. The Company received $37 million in cash from the redemption
of this interest.

Also, during the three months ended December 31, 2010, a $2 million charge, before and after taxes, was recorded
to further write down the long-lived assets of the Company’s Inverurie, Scotland mill, which was closed in March 2009.

The net
2010 gain totaling $23 million discussed above is included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

2009:

During the three months ended June 30, 2009, based on a current strategic plan update of projected future operating results of
the Company’s Etienne mill in France, a determination was made that the current book value of the mill’s long-lived assets exceeded their estimated fair value, calculated using the probability-weighted present value of projected future
cash flows. As a result, a $48 million charge, before and after taxes, was recorded in the Company’s Industrial Packaging industry segment to write down the long-lived assets of the mill to their estimated fair value.

During the three months ended December 31, 2009, an $8 million charge, before and after taxes, was recorded in the Company’s Industrial
Packaging segment related to the Company’s Etienne mill in France, which was closed at the end of November 2009. In addition, a pre-tax charge of $3 million ($0 million after taxes) was recorded for other items, of which $2 million, before and
after taxes, was recorded in the Industrial Packaging segment.

The net 2009 losses totaling $59 million discussed above are included in
Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

2008:

During
the three months ended September 30, 2008, based on a current strategic plan update of projected future operating results of the Company’s Inverurie, Scotland mill, a determination was made that the current book value of the mill’s
long-lived assets exceeded their estimated fair value, calculated using the probability-weighted present value of projected future cash flows. As a result, a $107 million pre-tax charge ($84 million after taxes) was recorded in the Company’s
Printing Papers industry segment to write down the long-lived assets



of the mill to their estimated fair value. In February 2009, a decision was made to close the mill by the end of March 2009.

During the three months ended March 31, 2008, a $1 million credit, before and after taxes, was recorded to adjust previously estimated
gains/losses of businesses previously sold.

The net 2008 pre-tax losses totaling $106 million discussed above are included in Net
(gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

NOTE 7 SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE

Accounts and notes receivable, net of allowances, by
classification were:

The last-in, first-out inventory method is used to value most of International Paper’s U.S. inventories. Approximately 69% of total raw
materials and finished products inventories were valued using this method. If the first-in, first-out method had been used, it would have increased total inventory balances by approximately $334 million and $306 million at December 31, 2010 and
2009, respectively.

PLANTS, PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT

Plants, properties and equipment by major classification were:

Depreciation expense was $1.4 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and $1.3 billion for the year ended

taxes), after expenses. Cash of $160 million was received at closing, with the balance of $39 million, plus interest, to be received no later than three years from closing. In addition, the Company has received a 20% profits interest in the
Partnership. The gain on this sale is included in Cost of products sold in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.



NOTE 8 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

GOODWILL

The following tables present changes in the goodwill balances as allocated to each
business segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:

(b)

Represents the effects of foreign currency translations and reclassifications.

(c)

Represents the preliminary purchase price allocation related to the acquisition of SCA Packaging Asia.

(d)

(d)

Reflects a reduction from tax benefits generated by the deduction of goodwill amortization for tax purposes in Brazil.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, in conjunction with annual testing of its reporting
units for possible goodwill impairments as of the beginning of the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a $59 million charge to write off all recorded goodwill of its European Coated Paperboard business. Subsequent to this testing date, the
Company’s market capitalization declined through December 31, 2008. The Company determined that this decline, and the deterioration during the fourth quarter in economic conditions, represented indicators that required interim testing at
year end for possible additional goodwill impairment. As a result, the Company performed an interim test as of December 31, 2008 and recalculated the estimated fair value of its reporting units as of that date using updated future cash flow
projections and higher cost-of-capital discount rate assumptions, which resulted in the goodwill for two additional business units, the Company’s U.S. Printing Papers business and its U.S. Coated Paperboard business, being potentially impaired.
Based on management’s preliminary estimates, an additional goodwill impairment charge of $379 million was recorded, representing all of the goodwill for the U.S. Coated Paperboard business, as this was management’s best estimate of the
minimum impairment charge that would be required upon the completion of a detailed allocation of the business unit fair values to the individual assets and liabilities of each of the respective reporting units. In February 2009, based on additional
work performed to date, management determined that it was probable that all of the $1.3 billion of recorded goodwill for the U.S. Printing Papers business would be impaired when testing was completed. Accordingly, an additional goodwill impairment
charge of $1.3 billion was recorded as a charge to operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company finalized the testing for these businesses resulting in no changes to the recorded
impairment charges.

No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2010 or 2009.



OTHER INTANGIBLES

The net carrying amount of identifiable intangible assets (such as trade names, customer lists, patented technology, etc.), excluding goodwill, was as follows:

NOTE 9 INCOME TAXES

The components of International Paper’s earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings by taxing jurisdiction
were:

The
provision (benefit) for income taxes by taxing jurisdiction was:

The Company’s deferred income tax provision (benefit) includes a $0 million provision, a $1 million provision and a $14 million provision for
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for the effect of changes in non-U.S. and U.S. state tax rates.

International Paper made income tax payments, net of refunds, of $(135) million, $97 million and $131
million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

A reconciliation of income tax expense using the statutory U.S. income tax rate compared
with actual income tax provision follows:

The
tax effects of significant temporary differences, representing deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010 and 2009, were as follows:



Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under
the captions Deferred income tax assets, Deferred charges and other assets, Other accrued liabilities and Deferred income taxes. The decrease in 2010 in deferred tax assets principally relates to the tax impact of changes in recorded qualified
pension liabilities. The increase in deferred income tax liabilities principally relates to more tax depreciation taken on the Company’s assets purchased in 2010.

The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2010, was an increase of $20 million which consists primarily of an allowance applied to state tax credits generated in the
current year.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,
2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows:

Included in the balance at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are $13 million, $56 million and $9 million, respectively, for tax positions for
which the ultimate benefits are highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such benefits. However, except for the possible effect of any penalties, any disallowance that would change the timing of these benefits would not
affect the annual effective tax rate, but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.

The
Company accrues interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The Company had approximately $100 million and $95 million accrued for the payment
of estimated interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The
major jurisdictions where the Company files income tax returns are the United States, Brazil, France, Poland and Russia. Generally, tax years 2002 through 2010 remain open and subject to
examina-

tion by the relevant tax authorities. The Company is typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time, both in the United States and overseas. Currently, the Company is engaged in
discussions with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service regarding the examination of tax years 2006 and 2007. As a result of these discussions, other pending tax audit settlements, and the expiration of statutes of limitation, the Company currently
estimates that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to $75 million during the next twelve months. During 2010, unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $109 million. While the Company believes that it is adequately accrued
for possible audit adjustments, the final resolution of these examinations cannot be determined at this time and could result in final settlements that differ from current estimates. Included in the Company’s 2010, 2009 and 2008 income tax
provisions are $(143) million, $279 million and $(207) million, respectively, related to special items. The components of the net provisions related to special items were as follows:

Excluding the impact of special items, the 2010, 2009 and 2008 tax provisions were $364 million, $190 million and $369 million, respectively, or
30%, 30% and 31.5%, respectively, of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.



The following details the scheduled expiration dates of the Company’s net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards:

Deferred income taxes are not provided for temporary differences of approximately $4.3 billion, $3.5 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, representing earnings of
non-U.S. subsidiaries intended to be permanently reinvested. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and other basis differences is not practicable.

NOTE 10 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Certain property, machinery and equipment are leased under cancelable and non-cancelable agreements.

Unconditional purchase obligations have been entered into in the ordinary course of business, principally for capital projects and the purchase of
certain pulpwood, logs, wood chips, raw materials, energy and services, including fiber supply agreements to purchase pulpwood that were entered into concurrently with the Company’s 2006 Transformation Plan forestland sales.

At December 31, 2010, total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operating leases and purchase obligations were as
follows:

Rent expense was $210 million, $216 million and $205 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

In connection with sales of businesses, property, equipment, forestlands and other assets, International Paper commonly makes
representations and warranties relating to such businesses or assets, and may agree to indemnify buyers with respect to tax and environmental liabilities, breaches of representations and warranties, and other matters. Where liabilities for such
matters are determined to be probable and subject to reasonable estimation, accrued liabilities are recorded at the time of sale as a cost of the transaction.

In May 2008, a recovery boiler at the Company’s Vicksburg, Mississippi facility exploded, resulting in one fatality and injuries to employees of contractors working on the site. The Company has resolved all of
the eight original lawsuits arising from this matter. However, a new matter was filed January 4, 2011. Nevertheless, the Company believes it has adequate insurance to resolve any remaining matters, and the settlement of these lawsuits
will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.

International Paper has been named as a potentially
responsible party in various environmental remediation actions (See Legal Proceedings on page 45). During 2009, in connection with an environmental site remediation action under CERCLA, International Paper submitted to the EPA a feasibility study
for a closed wood treating facility located in Cass Lake, Minnesota. In November 2010 the EPA provided comments that required International Paper to narrow the remedial action alternatives identified in the study. As a result of this recent
information, the Company increased its remediation reserve for this site from $6 million to $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The final remediation plan for this site has not been approved by the EPA, and of the five alternatives, the
Company’s reserve reflects the low end of the range of estimated remediation costs, since, at this time, no one of the alternatives proposed by the EPA is any more likely than the others to be approved. If the most expensive of the clean-up
alternatives were approved by the EPA, the remediation costs could be material, and significantly higher than amounts currently recorded.

In June 2010, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) finalized its previously proposed consent order to the
Company with a civil penalty of $115,000. The penalty was levied for self-disclosed failures by the Company’s Georgetown, South Carolina mill to operate



within carbon monoxide and total reduced sulfur emission limits under the mill’s Part 70 (Title V) Air Quality Operating Permit.

SUMMARY

The Company is also involved in various other inquiries, administrative proceedings
and litigation relating to environmental and safety matters, contracts, sales of property, intellectual property, personal injury, labor and employment, and other matters, some of which allege substantial monetary damages. While any proceeding or
litigation has the element of uncertainty, the Company believes that the outcome of any of the lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened or all of them combined (other than those that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature), will
not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 11 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARIES

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

In connection
with the 2006 sale of approximately 5.6 million acres of forestlands, International Paper received installment notes (the Timber Notes) totaling approximately $4.8 billion. The Timber Notes, which do not require principal payments prior to
their August 2016 maturity, are supported by irrevocable letters of credit obtained by the buyers of the forestlands. During the three months ended December 31, 2006, International Paper contributed the Timber Notes to newly formed entities
(the Borrower Entities) in exchange for Class A and Class B interests in these entities. Subsequently, International Paper contributed its $200 million Class A interests in the Borrower Entities, along with approximately $400 million of
International Paper promissory notes, to other newly formed entities (the Investor Entities, and together with the Borrower Entities, the Entities) in exchange for Class A and Class B interests in these entities, and simultaneously sold its
Class A interest in the Investor Entities to a third party investor. As a result, at December 31, 2006, International Paper held Class B interests in the Borrower Entities and Class B interests in the Investor entities valued at
approximately $5.0 billion. International Paper has no obligation to make any further capital contributions to these Entities and did not provide any financial support that was not previously contractually required for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.

Also during 2006, the Entities acquired approximately $4.8 billion of International Paper debt
obligations for cash, resulting in a total of approximately $5.2 billion of International Paper debt obligations held by the Entities at December 31, 2006. The various agreements entered into in connection with these transactions provide that
International Paper has, and intends to affect, a legal right to offset its obligation under these debt instruments with its investments in the Entities. Accordingly, for financial reporting purposes, International Paper has offset approximately
$5.1 billion of Class B interests in the entities against $5.1 billion of International Paper debt obligations held by these Entities at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Remaining borrowings of $129 million and $144 million for 2010 and 2009,
respectively, are included in floating rate notes due 2011 – 2016 in the summary of long-term debt in Note 12. Additional debt related to the above transaction of $38 million and $46 million is included in short-term notes in the summary of
long-term debt in Note 12 for 2010 and 2009, respectively.

International Paper also holds variable interests in two financing entities
that were used to monetize long-term notes received from the sale of forestlands in 2001 and 2002. International Paper transferred notes (the Monetized Notes, with an original maturity of 10 years from inception) and cash having a value of
approximately $1.0 billion to these entities in exchange for preferred interests, and accounted for the transfers as a sale of the notes with no associated gain or loss. In the same period, the entities acquired approximately $1.0 billion of
International Paper debt obligations for cash. International Paper has no obligation to make any further capital contributions to these entities and did not provide any financial support that was not previously contractually required during the
years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008. At December 31, 2010, International Paper’s $542 million preferred interest in one of the entities has been offset against related debt obligations since International Paper has, and
intends to affect, a legal right of offset to net-settle these two amounts. Other outstanding debt related to the above transactions of $464 million and $465 million is included in floating rate notes due 2011 – 2016, and $4 million and $7
million is included in short-term notes in the summary of long-term debt in Note 12 for 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Based on an
analysis of these entities under guidance that considers the potential magnitude of the variability in the structures and which party has a controlling financial interest, International Paper determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the
above entities, and therefore, should not con-



solidate its investments in these entities. It was also determined that the source of variability in the structure is the value of the Timber Notes and Monetized Notes, the assets most
significantly impacting each structure’s economic performance. The credit quality of the Timber Notes and Monetized Notes are supported by irrevocable letters of credit obtained by third party buyers which are 100% cash collateralized.
International Paper analyzed which party has control over the economic performance of each entity, and concluded International Paper does not have control over significant decisions surrounding the Timber Notes, Monetized Notes and letters of credit
and therefore is not the primary beneficiary. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss equals the value of the Timber Notes and Monetized Notes; however, an analysis performed by the Company concluded the likelihood of this exposure is remote.

PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARIES

In March 2003, Southeast Timber, Inc. (Southeast Timber), a consolidated subsidiary of International Paper, issued $150 million of preferred securities to a private investor with future dividend payments based on
LIBOR. Southeast Timber, which through a subsidiary initially held approximately 1.5 million acres of forestlands in the southern United States, was International Paper’s primary vehicle for sales of southern forestlands. As of
December 31, 2010, substantially all of these forestlands have been sold. These preferred securities may be put back to International Paper by the private investor upon the occurrence of certain events, and have a liquidation preference that
approximates their face amount. The $150 million preferred third-party interest is included in Noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Distributions paid to the third-party investor were $5 million, $6 million and
$10 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The expense related to these preferred securities is shown in Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

NOTE 12 DEBT AND LINES OF CREDIT

In November 2010, International Paper repaid approximately $54 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 7.3% to 9.375% and original maturities from 2018 to 2039. Pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $13
million related to these debt payments are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

During the three months ended September 30, 2010, International Paper repaid approximately $111
mil-

lion of notes with interest rates ranging from 5.375% to 6.8% and original maturities from 2016 to 2024.

In May 2010, International Paper repaid approximately $108 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 5.3% to 9.375% and original maturities from 2015 to 2019. Pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $21
million related to these debt repayments are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations (offset by a $3 million gain on associated interest rate swaps as discussed in Note 13).

During the three months ended March 31, 2010, International Paper repaid approximately $120 million of notes with interest rates ranging from
5.25% to 7.4% and original maturities from 2010 to 2027. Pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $5 million related to these debt repayments are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations
(offset by a $1 million gain on associated interest rate swaps as discussed in Note 13).

In December 2009, International Paper issued
$750 million of 7.3% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in November 2039. The proceeds from this borrowing, along with available cash, were used to repay the remaining $1 billion of the $2.5 billion long-term debt issued in connection with
the CBPR business acquisition. During 2009, additional repayments related to this debt totaled approximately $1.4 billion.

Also in
December 2009, International Paper Investments (Luxembourg) S.a.r.l., a wholly-owned subsidiary of International Paper, repaid $214 million of notes with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 40 basis points and an original maturity in 2010.
Other debt activity during the three months ended December 31, 2009 included the repayment of approximately $235 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 4.0% to 9.375% and original maturities from 2009 to 2038. Pre-tax early debt
retirement costs of $36 million related to these debt repayments during the three months ended December 31, 2009 are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In August 2009, International Paper issued $1 billion of 7.5% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in August 2021. The proceeds from this
borrowing were used to repay approximately $942 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 5.125% to 7.4% and original maturities from 2012 to 2026. Pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $118 million



related to these debt repayments are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In May 2009, International Paper issued $1 billion of 9.375% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in May 2019. The proceeds from this
borrowing were used to repay approximately $875 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 4.0% to 9.25% and original maturities from 2010 to 2012. Also in April 2009, International Paper Company Europe Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
International Paper, repaid $75 million of notes issued in connection with the Ilim Holding S.A. joint venture that had matured. Pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $46 million related to debt repayments during the three months ended
June 30, 2009 are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In March
2009, Luxembourg borrowed $468 million of long-term debt with an initial interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 450 basis points that varied depending upon the credit rating of the Company, and a maturity date in March 2012. International Paper
used the $468 million of proceeds from the loan and cash of approximately $170 million to repay its 500 million euro-denominated debt (equivalent to $638 million at date of payment) with an original maturity date in August 2009. As of
September 30, 2009, the $468 million loan was repaid. Other debt activity during the three months ended March 31, 2009 included the repayment of approximately $366 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 4.25% to 5.0% that had
matured.

A summary of long-term debt follows:

(a)

The weighted average interest rate on these notes was 1.5% in 2010 and 2.0% in 2009.

(b)

The weighted average interest rate on these bonds was 5.6% in 2010 and 2009.

(c)

The weighted average interest rate was 3.2% in 2010 and 4.1% in 2009. Includes $146 million at December 31, 2010 and $161 million at December 31,
2009 related to non-U.S. denominated borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 4.3% in 2010 and 4.8% in 2009.

(d)

Includes an unamortized gain of $8 million at December 31, 2010 and a loss of $18 million at December 31, 2009, related to interest rate swaps
treated as fair value hedges. Also includes $70 million at December 31, 2010 and $80 million at December 31, 2009, related to the unamortized gain on interest rate swap unwinds (see Note 13).

(e)

The fair market value was approximately $9.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.

In addition to the long-term debt obligations shown above, International Paper has $5.7 billion of debt obligations payable to non-consolidated
variable interest entities having principal payments of $542 million due 2011 and $5.1 billion due in 2016, for which International Paper has, and intends to affect, a legal right to offset these obligations with Class B interests held in the
entities. Accordingly, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, International Paper has offset the $5.7 billion of debt obligations with $5.7 billion of Class B interests in these entities as of December 31, 2010 (see Note 11).

Total maturities of long-term debt over the next five years are 2011 – $313 million; 2012 – $324 million; 2013 – $135
million; 2014 - $559 million; and 2015 – $786 million. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, International Paper classified $100 million and $450 million, respectively, of current maturities of long-term debt as Long-term debt. International
Paper has the intent and ability to renew or convert these obligations, as evidenced by the available bank credit agreements described below.

At December 31, 2010, International Paper’s contractually committed credit facilities (the Agreements) totaled $2.5 billion. The Agreements generally provide for interest rates at a floating rate index
plus a pre-determined margin dependent upon International Paper’s credit rating. The Agreements include a $1.5 billion contractually committed bank facility that expires in November 2012 and has a facility fee of 0.50% payable quarterly. The
Agreements also include up to $1.0 billion of commercial paper-based financings based on eligible receivables balances ($877 million available as of December 31, 2010) under a receivables securitization program. On January 12, 2011, the
Company amended the



receivables securitization programs to extend the maturity date from January 2011 to January 2012. The amended agreement has a facility fee of 0.40% payable monthly. At December 31, 2010,
there were no borrowings under either the bank facility or receivables securitization program.

Maintaining an investment grade credit
rating is an important element of International Paper’s financing strategy. At December 31, 2010, the Company held long-term credit ratings of BBB (stable outlook) and Baa3 (stable outlook) by S&P and Moody’s, respectively.

NOTE 13 DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

International Paper periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and currency risks. International Paper does not hold or issue financial instruments
for trading purposes. For hedges that meet the hedge accounting criteria, International Paper, at inception, formally designates and documents the instrument as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge of a specific underlying
exposure, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. Derivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, determined using available market information or other appropriate
valuation methodologies, in Other current assets, Deferred charges and other assets, Other accrued liabilities or Other liabilities. The earnings impact resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is recorded in the same line
item in the consolidated statement of operations as the underlying exposure being hedged or in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges. Any ineffective portion of a financial instrument’s
change in fair value is recognized currently in earnings together with changes in the fair value of any derivatives not designated as hedges.

Foreign exchange contracts are used by International Paper to offset the earnings impact relating to the variability in exchange rates on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional
currencies and are not designated as hedges. Changes in the fair value of these instruments, recognized in earnings to offset the remeasurement of the related assets and liabilities, totaled a gain of approximately $33 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010 and a loss of $50 million and $30 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and

2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding undesignated foreign exchange contracts included the following:

UNDESIGNATED VOLUMES

Interest rate swap agreements of $1 billion floating-to-fixed notional and an offsetting $1 billion fixed-to-floating notional that did not qualify
as hedges under the accounting guidance during 2010 and matured in September 2010 resulted in a $22 million gain that was recognized in earnings for the year ended December 2010.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value
hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.

International Paper utilizes interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of the benchmark interest rates of fixed rate debt. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the outstanding notional amounts of
interest rate swap agreements that qualify as fully effective fair value hedges were approximately $274 million and $1.1 billion, respectively.

During the three months ended June 30, 2010, in connection with early debt extinguishment, interest rate swap agreements that were issued in the fourth quarter of 2009 with a notional value of $2 million were
undesignated as effective fair value hedges. The resulting gain was immaterial. Also related to early debt extinguishment, deferred gains of $3 million related to previously terminated effective interest rate swaps were recognized in earnings. This
gain is included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In June 2010, interest
rate swap agreements issued in the fourth quarter of 2009 and designated as fair value hedges with a notional value of $100 million were terminated. The termination was not in connection with early retirement of debt. The resulting



gain of $3 million was deferred and recorded in Long-term debt and is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the life of the underlying debt through 2019.

In January 2010, approximately $700 million of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that were issued in 2009 were terminated. These terminations
were not in connection with early debt retirements. The resulting $2 million gain was deferred and recorded in Long-term debt and is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the life of the underlying debt through April 2015.

During the three months ended March 31, 2010, a previously deferred gain of $1 million was recognized in earnings in connection
with early debt retirements. This gain is included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

During the three months ended December 31, 2009, the Company entered into various fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of approximately $1 billion to hedge existing debt. The
interest rate swaps were effective December 2009 and would have matured within a range of five to ten years. Also in August of 2009, the Company entered into a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of $100 million. The
interest rate swap was effective August 2009 with an original maturity date in April 2015. These interest rate swaps were designated as fully effective fair value hedges of the benchmark interest rate under ASC 815. Subsequently in 2010, the
majority of these interest rate swaps were terminated or undesignated. See above for a discussion of the 2010 activity.

During the
three months ended September 30, 2009, in connection with various early debt retirements, interest rate swap hedges with a notional value of $520 million, including $500 million of swaps issued during the three months ended June 30, 2009,
were terminated or undesignated as an effective fair value hedge resulting in a gain of approximately $9 million. This gain is included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

During 2009, an interest rate swap agreement designated as a fair value hedge with a notional value of $100 million was terminated, resulting in a
gain of $11 million that was deferred and recorded in Long-term debt. This gain will be amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the life of the underlying debt through 2016. Also, previously

deferred gains of $40 million related to earlier swap terminations were recognized in earnings in connection with early debt retirements. These gains are included in Restructuring and other
charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is
reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are assessed both at inception and quarterly
thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the related underlying exposures. The fair value of the hedge instruments are reclassified out of AOCI to earnings if the hedge ceases to be highly effective or if
the hedged transaction is no longer probable.

Interest Rate Risk

International Paper utilizes interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of the benchmark interest rate of future interest payments. At
December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements that qualified as cash flow hedges.

In
September 2009, the Company undesignated the $1 billion of interest rate swaps that qualified as cash flow hedges and entered into an offsetting $1 billion fixed-to-floating interest rate swap with a maturity date in September 2010 to minimize the
earnings exposure from the undesignated swaps. Subsequently in December 2009 in connection with early debt retirements, a $24 million loss related to the fair value of these swaps was reclassified from AOCI and included in Restructuring and other
charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

Also, during the three months ended September 30, 2009, in
connection with various early debt retirements, unamortized deferred losses of approximately $10 million related to earlier swap terminations were reclassified from AOCI and included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations.

During the three months ended December 31, 2009, the Company entered into treasury rate lock
agreements to fix interest rates on an anticipated issuance of debt. Upon issuance of the debt later in the quarter, these agreements generated a pre-tax loss of $3 million that was recorded in AOCI. This amount is



being amortized to interest expense over the term of the bonds through August 2039, yielding an effective interest rate of 7.3%.

Commodity Risk

To minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the
price of commodities, International Paper utilizes swap contracts to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases. At December 31, 2010,
the hedged volumes of these energy contracts totaled 200,000 barrels of fuel oil and 12 Million British Thermal Units (MMBTUs) of natural gas. These contracts had maturities of two years or less as of December 31, 2010. At December 31,
2009, the hedged volumes totaled 900,000 barrels of fuel oil and 21 MMBTUs of natural gas. Deferred losses totaling $15 million after taxes at December 31, 2010 are expected to be recognized through earnings within the next 12 months.

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign exchange contracts are also used as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies to manage
volatility associated with these transactions and to protect International Paper from currency fluctuations between the contract date and ultimate settlement. At December 31, 2010, these contracts have maturities of three years or less.
Deferred gains of $10 million after taxes at December 31, 2010 are expected to be recognized through earnings within the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the following outstanding foreign exchange
contracts were entered into as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions:

DESIGNATED VOLUMES

On June 30, 2010, foreign exchange contracts to sell 123 million U.S. dollars and buy Brazilian reals were undesignated as cash flow
hedges of an International Paper wholly-owned subsidiary’s foreign exchange risk due to the forecasted transactions not being probable. In July 2010, the undesignated
for-

eign exchange contracts were terminated resulting in cash received of $5 million. The change, a $3 million gain, in the fair value of the contracts since they were undesignated was recognized in
earnings. The fair value of the contracts when they were undesignated, a $1 million gain after taxes, was deferred in AOCI since the forecasted transactions remained reasonably possible. The deferred gain will be reclassified out of AOCI to earnings
when the forecasted transactions are no longer reasonably possible or when the hedged transactions affect earnings. As of December 31, 2010, the forecasted transactions remained reasonably possible.

Fair Value Measurements

International Paper’s financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value consist of derivative contracts, including interest
rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts, and other financial instruments that are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and currency risks. In addition, a consolidated subsidiary of International Paper has an embedded
derivative. For these financial instruments and the embedded derivative, fair value is determined at each balance sheet date using an income approach. Below is a description of the valuation calculation and the inputs used for each class of
contract:

Interest Rate
Contracts

are valued using swap curves obtained from an independent market data provider. The market value of each contract is the sum of the fair value of all future interest payments between the
contract counterparties, discounted to present value. The fair value of the future interest payments is determined by comparing the contract rate to the derived forward interest rate and present valued using the appropriate derived interest rate
curve.

Fuel Oil Contracts

are
valued using the average of two forward fuel oil curves as quoted by third parties. The fair value of each contract is determined by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the corresponding fuel oil contract and present valued using the
appropriate interest rate curve.

Natural Gas Contracts

are traded over-the- counter and settled using the NYMEX last day settle price; therefore, forward contracts are valued using the closing prices of the NYMEX natural gas future contracts. The fair value of each
contract is determined by comparing the strike price to the closing price of the corresponding natural gas future contract and present valued using the appropriate interest rate curve.



Foreign Exchange Contracts

are valued using the foreign currency forward and interest rate curves obtained from an independent market data provider. The fair value of each contract is determined by comparing the contract rate to the forward
rate. The fair value is present valued using the applicable interest rate from an independent market data provider.

Derivatives

are valued using a hypothetical interest rate derivative with identical terms. The hypothetical interest rate derivative contracts are fair valued as described above under Interest Rate Contracts.

Since the volume and level of activity of the markets that each of the above contracts are traded in has been normal, the fair value calculations
have not been

adjusted for inactive markets or disorderly transactions.

The guidance for fair
value measurements and disclosures sets out a fair value hierarchy that groups fair value measurement inputs into three classifications: Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or
liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Transfers
between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. All of International Paper’s fair value measurements use Level 2 inputs. The following table provides a summary of the impact of our derivative instruments in the consolidated
balance sheet:

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

International Paper evaluates credit risk by monitoring its exposure with each counterparty to ensure that exposure stays within acceptable policy
limits. Credit risk is also mitigated by contractual provisions with the majority of our banks. Most of the contracts include a credit support annex that requires the posting of collateral by the counterparty or International Paper based on each
party’s rating and level of exposure. Based on the Company’s current credit rating, the collateral threshold is generally $10 million. If the lower of the Company’s credit rating by Moody’s or S&P were to drop below
investment grade, the Company would be required to post collateral for all of its derivatives in a net liability position, although no derivatives would terminate. The fair values of derivative instruments containing credit-risk-related contingent
features in a net liability position were $32 million as of December 31, 2010 and $65 million as of December 31, 2009. The Company was not required to post any collateral as of December 31, 2010 and an immaterial amount of collateral
was posted as of December 31, 2009 due to exceeding the counterparty’s collateral threshold in the normal course of business. In addition, existing derivative contracts (except foreign exchange contracts) provide for netting across most
derivative positions in the event a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation. International Paper currently does not expect any of the counterparties to default on their obligations.

NOTE 14 CAPITAL STOCK

The authorized capital stock at both December 31, 2010 and 2009, consisted of 990,850,000 shares of common stock, $1 par value; 400,000 shares of cumulative $4 preferred stock, without par value (stated value
$100 per share); and 8,750,000 shares of serial preferred stock, $1 par value. The serial preferred

stock is issuable in one or more series by the Board of Directors without further shareholder action.

In December 2008, the Company retired 60,000,000 shares of its common stock held in treasury.

The
following is a rollforward of common stock activity for the three years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

NOTE 15 RETIREMENT PLANS

U.S.
DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS

International Paper sponsors and maintains the Retirement Plan of International Paper Company (the
“Pension Plan”), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides retirement benefits to substantially all U.S. salaried employees and hourly employees (receiving salaried benefits) hired prior to July 1, 2004, and
substantially all other U.S. hourly and union employees who work at a participating business unit regardless of hire date. These employees generally are eligible to participate in the Pension Plan upon attaining 21 years of age and completing one
year of eligibility service. U.S. salaried employees



and hourly employees (receiving salaried benefits) hired after June 30, 2004, are not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan, but receive a company contribution to their individual
savings plan accounts (see “Other U.S. Plans” on page 85). The Pension Plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of credited service and either final average earnings (salaried employees and hourly employees receiving salaried
benefits), hourly job rates or specified benefit rates (hourly and union employees).

Former Weyerhaeuser Company salaried and hourly
employees acquired by International Paper in the CBPR acquisition became participants in the Pension Plan if they were hired by Weyerhaeuser prior to July 1, 2004. Acquired salaried employees and hourly employees (receiving salaried benefits)
hired by Weyerhaeuser after June 30, 2004 are not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan and instead receive a company contribution to their savings plan accounts.

In connection with the CBPR acquisition, International Paper assumed sponsorship in 2008 of the Western Kraft, Albany, Oregon, Hourly Employees’ Retirement Plan, a defined benefit pension plan covering hourly
employees at the Albany, Oregon mill. The assets and liabilities of that plan were merged into the Pension Plan as of December 31, 2009.

The Company’s funding policy for the Pension Plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate
considering the funded status of the plans, tax deductibility, cash flow generated by the Company, and other factors. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions. Voluntary contributions totaling $1.15
billion were made by the Company in 2010. No contributions were made in 2009 or 2008.

The Company also has two unfunded nonqualified
defined benefit pension plans: a Pension Restoration Plan available to employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 that provides retirement benefits based on eligible compensation in excess of limits set by the Internal Revenue Service, and a
supplemental retirement plan for senior managers (SERP), which is an alternative retirement plan for salaried employees who are senior vice presidents and above or who are designated by the chief executive officer as participants. These nonqualified
plans are only funded to

the extent of benefits paid, which totaled $37 million, $35 million and $24 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and which are expected to be $36 million in 2011.

Net Periodic Pension Expense

Service cost is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the plans’ benefit formula to services rendered by employees during the
year. Interest cost represents the increase in the projected benefit obligation, which is a discounted amount, due to the passage of time. The expected return on plan assets reflects the computed amount of current-year earnings from the investment
of plan assets using an estimated long-term rate of return.

Net periodic pension expense for qualified and nonqualified U.S. defined
benefit plans comprised the following:

(a)

Excludes $1.1 million in 2008 in curtailment losses, and $83.2 million and $13.9 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, of termination benefits, in
connection with cost reduction programs and facility rationalizations that were recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statement of operations.

The increase in 2010 pension expense reflects a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 5.80% in 2010 from 6.00% in 2009 and higher amortization
of unrecognized actuarial losses.

International Paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of December 31 (the
measurement date) and considers changes in these long-term factors based upon market conditions and the requirements for employers’ accounting for pensions. These assumptions are used to calculate benefit obligations as of December 31 of
the current year and pension expense to be recorded in the following year (i.e., the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010 was also the discount rate used to determine net pension expense for the 2011
year).



Weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension expense for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as
follows:

The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio. Projected rates of return are developed through an asset/liability study in which
projected returns for each of the plan’s asset classes are determined after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocation for each asset
class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio is developed considering the effects of active portfolio management and expenses paid from plan assets. The discount rate assumption was determined based on a yield curve that incorporates
approximately 500 Aa-graded bonds. The plan’s projected cash flows were then matched to the yield curve to develop the discount rate. To calculate pension expense for 2011, the Company will use an expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets of 8.25%, a discount rate of 5.60% and an assumed rate of compensation increase of 3.75%. The Company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately $179 million for its U.S. defined benefit plans in 2011, with the
decrease from expense of $231 million in 2010 reflecting increased plan assets and higher than expected asset returns in 2010, partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate.

The following illustrates the effect on pension expense for 2011 of a 25 basis point decrease in the above assumptions:

Investment Policy / Strategy

International Paper’s Board of Directors has appointed a Fiduciary Review Committee that is responsible for fiduciary oversight of the Pension Plan, approving investment policy and reviewing the management and
control of plan assets. Pension Plan assets are invested to maximize returns within prudent levels of risk. The Pension Plan maintains a strategic asset allocation policy that designates target allocations by asset class. Investments are diversified
across classes and within each class to minimize the risk of large losses. Derivatives, including swaps, forward and futures contracts, may be used as asset class substitutes or for hedging or other risk management purposes. Periodic reviews are
made of investment policy objectives and investment manager performance.

International Paper’s pension allocations by type of fund
at December 31, and target allocations were as follows:

The fair values of International
Paper’s pension plan assets at December 31, 2010 by asset class are shown below. Plan assets included an immaterial amount of International Paper common stock at December 31, 2010. No International Paper shares were included in plan
assets in 2009. Hedge funds disclosed in the following table are allocated equally between equity and fixed income accounts for target allocation purposes. Cash and cash equivalent portfolios are allocated to the types of account from which they
originated. Mortgage backed securities were transferred from significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) in 2009 to significant observable inputs (Level 2) in 2010 as a result of identifying observable market data for the securities.



Equity securities consist primarily of publicly traded U.S. companies and international companies and common collective funds. Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing prices reported in the active market
in which the individual securities are traded. Common collective funds are valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the measurement date.

Fixed income consists of corporate bonds, government securities, and common collective funds. Government securities are valued by third-party
pricing sources. Corporate bonds are valued using either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or using a discounted cash flows approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields
of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks. Common collective funds are valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the
measurement date.

Commodities consist of commodity-linked notes and commodity-linked derivatives. Commodities are valued at closing
prices determined by calculation agents for outstanding transactions.

Hedge funds are investment structures that pursue a diverse array of investment strategies with a
wide range of different securities and derivative instruments. These investments are made through funds-of-funds (commingled, multi-manager fund structures) and through direct investments in individual hedge funds. Hedge funds are primarily valued
by each fund’s third party administrator based upon the valuation of the underlying securities and instruments and primarily by applying a market or income valuation methodology as appropriate depending on the specific type of security or
instrument held. Funds-of-funds are valued based upon the net asset values of the underlying investments in hedge funds.

Private equity
consists of interests in partnerships that invest in U.S. and non-U.S. debt and equity securities. Partnership interests are valued using the most recent general partner statement of fair value, updated for any subsequent partnership interest cash
flows.

Real estate includes commercial properties, land and timberland, and generally includes, but is not limited to, retail, office,
industrial, multifamily and hotel properties. Real estate holdings, taken together, are intended to have characteristics similar to, but not necessarily equal to, the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) Property Index.
Real estate fund values are primarily reported by the fund manager and are based on valuation of the underlying investments which include inputs such as cost, discounted cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data.

Derivative investments such as futures, forward contracts, options, and swaps are used to help manage risks. Derivatives are generally
employed as asset class substitutes (such as when employed within a portable alpha strategy), for managing asset/liability mismatches, or bona fide hedging or other appropriate risk management purposes. Derivative instruments are generally valued by
the investment managers or in certain instances by third party pricing sources.



The fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) at December 31,
2010 were as follows:

Fair Value Measurements Using Significant

Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)

Transferred out of Level 3 to Level 2 because market data for these securities was observable.

At December 31, 2010, projected future pension benefit payments, excluding any termination
benefits, were as follows:

Pension
Plan Asset / Liability

As required by ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” the pension plan funded
status must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. Therefore, pension plan gains or losses and prior service costs not yet recognized in net periodic cost are recognized on a net-of-tax basis in OCI. These amounts will be subject to
amortization in the future.

At December 31, 2010, the fair value of plan assets for the Pension Plan was less than the projected benefit obligation (PBO). However, the deficit was lower than at December 31, 2009,
resulting in a decrease in the recorded minimum pension obligation of $1.3 billion and an after-tax credit to OCI of $92 million. An after-tax credit to OCI of $318 million and an after-tax charge to OCI of $1.8 billion had been recorded for 2009
and 2008, respectively. For the unfunded nonqualified plans, changes in the liabilities resulted in after-tax charges to OCI of $19 million, $9 million and $5 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2008, in conjunction with the CBPR
business acquisition, the Company acquired a small overfunded pension plan covering hourly employees at the Albany, Oregon mill. For this plan, the Company recorded an after-tax charge to OCI of $13 million at December 31, 2008.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans was $9.6 billion and $9.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

Unrecognized Actuarial Losses

ASC
715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount
rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes. These net gains and losses are recognized prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees
expected to receive benefits under the plans (approximately 9 years as of December 31, 2010) to the extent that they are not offset by gains in subsequent years. The estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from AOCI
into net periodic pension cost during the next fiscal year are expected to be $204 million and $31 million, respectively.

The following
table shows the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets for 2010 and 2009, and the plans’ funded status. The benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010 increased by $281 million, principally as a result of a decrease in the
discount rate assumption used in computing the estimated benefit obligation. Plan assets increased by $1.6 billion, reflecting favorable investment results and the $1.15 billion voluntary contribution.

The components of the $323 million decrease in the amounts recognized in OCI during 2010 consisted of:

The portion of the change in the funded status that was recognized either in net periodic benefit costs or OCI was $(92) million, $(483) million
and $3 billion for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS

Generally, International Paper’s non-U.S. pension plans are funded using the projected benefit as a target, except in certain countries where
funding of benefit plans is not required. Net periodic pension expense for non-U.S. plans was as follows:

Weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension expense for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

The following table shows the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets for 2010 and 2009,
and the plans’ funded status as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

The
components of the $2 million increase in the amounts recognized in OCI during 2010 consisted of:

The portion of the change in the funded status that was recognized in either net periodic benefit cost or OCI was $1 million, $(11) million and $40 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

For non-U.S. plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected
benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets totaled $42 million, $34 million and $2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Plan assets consist principally of common stock and fixed income
securities.

OTHER U.S. PLANS

International Paper sponsors the International Paper Company Salaried Savings Plan and the International Paper Company Hourly Savings Plan, both of
which are tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) savings plans. Substantially all U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees are eligible to participate and may make elective deferrals to such plans to save for retirement. International Paper
makes matching contributions to participant accounts on a specified percentage of employee deferrals as determined by the provisions of each plan. For eligible employees hired after June 30, 2004, the Company makes Retirement Savings Account
contributions equal to a percentage of an eligible employee’s pay. From February 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010, matching contributions to the International Paper Salaried Savings Plan were made in Company stock. Beginning in January
2011, matching contributions to the International Paper Salaried Savings Plan will be made in the form of cash contributions.

The
Company also sponsors the International Paper Company Deferred Compensation Savings Plan, which is an unfunded nonqualified defined contribution plan. This plan permits eligible employees to continue to make deferrals and receive company matching
contributions when their contributions to the International Paper Salaried Savings Plan are stopped due to limitations under U.S. tax law. Participant deferrals and company matching contributions are not invested in a separate trust, but are paid
directly from International Paper’s general assets at the time benefits become due and payable.

Company matching contributions to
the plans totaled approximately $87 million, $121 million and $80 million for the plan years ending in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



NOTE 16 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

International
Paper provides certain retiree health care and life insurance benefits covering certain U.S. salaried and hourly employees. These employees are generally eligible for benefits upon retirement and completion of a specified number of years of
creditable service. Excluded from company-provided medical benefits are salaried employees whose age plus years of employment with the Company totaled less than 60 as of January 1, 2004. International Paper does not fund these benefits prior to
payment and has the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans in the future.

The components of postretirement benefit expense
in 2010, 2009 and 2008, were as follows:

(a)

Excludes $0.8 million of curtailment gains in 2008 and $2.8 million and $0.5 million of termination benefits in 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to
cost reduction programs and facility rationalizations that were recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statement of operations.

International Paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of December 31 (the measurement date) and considers changes in these long-term factors based upon market conditions and the requirements of
employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions.

The discount rates used to determine net cost for the years
ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:




Discount rate

5.40

%

5.90

%

5.90

%

The
weighted average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

A 1% increase in the assumed annual health care cost trend rate would have increased the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2010 by approximately $12 million. A 1% decrease in the annual trend rate would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2010 by approximately $11
million. The effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1% increase or decrease would be approximately $1 million.

The plan is
only funded in an amount equal to benefits paid. The following table presents the changes in benefit obligation and plan assets for 2010 and 2009:

The non-current portion of the liability is included with the postemployment liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under
Postretirement and postemployment benefit obligation. In accordance with guidance under ASC 715, after-tax credits of $13 million and $41 million were recorded as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to adjust the funded status of the
plan.



The components of the $2 million decrease in the amounts recognized in OCI during 2010 consisted of:

The portion of the change in the funded status that was recognized in either net periodic benefit cost or OCI was $5 million, $(70) million and $10
million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The estimated amounts of net loss and prior service credit that will be amortized from
OCI into net postretirement benefit cost in 2011 are expected to be $8 million and $25 million, respectively.

At December 31,
2010, estimated total future postretirement benefit payments, net of participant contributions and estimated future Medicare Part D subsidy receipts, were as follows:

NON-U.S.
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

In addition to the U.S. plan, certain Canadian, Brazilian and Moroccan employees are eligible for retiree
health care and life insurance benefits. Net postretirement benefit cost for our non-U.S. plans was $1 million for 2010, $3 million for 2009 and $3 million for 2008. The benefit obligation for these plans was $24 million in 2010, $18 million in 2009
and $19 million in 2008.

NOTE 17 INCENTIVE PLANS

International Paper currently has an Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP) which, upon the approval by the Company’s shareholders in May 2009, replaced the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan
(LTICP). The ICP authorizes grants of restricted stock, restricted or deferred stock units, performance awards payable in cash or stock upon the attainment of specified performance goals, dividend equivalents, stock options, stock appreciation
rights, other

stock-based awards, and cash-based awards at the discretion of the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) that administers the ICP.
Additionally, stock appreciation rights (SAR’s) have been awarded to employees of a non-U.S. subsidiary, with 3,070 and 3,310 rights outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Restricted stock units (RSU’s) were also
awarded to certain non-U.S. employees with 26,150 and 44,100 units outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Additionally, restricted stock, which may be deferred into RSU’s, may be awarded under a Restricted Stock and
Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors.

STOCK OPTION PROGRAM

International Paper accounts for stock options in accordance with guidance under ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation.”
Compensation expense is recorded over the related service period based on the grant-date fair market value. Since all outstanding options were vested as of July 14, 2005, only replacement option grants are expensed. No replacement options were
granted in 2008, 2009 or 2010.

During each reporting period, diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that
“in-the-money” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace. When options are actually exercised, option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation
of earnings per common share, with no effect on reported earnings. Equity is also increased by the tax benefit that International Paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns.

Under the program, upon exercise of an option, a replacement option may be granted under certain circumstances with an exercise price equal to the
market price at the time of exercise and with a term extending to the expiration date of the original option.

The Company has
discontinued the issuance of stock options for all eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. In the United States, the stock option program was replaced with a performance-based restricted share program to more closely tie long-term incentive
compensation to Company performance on two key performance drivers: return on investment (ROI) and total shareholder return (TSR).



The following summarizes the status of the Stock Option Program and the changes during the three
years ending December 31, 2010:

(a)

The table does not include Continuity Award tandem stock options described below. No fair market value is assigned to these options under ASC 718. The
tandem restricted shares accompanying these options are expensed over their vesting period.

(b)

The table includes options outstanding under an acquired company plan under which options may no longer be granted.

PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED SHARES

Under
the Performance Share Program (PSP), contingent awards of International Paper common stock are granted by the Committee. The PSP awards are earned over a three-year period. One-fourth of the award is earned during each twelve-month period, with the
final one-fourth segment earned over the full three-year period. PSP awards are earned based on the achievement of defined performance rankings of ROI and TSR compared to ROI and TSR peer groups of companies. Awards are weighted 75% for ROI and 25%
for TSR for all participants except for officers for whom the awards are weighted 50% for ROI and 50% for TSR. The ROI component of the PSP awards is valued at the closing stock price on the day prior to the grant date. As the ROI component contains
a performance condition, compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period based on the most probable number of awards expected to vest. The

TSR component of the PSP awards is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation as the TSR component contains a market condition. The Monte Carlo simulation estimates the fair value of the TSR component
based on the expected term of the award, a risk-free rate, expected dividends, and the expected volatility for the Company and its competitors. The expected term is estimated based on the vesting period of the awards, the risk-free rate is based on
the yield on U.S. Treasury securities matching the vesting period, the expected dividends are assumed to be zero for all companies, and the volatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility over the expected term.

PSP awards issued to certain members of senior management are accounted for as liability awards, which are remeasured at fair value at each balance
sheet date. The valuation of these PSP liability awards is computed based on the same methodology as the PSP equity awards.

The
following table sets forth the assumptions used to determine compensation cost for the market condition component of the PSP plan:

(a)

Includes 165,127 shares related to retirements or terminations that are held for payout until the end of the performance period.



EXECUTIVE CONTINUITY AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD PROGRAMS

The Executive Continuity Award program provides for the granting of tandem awards of restricted stock and/or nonqualified stock options to key
executives. Grants are restricted and awards conditioned on attainment of a specified age. The awarding of a tandem stock option results in the cancellation of the related restricted shares.

The service-based Restricted Stock Award program (RSA), designed for recruitment, retention and special recognition purposes, also provides for
awards of restricted stock to key employees.

The following summarizes the activity of the Executive Continuity Award program and RSA
program for the three years ending December 31, 2010:

At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 a total of 18.8 million, 17.4 million and 28.1 million shares, respectively, were available for grant under the ICP.

NOTE 18 FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA

International Paper’s industry segments, Industrial Packaging, Printing Papers, Consumer Packaging, Distribution and Forest Products, are
consistent with the internal structure used to manage these businesses. Beginning on January 1, 2011, the Forest Products Business will no longer be reported by the Company as a separate industry segment due to the immateriality of the results
of the remaining business on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. All segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.

For management purposes, International Paper reports the operating performance of each business based on earnings before interest and
income taxes (EBIT) excluding special and extraordinary items, gains or losses on sales of businesses and cumulative effects of accounting changes. Intersegment sales and transfers are recorded at current market prices.

External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are
defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper’s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.

The Company also holds a 50% interest in Ilim that is a separate reportable industry segment. The Company recorded equity earnings, net of taxes,
of $55 million in 2010, equity losses, net of taxes, of $50 million in 2009 and equity earnings, net of taxes, of $54 million in 2008 for Ilim.

NOTE 19 SUBSEQUENT EVENT

The sale of the Company’s Kraft Papers business that closed in January 2007 contained an earnout provision that could potentially require KapStone to make an additional payment to International Paper in 2012.
Based on the results through the first four years of the earnout period, KapStone concluded that the threshold would be attained and the full earnout payment would be due to International Paper in 2012. On January 3, 2011, International Paper
signed an agreement with KapStone to allow KapStone to pay the Company on January 4, 2011, the discounted amount of $50 million that otherwise would have been owed in full under the agreement in 2012.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES:

As of December 31, 2010, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act were effective as of December 31, 2010.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting. Internal controls over financial reporting is the process designed by, or under the
supervision, of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to allow for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors;

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material
effect on our consolidated financial statements; and

•

provide reasonable assurance as to the detection of fraud.

All internal control systems have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control
objectives. The Company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures, contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and is audited by the internal audit function. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct
deficiencies as they are identified.

As of December 31, 2010, management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. In a report included on pages 48 and 49, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.

In making this assessment, we used the criteria described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP,
with direct access to our Board of Directors through our Audit and Finance Committee, has audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by us. Their report on the consolidated financial statements is included in Part II, Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Deloitte & Touche LLP has issued an attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S PROCESS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we followed a comprehensive compliance process across the enterprise to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting,
engaging employees at all levels of the organization. Our internal control environment includes an enterprise-wide attitude of integrity and



control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top.” This is exemplified by our ethics program that includes long-standing principles and policies on ethical business
conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of our business, which have been distributed to all employees; a toll-free telephone helpline whereby any employee may report suspected violations of
law or our policy; and an office of ethics and business practice. The internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel, appropriate delegation of authority and division of
responsibility, dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout the Company, and an extensive program of internal audits with management follow-up. Our Board of Directors, assisted by the Audit and Finance Committee, monitors the
integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting procedures, the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors, and other matters set forth in its charter. The Committee, which currently consists of five
independent directors, meets regularly with representatives of management, and with the independent auditors and the Internal Auditor, with and without management representatives in attendance, to review their activities.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Company has ongoing initiatives to standardize and upgrade its financial, operating and supply chain systems. The system upgrades will be implemented in stages, by business, over the next several years.
Management believes the necessary procedures are in place to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as these initiatives continue.

During the 2010 second quarter, the Company acquired SCA Packaging Asia. Integration activities, including a preliminary assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, are currently in process. The
initial annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting for SCA Packaging Asia will be conducted over the course of our 2011 assessment cycle.

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
