Part I

Item 1. Business

Introduction

Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CFC or the company) is an Ohio corporation formed in 1968.
Through its subsidiaries, CFC has been conducting insurance operations since 1950, marketing
commercial, personal and life insurance. The company reports results in four segments:

•

Commercial lines property casualty insurance

•

Personal lines property casualty insurance

•

Life insurance

•

Investments

The commercial lines and personal lines property casualty insurance segments combined to generate
80.8 percent of the company’s revenues in 2004. Revenues, income before income taxes, and
identifiable assets for these segments are included in Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Page 89. The company’s segments are defined based on the financial
information used internally to evaluate performance and determine the allocation of assets.

CFC owns 100 percent of its three subsidiaries: The Cincinnati Insurance Company, CFC Investment
Company and CinFin Capital Management Company. The Cincinnati Insurance Company owns 100 percent of
its three subsidiaries: The Cincinnati Casualty Company, The Cincinnati Indemnity Company and The
Cincinnati Life Insurance Company.

The Cincinnati Insurance Company, founded in 1950, leads the property casualty group known as The
Cincinnati Insurance Companies. The Cincinnati Casualty Company and The Cincinnati Indemnity
Company round out the property casualty insurance group, providing flexibility in pricing and
underwriting while ceding substantially all of their business to The Cincinnati Insurance Company.
The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company primarily markets life insurance and annuities. CFC
Investment Company complements the insurance subsidiaries with leasing and financing services.
CinFin Capital Management Company provides asset management services to institutions, corporations
and high net worth individuals.

CFC’s headquarters is located in Fairfield, Ohio. At December 31, 2004, the company had 3,884
headquarters and field associates. The company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) are available, free of charge, on the company’s Web site,

www.cinfin.com

, as soon
as possible after they have been filed with the SEC. Referenced Web sites, including the company’s
Web site, are not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Unless otherwise noted, estimated industry data are referenced from materials presented on a
statutory basis by A.M. Best Co., a leading insurance industry statistical, analytical and
financial strength rating organization. Statutory data for the company is labeled as such; all
other company data is presented on a GAAP basis.

Property Casualty Insurance Operations

Introduction

The company actively markets commercial insurance policies in 31 states through a select group
of 986 independent insurance agencies as of December 31, 2004. It actively markets all of its
personal lines insurance policies in 22 of those states.

In 2004, nine states with at least $100 million in commercial and personal lines agency earned
premium generated approximately 69 percent of total property casualty premiums. In these states,
agency earned premiums grew 9.2 percent, or $176 million. Ohio, where the company had 187
independent agencies at year-end 2004, accounted for 23.7 percent of total earned premiums. In the
22 states with
less than $100 million in agency earned premium, agency earned premiums grew 15.0 percent, or $119
million, in 2004.

Competitive Environment

There are approximately 3,100 property casualty insurance companies in the United States
operating independently or in groups and no single company or group is dominant. Property casualty
insurers can distribute their products through independent insurance agents, who sell the products
of many insurers, or captive agents, who sell the products of only one insurance company. Companies
that use captive agents, as well as companies selling directly to consumers through the mail,
Internet or telephone solicitations, are called direct writers.

The company is committed to the independent agent distribution system, recognizing that locally
based independent agencies have relationships in their communities that lead to profitable
business. The company’s field associates provide service and accountability to the agencies, living
in the communities they serve and working from offices in their homes, providing 24/7 availability.
The company differentiates itself by providing superior claims service and field

2004 10-K Page 1


underwriting, through locally based associates serving the needs of agents and policyholders; by offering
competitive products, rates and compensation; and by maintaining high financial strength ratings.

In 2003, the most recent period for which data is available, Cincinnati Insurance was the No. 1 or
No. 2 carrier in more than 70 percent of its agencies based on premium volume or number of
policies. For commercial lines, the company views its competition as the companies that distribute
through independent agents. For personal lines, policyholders are more likely to investigate
insurance options both through independent agents and through personal research with captive agents
or direct writers. The 986 independent agencies through which the company markets its commercial
lines products normally represent four to 12 insurance carriers, including both national and
regional carriers, some of which may be mutual companies. Management generally views regional
carriers as more challenging competition because they often are familiar with the local market and
focus on differentiating themselves through personal relationships with agencies.

Independent Agent Marketplace

Agencies chosen by the company demonstrate the same commitments that distinguish the company
in the marketplace: doing business person to person; offering broad, value-added services;
maintaining sound balance sheets and managing their agencies professionally. In 2003, the most
recent year industry data is available, on average, Cincinnati’s agencies were larger than the
industry average, with approximately 35 percent estimated to have more than $2 million in revenues.
According to data from a specialized consulting service to independent agents, in 2000,
approximately 22 percent of the 20,066 U.S. independent agents with more than $250,000 in revenues
had more than $2 million in revenues. The consulting service projects continued consolidation in
the agency marketplace, estimating that by 2010, the number of agencies with more than $250,000 in
revenues will decline to approximately 11,700, of which approximately 40 percent will have more
than $2 million in revenues. The company believes that its agencies will continue to be leading
agencies.

In 2004, property casualty agencies representing the company averaged approximately $3.1 million in
agency earned premiums for the company compared with approximately $2.9 million in 2003 and $2.6
million in 2002. Agencies that have represented the company for less than five years averaged
slightly less than $1 million in agency earned premium for the company in 2004. Established
agencies that have represented the company five years or more averaged approximately $3.4 million
in agency earned premium for the company in 2004. No single agency accounted for more than 1.1
percent of the company’s total agency earned premiums in 2004.

Growth Strategies

In addition to growth of its agencies, the premium increases reflected efforts to improve
customer service through the creation of smaller marketing territories, permitting local field
marketing representatives to devote more time to each independent agency. At year-end 2004, the
company had 92 property casualty field territories, up from 87 at the end of 2003 and 83 at the end
of 2002. During 2005, the company plans to subdivide and staff at least eight additional
territories, which would bring the total number of field territories to 100. As part of this
program, the company plans to create a Delaware/Maryland territory in mid-2005. The planned
Delaware/Maryland territory represents both the
subdivision of the current Maryland territory and the company’s entry into Delaware, its first new
state since 2000.

During 2004, the company selectively appointed 48 new agencies within existing marketing
territories. The company plans to add 100 new agencies in 2005 and 2006. New appointments were made
in 21 of the 31 states in which the company actively markets insurance. Care is taken when
selecting and appointing new agencies to minimize market disruption for existing agencies. Of the
48 new agencies, 31 will market the company’s full complement of property casualty insurance and 17
will market commercial lines only. An additional three agencies were appointed in 2004 to market
the company’s surety bond products, bringing its total of surety-only independent agencies to nine.
These nine agencies are not included in the 986 property casualty agency total.

The company believes that it can continue to grow by taking actions intended to maintain or
increase its penetration within its agencies and through the selective appointment of additional
agencies. Other than Delaware, the company does not expect to enter any new states in the near
future.

Competitive Position

The company’s competitive position reflects:

•

Field marketing staff who provide local
decision-making authority. They are responsible
for selecting new independent agencies as well
as underwriting and pricing new commercial
business. Because of their local presence, they
are aware of local market conditions and are
familiar with the risks for which they make
these decisions. They round out their efforts by
coordinating field teams of specialized company
representatives and promoting all of the
company’s products within the agencies they
serve.

•

Risk-specific decisions made about both new
business and renewals. On a case-by-case basis,
the company selects risks it can cover on
acceptable terms and at adequate prices rather
than underwriting solely by geographic location
or business class. For new commercial lines
business, this case-by-case underwriting is
coordinated by the local field marketing
representatives and relies on their knowledge
and agents’ knowledge of the people and

2004 10-K Page 2


businesses in their communities. Policy renewals
are coordinated by headquarters underwriters who
are assigned to specific agencies and consult
with local field staff, as needed.

The company seeks to be a consistent, predictable
and reasonable carrier that agencies can rely
on to serve their communities.

•

Commitment to products and services needed to serve agency clients
– the policyholders. The company’s commercial products are
structured to allow many coverages to be combined in a single
package with a single expiration date. The company’s commercial
lines segment offers three-year policy terms for most insurance
packages, a key competitive strategy. Although the company offers
three-year terms, premiums for some coverages within those
packages are adjustable at anniversary for the subsequent annual
period, and policies may be cancelled at any time at the
discretion of the policyholder. The package approach brings
policyholders convenience, discounts and a reduced risk of
coverage gaps or disputes. At the same time, it increases account
retention and saves time and expense.

•

Superior claims service. Agencies generally have authority to pay
first-party claims immediately up to $2,500. Locally based field
claims representatives, who work from their homes, are assigned to
specific agencies. They generally respond within 24 hours of
receiving an agency’s claim report. The company believes the
higher level of service provided by field claims representatives
familiar with an agency and its policyholders provides it with a
competitive advantage.

•

Improved service to and communication with agencies through an
expanding portfolio of software. The company expects to continue
to strengthen its relationships with agencies through the
introduction and use of technology that is designed to bring
agencies greater efficiencies and to permit associates to spend
more time with people and less with paper. Certain technology
project implementation phases were rescheduled to the first half
of 2005, rather than the fourth quarter of 2004, because of
testing of control systems as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
These short-term schedule changes are not expected to
significantly affect project completion timelines.

Technology initiatives completed or ongoing include:

2004 10-K Page 3

CinciBond™, a new automated system to process license and permit surety bonds, was
delivered to a small group of Ohio agencies for testing in late 2004. CinciBond enables
agents to issue and print bonds at their office. Responses were positive and delivery to
the remaining Ohio agencies and those in several additional states is anticipated during
late 2005.

In all cases, the objective is to enhance the level of personal service that the company
delivers by automating office functions.

•

Full-spectrum of products to enhance relationships with agencies – The Cincinnati Life
Insurance Company, CFC Investment Company and CinFin Capital Management complement the
property casualty operations by providing products and services that attract and retain
high-quality independent insurance agencies.

°

Cincinnati Life seeks to round out and protect accounts in the property casualty agency
and to improve account persistency. At the same time, the life operation looks to increase
diversification, revenues and profitability for both the agency and the company. This
strategy enhances the already strong relationship built by the combination of the property
casualty and life companies. Cincinnati Life seeks to become the life insurance carrier of
choice for the independent agencies that work with the property casualty operations by providing
competitive products, responsive underwriting, high quality service and reasonable
commissions.

°

CFC Investment Company offers equipment and vehicle leases and loans for independent
insurance agencies, their commercial clients and other businesses. It also provides
commercial real estate loans to agencies to help them operate and expand their businesses.

°

CinFin Capital Management markets asset management services to agents and their
customers, as well as other institutions, corporations and individuals.

•

Programs to support agency growth. These include education
programs for agents and staff and financing for buildings and
equipment. In 2004, the insurance subsidiaries augmented ongoing
training programs with a number of special events, including
seminars held around the country to encourage cross-serving
policyholders by expanding awareness of the company’s broad
portfolio of products among producing agents. Headquarters
programs and agent schools are well attended and differentiate the
company from its peers.

•

Superior financial strength ratings. Insurance companies are rated
on their financial strength and claims-paying ability, providing
consumers with comparative information. The company historically
has been awarded high financial strength ratings that distinguish
it from other carriers (see Financial Strength Ratings, Page 7).
Among other factors, independent ratings organizations focus on
items such as results of operations, capital resources and minimum
policyholders’ surplus requirements as well as qualitative
analysis. While management believes its financial position will
continue to be strong, the independent rating agencies could
change their criteria or the company’s ratings based on their
ongoing reviews.

•

Consistently high rankings in surveys of insurance companies. In a
2004 study, Ward Group again named Cincinnati Insurance to its
annual lists of the top 50 property casualty and life/health
insurers in America. Insurers and groups qualify based on
financial safety, consistency and performance over the past five
years. Cincinnati is one of only eight property casualty insurers
that have qualified for the list in each of its 14 years and one
of only 10 property casualty insurers for which the life insurance
affiliate also qualified.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) Online Consumer Information Sources
measures the company’s low complaint ratio (

www.naic.org

) at 0.32 versus the national median of
1.00 for 2003, the most recent year for which data is available. NAIC members head state
departments of insurance.

Loss and Loss Expense Reserves

When claims are made by or against policyholders, any amounts that the company’s property
casualty operations pay or expect to pay to the claimant are termed losses. The costs of
investigating, resolving and processing these claims are termed loss expenses. The consolidated
financial statements include property casualty loss and loss expense reserves that estimate the
costs of paying claims incurred through December 31 of each year. The reserves include estimates
for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not yet
reported, along with estimates of loss expenses associated with processing and settling those
claims. The various estimates are developed based on individual claim evaluations and statistical
projections. Loss reserves are reduced by the estimated amount of salvage and subrogation.

While the company believes that reported reserves are sufficient for all unpaid loss and loss
expense obligations, the estimation process involves uncertainty by its very nature. The estimates
are continually reviewed, and as facts regarding individual claims develop and new information
becomes known, the reserve is adjusted as necessary. Adjustments due to loss development for prior
years are reflected in the calendar year in which they are identified. Item 7, Property Casualty
Loss and Loss Expense Reserves, Page 25, includes more information about the process used to
analyze potential losses and establish reserves.

The anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating reserves for loss and
loss expenses. While anticipated cost increases due to inflation are considered in estimating the
ultimate claim costs, the increase in

2004 10-K Page 4


average severity of claims is caused by a number of factors
that vary with the individual type of policy. Average severity projections are based on historical
trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards, policy provisions and general
economic trends. These
trends are monitored based on actual development. The company does not discount any of its property
casualty loss and loss expense reserves.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the company’s reserve for losses and loss
expenses at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, is presented in Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Page 82. The reconciliation of the December 31, 2003, reserve balance to net
incurred losses one year later recognizes approximately $196 million in redundant reserves. The
redundancy was partially due to the 2004 release of $32 million in Ohio uninsured
motorist/underinsured motorist reserves as discussed in Item 7, Property Casualty Reserve Levels,
Page 55.

Differences between the property casualty reserves reported in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets (prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America – GAAP) and those same reserves reported in the annual statements (filed with
state insurance departments in accordance with statutory accounting practices – SAP), relate
principally to the reporting of reinsurance recoverables, which are recognized as receivables for
GAAP and as an offset to reserves for SAP.

The table above shows the development of the estimated reserves for loss and loss expenses for the
years prior to 2004:

•

Section A shows the total property casualty loss and loss expense
reserves recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the
indicated calendar years on a gross and net basis. Those reserves
represent the estimated amount of loss and loss expenses for
claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance
sheet date, including losses that have been incurred but not yet
reported to the company.

•

Section B shows the cumulative net amount paid with respect to the
previously recorded reserve as of the end of each succeeding year.
For example, as of December 31, 2004, the company paid $953
million of loss and loss

2004 10-K Page 5


expenses in calendar years 1995 through
2004, for losses that occurred in accident years 1994 and prior.
As a result, an estimated $144 million of losses remain unpaid as
of year-end 2004 (net re-estimated reserves of $1.097 billion less
cumulative paid loss and loss expenses of $953 million).

•

Section C shows the re-estimated amount of the previously reported
reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding
year. The estimate is increased or decreased as more information
becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims.

•

Section D, cumulative net redundancy, represents the aggregate
change in the estimates for all years subsequent to the year the
reserves were initially established. For example, reserves
established at December 31, 1994, had developed a $335 million
redundancy over 10 years, net of reinsurance, which has been
reflected in income over the 10 years. The effects on income in
2004, 2003 and 2002
of changes in estimates of the reserves for loss and loss expenses for all accident years are
shown in the reconciliation above.

In evaluating this information, it should be noted that each amount includes the effects of all
changes in amounts for prior periods. For example, payments or reserve adjustments related to
losses settled in 2004 but incurred in 1998 will be included in the cumulative deficiency or
redundancy amount for 1999 and each subsequent year. In addition this table presents calendar year
data, not accident or policy year development data, which readers may be more accustomed to
analyzing. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the reserve in the past may not
necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future
redundancies or deficiencies based on this data.

Reinsurance

The company has property and casualty working reinsurance treaties for 2004 through
reinsurance companies that have written its treaties for more than 15 years. The strong
relationships the company has with these reinsurers has allowed the company to negotiate what it
considers to be favorable terms and conditions during a difficult time in the market cycle. To add
further diversification to the reinsurance program, Partner Reinsurance Company of the U.S. was
added to the property per risk and casualty per occurrence treaties effective January 1, 2005,
joining American Re-Insurance Company, GE Insurance Solutions and Swiss Reinsurance America
Corporation. The property casualty working treaties align the company with what it considers to be
four of the most financially sound reinsurance companies in the world. The company also secures
property catastrophe coverage and catastrophic casualty protection.

The 2005 property and casualty reinsurance program encompasses five primary components:

2004 10-K Page 6


event and will
retain 40 percent of losses from $25 million to $45 million, down from 43 percent in 2004. The
company retains 5 percent of all losses in excess of $45 million, up to $500 million.

Individual risks with insured values in excess of $25 million as identified in the policy are
handled through a different reinsurance mechanism. Property coverage for individual risks with
insured values between $25 million and $50 million are reinsured under an automatic facultative
treaty. For those risks with property values exceeding $50 million, the company negotiates the
purchase of facultative coverage on an individual certificate basis. For casualty coverage on
individual risks with limits exceeding $25 million, facultative reinsurance coverage is placed on
an individual certificate basis.

Responding to the challenges presented by terrorism has become a very important issue for the
insurance industry over the last three years. Terrorism coverage at various levels has been secured
in all of the company’s reinsurance agreements. The broadest coverage for this peril is found in
the property and casualty working treaties, which provide coverage for commercial and personal
risks. The company’s property catastrophe treaty provides coverage for personal risks and the
majority of its reinsurers provide limited coverage for commercial risks with total insured values
of $10 million or less. For insured values between $10 million and $25 million, there also may be
coverage in the property working treaty.

Reinsurance protection for the company’s surety business is covered under separate treaties with
many of the same reinsurers that write the property casualty working treaties.

The estimated incremental cost increase of $13 million for the 2005 property casualty working
reinsurance agreements is primarily due to the growth in the company’s premium base. The company
believes it has the financial ability to absorb losses at the current retention levels, and the
2005 reinsurance agreements are a means of balancing reinsurance costs with what it considers to be
an acceptable level of risk. Reinsurance does not relieve the company of its obligation to pay
covered claims. The financial strength of the company’s reinsurers is important because the
company’s ability to recover losses under one of the reinsurance agreements depends on the
financial viability of the reinsurer.

Reinsurance protection for the company’s life insurance business is covered under separate treaties
with many of the same reinsurers that write the property casualty working treaties. In 2005, the
company modified its reinsurance protection for the life insurance business due to changes in the
marketplace during 2004 that affected the cost and availability of reinsurance for term life
insurance. Previously, the company retained 20 percent of each term policy, not to exceed $500,000,
and ceded the balance of mortality risk and policy reserve. Under the new program, the company will
continue to retain no more than a $500,000 exposure, ceding the balance using excess over retention
mortality coverage, but will retain the policy reserve. Retaining the policy reserve has no direct
impact on GAAP results. Because of the conservative nature of statutory reserving principles,
retaining the policy reserve does have a negative impact on statutory income. The company currently
is researching alternative reinsurance solutions to moderate the effect on statutory income of
retaining the policy reserve for new term business. Management believes it will be able to
structure this portion of the reinsurance program to provide the life insurance company with the
ability to continue to grow in the term life insurance marketplace while appropriately managing
risk, at a cost that allows the company to achieve its profit targets.

Financial Strength Ratings

Cincinnati Financial is awarded credit (debt) ratings (see Item 7, Long- and Short-term Debt,
Page 60, for a discussion of the company’s credit ratings), and its insurance subsidiaries are
awarded insurer financial strength ratings. The following summarizes the insurer financial strength
ratings as of March 4, 2005. Insurer financial strength ratings assess an insurer’s ability to meet
its financial obligations to policyholders and do not necessarily address matters that may be
important to shareholders.

In March 2004, A.M. Best affirmed its top A++ (Superior) financial strength
ratings and stable outlook for the company’s property casualty group and
subsidiaries. Less than 2 percent of the approximately 1,090 insurer groups
A.M. Best reviews annually qualify for the A++ rating.

2004 10-K Page 7


Management believes that its superior insurer financial strength ratings are clear, competitive
advantages in the segment of the insurance marketplace that the company’s agents serve. The
company’s financial strength supports the consistent, predictable performance that its
policyholders, agents, associates and shareholders have always expected and received, and it must
be able to withstand significant challenges. The most important way management seeks to ensure that
the
company remains consistent and predictable is to align agents’ interests with those of the company,
giving agents outstanding service and compensation to earn their best business.

While the potential for volatility exists due to the company’s catastrophe exposures, investment
philosophy and bias towards incremental change, the ratings agencies consistently have asserted
that the company has built appropriate financial strength and flexibility to manage that volatility
and seek higher long-term returns for shareholders. Management remains committed to strategies that
emphasize long-term stability instead of quickly reacting to changes in market conditions to obtain
short-term benefits. For example, the company maintains strong insurance company statutory-basis
surplus, a solid reinsurance program, sound reserving practices and low interest rate risk, as well
as low debt and strong capital at the parent-company level.

In 2004, the board of directors and management established parameters around the property casualty
company’s strong statutory surplus position that led to some short-term actions. The new parameters
allow the company to remain consistent with its long-term underwriting and equity investing
strategies while responding to risk factors that are studied carefully by the ratings agencies.

In the second quarter of 2004, the company:

•

Changed the allocation of new property casualty portfolio investments to reduce the ratio of common
stock to statutory surplus. The property casualty portfolio maintained that ratio below 100 percent
throughout the 1990s. The ratio was 103.5 percent at year-end 2004 compared with 114.7 percent at
year-end 2003 after moving as high as 120.5 percent after Codification was adopted in 2000 (see
Regulation, Page 15, for information regarding Codification of Statutory Accounting Practices). The
company anticipates allocating cash flow available for investment to fixed-income securities through
mid-2005 (see Item 7, Investment Portfolio, Page 53, for additional information regarding portfolio
allocation).

•

Sold or reduced common stock positions in the property casualty portfolio that the investment committee
of the board of directors believed no longer met the company’s investment parameters (see Item 7,
Investments Results

2004 10-K Page 8


Of Operations, Page 47, for a discussion of equity securities sold during 2004). The
$356 million sold was equivalent to less than 5 percent of the consolidated equity portfolio. The
proceeds were reinvested in fixed income and convertible securities. The equity sales were a primary
reason for the company’s high realized gains in 2004.

•

Added another $100 million layer to the property casualty reinsurance program, raising the limit to $500
million, effective April 1, 2004 (see Reinsurance, Page 6, for additional information regarding the
company’s reinsurance programs).

•

Began changing homeowner policy earthquake deductibles to 10 percent from 5 percent.

These property casualty actions did not signal a change in the company’s overall investment
philosophy. The company remains fully committed to a long-term equity focus that management
believes is the key to the company’s long-term growth and stability (see Investments Segment, Page
13, for a discussion of the company’s investment strategy). The company currently intends to
continue to invest for income and growth, focusing on a total-return strategy supported by
investments in dividend-paying companies. Over the longer term, the company anticipates continuing
to invest in equity securities to help achieve its portfolio objectives. However, the company
believes that recent short-term actions to enhance the property casualty statutory surplus quality
should support the predictability viewed by rating agencies as one of the company’s primary
strengths, and by agents as a competitive advantage.

Commercial Lines Property Casualty Insurance Segment

The commercial lines property casualty insurance segment contributed $2.126 billion in net
earned premiums to the company’s total revenues and $338 million to income before income taxes in
2004. Commercial lines net earned premiums grew 11.4 percent in 2004, 10.8 percent in 2003 and 18.6
percent in 2002.

The company markets its full complement of commercial products in all 986 property casualty
independent agencies and all 31 states in which it markets property casualty insurance. The
company’s emphasis is on providing products that agents can market to small- to mid-size businesses
in their communities. The company monitors agency earned premium, which is earned premium before
reinsurance, on a by-state basis to evaluate its performance on a geographic basis. In 2004,
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, each with at least
$100 million in commercial lines agency earned premium, generated 59.3 percent of commercial lines
premiums compared with 60.4 percent in the prior year. In these states, agency earned premiums grew
10.0 percent, or $120 million, in 2004 compared with 11.9 percent, or $127 million, in 2003. Ohio,
where the company has 187 independent agencies, accounted for 18.7 percent of commercial lines
earned premiums, versus 19.4 percent in 2003. In the remaining 24 states, agency earned premiums
grew 15.2 percent and 17.7 percent, or $119 million and $118 million, in 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

From 2001 into 2003, the commercial lines marketplace implemented continued rate increases in
reaction to concerns about the economy, reserve shortfalls and rising loss severity, exacerbated by
the events of September 11, 2001. Also in response to rising loss severity, during that period,
some competitors announced decisions to exit geographic markets or specific lines of business;
others instituted across-the-board price increases. Industry analysts believed the market was
experiencing a renewed awareness of underwriting discipline. By late 2003, industry actions had
begun to ease many of these concerns.

From late-2003 through the end of 2004, competition has increased in the commercial lines
marketplace, particularly to attract quality new business. In the company’s experience, the level
of competition varies market-by-market, by line of business and by size of account. In most markets
where the company competes, the company believes that disciplined underwriting generally remains
the norm. In the company’s opinion, carriers are modifying prices rather than changing policy terms
and conditions.

2004 10-K Page 9


As competition in the commercial markets has increased, the company has maintained its pricing
discipline for both renewal and new business. While the company’s independent agents reported only
modest pressure on renewal pricing at the end of 2004, they communicated that winning new business
would require more pricing flexibility and careful risk selection. The company intends to remain a
stable
market for its agencies’ best business, and management believes that the company’s case-by-case
approach gives it a clear advantage. The company’s field marketing associates and its independent
agents work together to select risks and respond appropriately to local pricing trends.
Historically, they have proven capable of balancing risk and price to achieve growth in new
business over the longer term.

Looking ahead, management believes that opportunities to obtain new business and increase policy
count will come from its strong relationships with independent agencies, subdivision of territories
to enhance service and appointment of new agencies over the next several years. Offsetting new
appointments will be continued consolidation within the independent agency marketplace and
terminations of certain of its agency relationships.

Staying abreast of evolving market conditions is a critical function, accomplished in both an
informal and a formal manner. Informally, the field marketing representatives are in constant
receipt of market intelligence from the agencies with which they work. Formally, the commercial
lines product management group completes periodic market surveys to obtain competitive
intelligence. This market information helps to determine the top competitors by line of business or
specialty program and also determines market strengths and weaknesses for the company. The analysis
encompasses pricing, breadth of coverage and underwriting/eligibility issues. In addition to
reviewing the company’s competitive position, the product management group performs underwriting
audits to assess profitability initiatives. Further, the company’s research and development
department analyzes opportunities and develops new products, new coverage options and improvements
to existing insurance products.

The company’s standard approach is to write three-year policies, and it considers this a
competitive advantage in the commercial lines market. Although the company offers three-year terms,
premiums for some coverages within those policies are adjustable at anniversary for the subsequent
annual period, and policies may be cancelled at any time at the discretion of the policyholder.
While writing three-year policies would appear to restrict opportunities to quickly adjust pricing,
contract terms provide that the rates for automobile, workers compensation, professional liability
and most umbrella liability coverages within multi-year packages may be changed at each of the
policy’s annual anniversaries for the next one-year period. The annual rate adjustments could
incorporate rate changes approved by state insurance regulatory authorities between the date the
policy was written and its annual anniversary date, as well as changes in risk exposures and
premium credits or debits relating to loss experience, competition and other underwriting judgment
factors. Management estimates that approximately 75 percent of 2004 commercial premium was written
on a one-year policy term or was subject to annual rating adjustments.

In the company’s experience, multi-year packages can be marketed at rates that may be slightly
higher than annual package rates. By reducing annual administrative efforts, multi-year policies
reduce the company’s and agency’s expenses and the incentive for the policyholder to shop for a new
policy every year. Management believes that the advantages of three-year policies in terms of
policyholder convenience, account retention and reduced administrative costs outweigh the potential
disadvantage of these policies, even in periods of rising rates.

Management believes that its three-year commercial policies are somewhat less price sensitive for
quality-conscious insurance buyers who are typical customers of the company’s independent agents.
For three years, or even over relationships that last decades, those policyholders have experienced
the company’s personal claims service, benefited from the company’s coverage packages and relied on
the company’s high financial strength ratings. Customized insurance programs on a three-year term
complement the relationships these policyholders have with their agents and with the company. They
may be less inclined to shop their accounts annually.

In 2003, the company resumed writing three-year policies for contractor risks in most states
because of these advantages. In 2002, the company temporarily wrote one-year policies for
contractor risks while awaiting state regulatory approval for two significant coverage changes in
the company’s general liability and umbrella coverage forms. The changes brought the company’s
policy forms in line with industry practices by capping the amount payable during a policy period
(usually 12 months) for certain types of liability claims and by clarifying how a policy responds
once the insured learns that injury or damage has occurred during a prior policy period. Looking
ahead, the company expects that these changes will help the company better manage liability losses
and remain a viable market for agents to
place coverage for well-managed, reputable contractors. Underwriters carefully monitor new and
renewal contractor business, continuing to write one-year policies when competitive or underwriting
issues make three-year policies impractical.

Four business lines – commercial multi-peril, workers compensation, commercial automobile and other
liability – account for approximately 90 percent of commercial lines earned premiums.

•

Commercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and
liability coverage. Property insurance covers damages such as
those caused by fire, wind, hail, water, theft, vandalism and
business interruption resulting from a covered loss. Liability
coverage insures businesses against third-party liability from
accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their
operations, such as injuries sustained from products sold.

2004 10-K Page 10


•

Workers compensation covers employers for specified benefits
payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries to
employees.

•

Commercial auto covers businesses for liability to others for both
bodily injury and property damage, medical payments to insureds
and occupants of their vehicles, physical damage to an insured’s
own vehicle from collision and various other perils, and damages
caused by uninsured motorists..

•

Other liability includes commercial umbrella, commercial general
liability and most executive risk policies, which cover liability
exposures including bodily injury, directors and officers and
employment practices, property damage arising from products sold
and general business operations.

The remainder of commercial lines earned premiums was derived from a variety of other types of
insurance products the company offers to commercial customers, including fiduciary and surety bonds
and machinery and equipment policies.

Personal Lines Property Casualty Insurance Segment

The personal lines property casualty insurance segment contributed $793 million in net earned
premiums to the company’s total revenues and a $40 million loss before income taxes in 2004.
Personal lines net earned premiums grew 6.4 percent in 2004, 11.2 percent in 2003 and 8.2 percent
in 2002.

The company actively markets its personal lines products in 22 of the 31 states in which it markets
commercial lines insurance and selected products within certain agencies in the nine remaining
states. In 2004, Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio, each with $35
million or more in personal lines agency earned premium, generated 76.2 percent of personal lines
premiums, compared with 76.9 percent in 2003. In these states, agency earned premiums grew 6.4
percent, or $37 million, in 2004, versus 8.6 percent, or $46 million, in the prior year. Ohio,
where the company has 182 independent agencies writing personal lines products, accounted for 37.6
percent of 2004 personal lines agency earned premiums compared with 38.2 percent in 2003. In the
remaining 21 states, agency earned premiums grew 10.7 percent and 16.2 percent, or $19 million and
$24 million, in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Since 2000, the company has observed that the personal lines marketplace has focused on
underwriting discipline rather than market share. The result has been an industry-wide improvement
in profitability, augmented by favorable loss frequency and severity trends. Overall, rates for
both personal auto and homeowner insurance have risen in conjunction with stricter enforcement of
underwriting guidelines. Despite the record level of industry-wide catastrophe losses in 2004,
competition began to increase during the year in the personal lines marketplace, with industry
analysts observing a plateau in year-over-year rate filings.

The company markets homeowners and personal automobile insurance products through 706 of its 986
independent agencies. The 280 agencies that do not market the full complement of personal lines
products either are located in states in which the company does not actively market these products
or the company has determined, in conjunction with agency management, that the company’s personal
lines products are not appropriate for their agencies at this time. Personal automobile accounted
for 56.8 percent and homeowners accounted for 32.6 percent of personal lines net earned premium in
2004.

•

Personal automobile covers liability to others for both bodily
injury and property damage, medical payments to insureds and
occupants of their vehicle, physical damage to an insured’s own
vehicle from collision and various other perils, and damages
caused by uninsured motorists.. In addition, many states require
policies to provide first-party personal injury protection,
frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.

2004 10-K Page 11


•

Homeowners covers losses to dwellings and contents from a wide
variety of perils, as well as liability arising out of personal
activities both on and off the covered premises. The company also
offers coverage for condominium unit owners and renters.

The remainder of personal lines earned premium was derived from a variety of other types of
insurance products the company offers to individuals such as dwelling fire, inland marine, personal
umbrella liability and watercraft coverages.

Life Insurance Segment

The life insurance segment contributed $104 million of the company’s total revenues and a $2
million gain before income taxes in 2004. See Item 7, Life Insurance, Page 45, for additional
information regarding life insurance segment profitability.

The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company’s mission complements that of the overall company: to provide
products and services that attract and retain high quality independent insurance agencies. The
company primarily focuses on life products that produce revenue growth through a steady stream of
premiums.

Cincinnati Life seeks to round out and protect accounts in the property casualty agency and to
improve account persistency. At the same time, the life operation looks to increase
diversification, revenues and profitability for both the agency and the company. This strategy
enhances the already strong relationship built by the combination of the property casualty and life
companies.

Cincinnati Life seeks to become the life insurance carrier of choice for the independent agencies
that work with the property casualty operations by providing competitive products, responsive
underwriting, high quality service and reasonable commissions. At year-end 2004, approximately 89
percent of the company’s 986 property casualty agencies offered Cincinnati Life’s products to their
policyholders. The life company also seeks to develop life business from other independent life
insurance agencies in a manner that does not conflict or compete with the property casualty
agencies.

Four lines of business – term insurance, whole life insurance, universal life insurance and
worksite products – account for approximately 85 percent of the life insurance segment’s revenues:

•

Term insurance – policies under which the benefit is
payable only if the insured dies during a specified
period of time or term; no benefit is payable if the
insured survives to the end of the term. While
premiums are fixed, they must be paid as scheduled.
The proposed insured is evaluated using normal
underwriting standards.

•

Whole life insurance – policies that provide life
insurance for the entire lifetime of the insured; the
death benefit is guaranteed never to decrease and
premiums are guaranteed never to increase. While
premiums are fixed, they must be paid as scheduled.
These policies provide specified cash values that are
available to withdrawing policyholders. The proposed
insured is evaluated using normal underwriting
standards.

•

Universal life insurance – long-duration life
insurance policies. Contract premiums are neither
fixed nor guaranteed; however, the contract does
specify a minimum interest crediting rate and a
maximum cost of insurance charge and expense charge.
Premiums are not fixed and may be varied by the
contract owner. The cash values available to
withdrawing policyholders are not guaranteed and
depend on the amount and timing of actual premium
payments and the amount of actual contract
assessments. The proposed insured is evaluated using
normal underwriting standards.

•

Worksite products – term insurance, whole life
insurance, universal life and disability insurance
offered to employees through their employer. Premiums
are collected by the employer using payroll deduction.
Polices are issued using a simplified underwriting
approach and for smaller face amounts than similar
regularly underwritten policies. Worksite insurance
products provide the company’s property casualty
agency force with excellent cross serving
opportunities for both commercial and personal
accounts. Agents find that offering worksite marketing
to employees of their commercial accounts provides a
benefit to the employees at low cost to the employer.

In addition, Cincinnati Life markets:

•

Disability income insurance — provides monthly
benefits to offset the loss of income when the insured
person is unable to work due to accident or illness.

•

Deferred annuities — provide regular income payments
that commence after the end of a specified period or
when the annuitant attains a specified age. During the
deferral period, any payments made under the contract
accumulate at the crediting rate declared by the
company but not less than a contract-specified
guaranteed minimum interest rate of 3 percent to 4
percent. A deferred annuity may be surrendered during
the deferral period for a cash value equal to the
accumulated payments plus interest less the surrender
charge, if any.

•

Immediate annuities — provide some combination of
regular income and lump sum payments in exchange for a
single premium. Most of the immediate annuities
written by the life insurance segment are purchased by
the company’s property casualty companies to settle
casualty claims.

Cincinnati Life is a financially strong and stable life insurance company. Cincinnati Life’s
statutory adjusted risk-based surplus increased 10.7 percent to $491 million at December 31, 2004,
from $443 million a year earlier. Statutory

2004 10-K Page 12


adjusted risk-based surplus as a percentage of
liabilities, a key measure of life insurance company capital strength, were 38.3 percent at
year-end 2004 compared with an estimated industry average ratio of 10.5 percent. The higher the
ratio, the stronger an insurer’s security for policyholders and its capacity to support business
growth . A.M. Best – A+ (Superior), Fitch Ratings – AA (Very Strong) and Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services – AA- (Very Strong, negative outlook) maintained their ratings for Cincinnati Life in
2004.

Investments Segment

The investment segment contributed $583 million of the company’s total revenues in 2004,
primarily from net investment income and realized investment gains and losses from investment
portfolios managed for the holding company and each of the operating subsidiaries. Primarily from
investment income, it contributed $537 million of income before income taxes, or 67.2 percent of
total income before income taxes.

While the company seeks to generate an underwriting profit in its property casualty and life
segments, the investment segment historically has provided the primary source of profits and
contributed to the company’s financial strength, driving long-term growth in shareholders’ equity
and book value.

Under the direction of the investment committee of the board of directors, the company’s analysts
and portfolio managers seek to balance current investment income opportunities and long-term
appreciation so that current cash flows from both insurance and investment operations can be
compounded to achieve above-average long-term total return.

While focused on long-term total return, the company maintains liquidity to meet both its immediate
and long-range insurance obligations with the purchase and maintenance of medium-risk
fixed-maturity and equity securities. Historically, approximately 65 percent to 70 percent of
available cash has been invested in fixed-income securities with the remaining 30 percent to 35
percent invested in equity and equity-linked securities.

In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, convertible securities are included in
fixed-maturities or equity securities, based on the characteristics of the underlying security
(bond or preferred stock). When monitoring and evaluating investment operations results, the
company broadly categorizes investments as fixed-income securities, which includes investment-grade
corporate bonds, high-yield corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal bonds; and equity and
equity-linked securities, which includes common and preferred stocks and all convertible
securities.

At year-end 2004 and 2003, these five classes of assets accounted for the following:

Fixed-income Securities

By maintaining a well diversified fixed-income portfolio, the company attempts to reduce
overall credit risk. The company invests new money in the bond market on a continuous basis,
targeting what management believes to be optimal risk-adjusted after-tax yields. Risk, in this
context, includes both credit and interest rate risk. Management does not make concerted efforts to
alter duration on a portfolio basis in response to anticipated movements in interest rates. By
continually investing in the bond market, the company builds a broad, diversified portfolio that
management believes mitigates the impact of adverse economic factors. In recent years, the company
has taken into account the trend toward a flatter corporate yield curve and an overall decline in
credit quality by purchasing higher-quality corporate bonds with shorter maturities as well as
tax-exempt municipal bonds and U.S. agency paper. The company’s focus on long-term total return may
result in variability in the levels of realized and unrealized investment gains or losses from one
period to the next.

With the exception of U.S. agency paper, no individual fixed-income issuer’s securities accounted
for more than 0.6 percent of the fixed-income portfolio at December 31, 2004. For the insurance
companies’ portfolios, strong emphasis is placed on purchasing current income-producing securities.

•

Investment-grade corporate bonds have a Moody’s rating at or above
Baa 3 or a Standard & Poor’s rating at or above BBB-. The company
seeks to balance current income with potential changes in market
value as well as changes in credit risk when determining whether
or not to hold these securities to maturity.

•

High-yield corporate bonds have a Moody’s rating below Baa 3 or a
Standard & Poor’s rating below BBB-. The company’s strong capital
position provides the flexibility to invest in these securities in
addition to investment-grade corporate bonds. While such
investments tend to have higher yields, they are inherently more
risky, as their

2004 10-K Page 13


ratings indicate, with a higher potential for
default by the issuer. Historically, they have contributed
positively to investment income and, in general, are less
sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Similar to
investment-grade bonds, the company seeks to balance current
income with potential changes in market value as well as changes
in credit risk
when determining whether or not to hold these securities to maturity. This
security class is closely monitored for selective buying opportunities, but
more importantly for changes in the market that may negatively affect existing
holdings. See Item 7A, Unrealized Investment Gains and Losses, Page 66, for
further discussion.

•

Tax-exempt municipal bonds are exempt from federal
taxes, a feature the company continues to find
attractive. However, the company invests in a blend
of tax-exempt and taxable fixed-maturity securities
because of alternative minimum tax effects. The
company traditionally has purchased municipal bonds
focusing on essential services, such as schools,
sewer, water or others. While no single municipal
issuer accounted for more than 1.4 percent of the
tax-exempt municipal bond portfolio at December 31,
2004, concentrations within individual states can be
high. Holdings in five states – Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Texas and Washington – accounted for 61.0
percent of the municipal bond portfolio at year-end
2004.

Equity and Equity-linked Securities

The company’s equity and equity-linked securities portfolio includes a core group of common
stocks that the company can monitor closely to gain an in-depth understanding of their organization
and industry. It also includes a broader group of smaller positions in common and preferred stocks
and convertible securities, which can be a source of trading flexibility and other risk management
advantages. The company’s portfolio of equity investments had an average dividend yield-to-cost of
11.5 percent at December 31, 2004.

•

Common stocks – At December 31, 2004, 35.8 percent of the common stock holdings (measured
by market value) were held at the parent company level. Common stock investments generally are
securities with annual dividend yields of 1.5 percent to 3.0 percent and histories of dividend

When investing in common stock, management seeks to identify companies in which it can
accumulate more than 5 percent of their outstanding shares. There also is a core group of common
stocks in which the company holds a market value of at least $100 million. At year-end 2004,
there were 14 holdings in that core group, including three of the four investments where the
company held more than 5 percent of their outstanding shares. While this emphasis on a small
group of equities and long-term investment horizon has resulted in significant concentrations
within the portfolio, the company has followed this buy-and-hold strategy for many years,
resulting in significant accumulated unrealized appreciation within the equity portfolio. At
year-end 2004, the largest
industry concentrations within these large common equity holdings were the financials sector at
65.9 percent of total market value and the healthcare sector at 5.7 percent of total market
value. (See Item 7, Investment Results of Operations, Page 47, for a discussion of equity
securities sold during 2004.)

•

Convertible securities – For more than 30 years, the company has invested in convertible
bonds and convertible preferred stocks. These securities are the primary trading vehicle in
the portfolio. Management believes the conversion features enhance the overall values of these
securities and does not believe that investments in convertible securities pose any
significant risk to the company or its portfolio due to their characteristics. As a class,
convertible securities tend to be less sensitive to interest rate changes than fixed-rate
securities and less sensitive to market conditions than common stocks.

Additional information regarding the composition of investments is included in Item 8, Note 2 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 80.

Regulation

State Regulation

The business of insurance primarily is regulated by state law. Although the company’s
insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Ohio and primarily subject to Ohio insurance laws and
regulations, the company also is subject to state regulatory authorities of all states in which it
writes insurance. The state laws and regulations that have the most significant effect on the
company’s insurance operations and financial reporting are discussed below.

2004 10-K page 15


2004 10-K page 16


Federal Regulation

Although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate
the business of insurance, federal initiatives often have an impact. Some of the current and
proposed federal measures that may significantly affect the company’s business are discussed below.

Financial
undertaken during the period that it was an unregistered investment company, subject to
equitable considerations set forth in the Investment Company Act. As a result, it could be
determined that holders of Cincinnati Financial’s $420 million aggregate principal amount of
6.9% Senior Debentures due 2028 have a right to rescind such indebtedness, thereby requiring
Cincinnati Financial to immediately repay such amounts. Cincinnati Financial may be unable to
refinance such obligations on acceptable terms. However, Cincinnati Financial currently has
available sufficient assets to fund such repayment and believes that its assets are adequate to
meet its short- and long-term obligations.

To avoid regulation under the Investment Company Act in the future, the company’s operations
are, to an extent, limited by the constraint that investment securities held at the holding
company level remain below the 40 percent threshold described above. These considerations could
require the company to dispose of otherwise desirable investment securities under undesirable
conditions or otherwise avoid economically advantageous transactions. Although management
intends to manage assets to stay below the 40 percent threshold (unless the SEC grants the
company’s request for an exemptive order), events beyond the company’s control, including
significant appreciation in the market value of certain investment securities, could result in
the company breaching the 40 percent threshold. While management believes that even in such
circumstances the company would not be an investment company because it is primarily engaged in
the business of insurance through its subsidiaries, the SEC, among others, could disagree with
this position. If it were established that the company is an unregistered investment company,
there would be a risk, among the other material adverse consequences described above, that the
parent company could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an
action brought by the SEC.

Investment Advisers Act of
1940 — One of the company’s
subsidiaries, CinFin Capital
Management Company, operates an
investment advisory business and is
therefore subject to regulation by
the SEC as a registered investment
adviser under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. This law
imposes certain annual reporting,
record keeping, client disclosure
and compliance obligations on
CinFin Capital Management.

has not been informed that the tenant intends to vacate the property and the tenant has until
August 2005 to notify the company of their intent. This property is carried in the financial
statements at $3 million as of December 31, 2004, and is classified as other invested assets.

In 2004, the company decided to undertake a building expansion at its headquarters location in
Fairfield, Ohio. Preparation for construction of an underground garage and third office tower began
in January 2005. The new tower will contain more than 690,000 total square feet, including the
garage. It will rise seven stories above three underground parking levels with 700 parking spaces.

recovery of $23 million of the $39 million one-time, pretax charge incurred in 2000.

2000 — The company recorded a one-time charge of $39 million, pretax, to write down previously
capitalized costs related to the development of software to process property casualty policies.

2000 — The company earned $5 million in interest in the first quarter from a $303 million

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction

The purpose of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis is to provide an understanding of
Cincinnati Financial Corporation’s (CFC) consolidated results of operations and financial position.
It begins with an overview of the company and its outlook, a safe harbor statement that covers
factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated by management and details on the
company’s critical accounting policies and estimates. It should be read in conjunction with Item 6,
Selected Financial Data, Pages 20 and 21, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related
Notes, beginning on Page 72. Per share amounts have been adjusted for the 5 percent stock dividend
paid June 15, 2004; per share data has not been adjusted for the 5 percent stock dividend to be
paid on April 26, 2005.

Unless otherwise noted, estimated industry data are referenced from materials presented on a
statutory basis by A.M. Best, a leading insurance industry statistical, analytical and financial
strength rating organization. Statutory data for the company is labeled as such; all other company
data is presented on a GAAP basis.

Executive Summary

Cincinnati Financial Corporation is the parent company of the nation’s 25

th

largest
property casualty insurer, based on statutory net written premium volume through the first nine
months of 2004. The company marketed property casualty insurance products through a select group of
986 independent insurance agencies in 31 states at year-end 2004.

The company is built on a foundation of personal relationships with these local independent
insurance agents. These agents have an informed, front line perspective that benefits policyholders
as well as the company, helping to create profitability and value for shareholders. Local-resident
field marketing and other associates live in the communities they serve, working from offices in
their homes and providing 24/7 availability. They are assigned directly to agencies, where they are
able to provide prompt and personal service, gain firsthand knowledge and be effective decision
makers for the company. The company differentiates itself by its commitment to: providing
exceptional claims service and field underwriting through locally based associates serving the
needs of agents and policyholders; offering competitive products, rates and compensation; and
maintaining excellent financial strength ratings. Headquarters associates, including approximately
600 underwriters, are assigned to specific agencies and provide important support to the field
staff and agencies.

In addition to property casualty insurance products, the company offers life insurance, leasing and
asset management services to help attract and retain high quality independent insurance agencies.
This strategy helps diversify revenues and profitability for both the agency and the company and
enhances the already strong relationship built by the property casualty operations.

Among the various factors that influence the consolidated results of operations and financial
position of the company, management considers its relationships with independent agencies to be the
most significant. To continue to achieve its performance targets, the company must maintain its
strong relationships with the select group of agencies with which it does business, write a
significant portion of each agency’s business and attract new agencies. The company seeks to be an
indispensable partner in each agency’s success. The company measures its accomplishment of this
objective based on being the largest or second largest carrier in each agency, either by dollars of
premium or number of policies written, depending on the agency’s mix of business.

The company’s strong surplus and asset positions provide security for policyholders while allowing
for a successful, equity-centered investment strategy.

By consistently applying long-term strategies rather than taking short-term actions, the company
seeks to build shareholder value by:

•

Achieving above industry average growth in property casualty
statutory net written premiums and maintaining industry-leading
profitability by leveraging its regional franchise and proven
agency-centered business strategy.

•

Pursuing a total return investment strategy that generates both
strong investment income growth and capital appreciation.

•

Maintaining financial strength by keeping the ratio of debt to
capital low and purchasing reinsurance to protect investment
flexibility.

•

Increasing the total return to shareholders through a combination
of higher earnings per share, growth in book value and increasing
dividends. The board of directors is committed to steadily
increasing cash dividends and periodically authorizing stock
dividends and splits. The board has increased the indicated annual
dividend rate for 45 consecutive years, a record the company
believes is matched by only 11 other publicly traded corporations.

In 2004, the company reported record results, as described in detail in the results of operations.
Statutory net written premium growth outpaced the estimated industry average while the combined
ratio, a common measure of profitability

2004 10-K Page 23


for property casualty insurers, was significantly better
than the estimated industry average. The growth rate of investment income reached its highest level
in four years and book value reached a new record, as growth in net income more than offset market
fluctuations in the equity portfolio. The company’s financial position continued to strengthen with
assets at a record level.

The company currently is pursuing a number of strategies to help it achieve its performance
objectives over the next several years:

In 2005, management believes the company will achieve statutory net written premium growth in the
mid-single digits and a GAAP combined ratio of 91 percent (equivalent to approximately 91 percent
on a statutory basis). A.M. Best estimates that 2005 net written premiums industry-wide may rise by
1 percent and that the 2005 industry statutory combined ratio may be approximately 97.3 percent.

Currently, management anticipates pretax investment income growth in 2005 in the range of 5 percent
to 6 percent. The investment portfolio is positioned for long-term capital appreciation. Equity and
equity-linked securities make up 34.0 percent of the portfolio based on book value and 62.7 percent
based on market value at year-end 2004.

Management expects that the impact of these anticipated strong operating results will be tempered
in 2005 by the adoption of option expensing and slightly higher interest expense on long-term debt,
which increased modestly with the November 2004 issue of $375 million aggregate principal amount of
senior notes due 2034. The company will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 123 (R), “Share-Based Payment,” which calls for stock option expense to be included as a
component of net income, in the third quarter of 2005. Pro forma option expense as disclosed in
Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 76, would have reduced earnings per
share by 7 cents in both 2004 and 2003 and 8 cents in 2002.

Safe Harbor Statement

This is a “Safe Harbor” statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Certain forward-looking statements contained herein involve potential risks and uncertainties. The
company’s
future results could differ materially from those discussed. Factors that could cause or contribute
to such differences include, but are not limited to:

•

Unusually high levels of catastrophe losses due to changes in weather patterns, environmental
events, terrorism incidents or other causes

•

Ability to obtain adequate reinsurance on acceptable terms, amount of reinsurance purchased
and financial strength of reinsurers

•

Increased frequency and/or severity of claims

•

Events or conditions that could weaken or harm the company’s relationships with its
independent agencies and hamper opportunities to add new agencies, resulting in limitations
on the company’s opportunities for growth, such as:

°

Downgrade of the company’s financial strength ratings,

°

Concerns that doing business with the company is too difficult or

°

Perceptions that the company’s level of service, particularly claims service, is no
longer a distinguishing characteristic in the marketplace

•

Insurance regulatory actions, legislation or court decisions or legal actions that increase expenses or place us at a
disadvantage in the marketplace

•

Delays in the development, implementation, performance and benefits of technology projects and enhancements

•

Inaccurate estimates or assumptions used for critical accounting estimates, including loss reserves

2004 10-K Page 24


•

Events that reduce the company’s ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the future

•

Recession or other economic conditions or regulatory, accounting or tax changes resulting in lower demand for insurance
products

•

Sustained decline in overall stock market values negatively affecting the company’s equity portfolio, in particular a
sustained decline in the market value of Fifth Third Bancorp shares, a significant equity holding

•

Events that lead to a significant decline in the market value of a particular security and impairment of the asset

•

Prolonged low interest rate environment or other factors that limit the company’s ability to generate growth in
investment income

•

Adverse outcomes from litigation or administrative proceedings

•

Effect on the insurance industry as a whole, and thus on the company’s business, of the suit brought by the Attorney
General of the State of New York against participants in the insurance industry, as well as any increased regulatory
oversight that might result from the suit

•

Limited flexibility in conducting investment activities if the restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act of
1940 were to become applicable to the parent company

Further, the company’s insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, economic
and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely
influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting
standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory
initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as recent measures
affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects,
if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

Readers are cautioned that the company undertakes no obligation to review or update the

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Cincinnati Financial Corporation’s financial statements are prepared using GAAP. These
principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements are
discussed in Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 76. In conjunction with
that discussion, material implications of uncertainties associated with the methods, assumptions
and estimates underlying the company’s critical accounting policies are discussed below. The audit
committee of the board of directors reviews the annual financial statements with management and the
independent registered public accounting firm. These discussions cover the quality of earnings,
review of reserves and accruals, reconsideration of the suitability of accounting principles,
review of highly judgmental areas including critical accounting policies, audit adjustments and
such other inquiries as may be appropriate.

Property Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves

Overview

The most significant estimates relate to the company’s reserves for property casualty loss and
loss expenses. Management believes that the stability of the company’s business makes its
historical data the most important source for establishing adequate reserve levels.

Management bases reserve estimates on company experience and information from internal analyses,
obtaining additional information from consulting outside actuaries. When reviewing reserves,
management analyzes historical data and estimates the effect of various loss development factors.
Management believes that the following represent the primary risks to its ability to estimate loss
reserves accurately:

•

Court decisions that result in unanticipated coverage expansions on past and existing policies

•

Changes in medical inflation and mortality rates that affect workers compensation claims

•

Changes in claim cost trends, including the effects of general economic and tort cost inflation, not reflected in the
historical data used to estimate loss reserves

•

Changes in reinsurance coverage, not reflected in reserving data, that affect the company’s net payments and net case
reserves

•

Payment and reporting pattern changes attributable to the implementation of a new claims management system

•

Reporting pattern changes attributable to changes in case reserving practices, particularly with respect to umbrella
claims

2004 10-K Page 25


•

Absence of cost-effective methods for assessing asbestos and environmental claim liabilities accurately (see Property
Casualty Reserve Levels, Asbestos and Environmental Reserves, Page 56, for discussion of related reserve levels and
trends)

Any of these factors can cause the company’s ultimate loss experience to be better or worse than
reserves held, and the difference could be material. To the extent that reserves are inadequate and
strengthened, the amount of such increase is treated as a charge in the period that the deficiency
is recognized, raising the loss and loss expense ratio and reducing earnings. To the extent that
reserves are redundant and released, the amount of the release is a credit in the period that the
redundancy is recognized, reducing the loss and loss expense ratio and increasing earnings.

A reserve change of $29 million has a 1 percentage-point effect on the loss and loss expense ratio,
based on 2004 earned premiums. Each 1 percentage point change in the loss and loss expense ratio
has a $19 million effect on income and an 11 cent per share effect on net income per share, based
on 2004 earned premiums.

Establishing Reserves

Reserves are established for the total of unpaid loss and loss expenses, including estimates
for claims that have been reported, estimates for claims that have been incurred but not yet
reported (IBNR) and estimates of loss expenses associated with processing and settling those
claims. Reserves are determined for the various lines of business. Loss reserves are reduced by salvage and subrogation
reserves.

Management establishes case reserves for claims that have been reported within the parameters of
coverage provided in the policy. Individual case reserves greater than $35,000 established by field
claims representatives are reviewed by experienced headquarters claims supervisors while case
reserves greater than $100,000 are reviewed by headquarters claims managers. The estimates reflect
informed judgment and experience of the company’s claims associates based on general insurance
reserving practices and their experience with the company. Case reserves are reviewed on a
90-day cycle, or more frequently if specific circumstances require, based on events such as the
status of ongoing negotiations.

In 2001, the company began to establish higher initial case reserves on serious liability claims to
reflect recent experience indicating the likelihood that juries would ignore significant liability
issues in cases involving seriously injured claimants.

To establish IBNR reserves on an annual basis, management uses a variety of tools, including
actuarial and statistical methods. These may include but are not limited to:

•

The Case Incurred Development Method

•

The Paid Development Method

•

The Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method

Supplemental statistical information is compiled and reviewed to aid in the application of the
actuarial methods. The supplemental data also is used to evaluate the reasonableness of estimates
derived from the actuarial methods. This information includes:

•

Industry loss frequency and severity and premium trends

•

Past, present and anticipated product pricing

•

Anticipated premium growth

•

Other quantifiable trends

•

Projected ultimate loss ratios

Management conducts its thorough evaluation of the adequacy of reserves as of the end of the third
quarter of each year. As a result, the most significant refinements in reserves historically have
been implemented in the fourth quarter. Less detailed, periodic reviews of reserve adequacy are
made at the other quarter ends. A loss review committee, including internal actuaries and
representatives from management of multiple operating departments, is responsible for the quarterly
review process.

The internal actuaries provide a point estimate to summarize their analysis. At year-end 2004 and
2003, IBNR reserves differed from the internal actuarial point estimate by less than 1 percent of
the company’s loss and loss expense reserve.

Adjusting Reserves

While the company believes that reported reserves provide for all unpaid loss and loss expense
obligations, the estimation processes involve a number of variables and assumptions. Management
believes this uncertainty is mitigated by the historical stability of the company’s book of
business and by its periodic reviews of estimates. As loss experience develops and new information
becomes known, the reserve is reviewed and adjusted as appropriate. In this process, the company
monitors trends in the industry, relevant court cases, legislative activity and other current
events in an effort to ascertain new or additional exposures to loss. If management determines that
reserves established in prior years were not sufficient or were excessive, the change is reflected
in current-year results.

2004 10-K Page 26


Outside Actuarial Review

As part of its internal processes, management utilizes an outside actuary to provide
management with an opinion regarding an acceptable range for adequate statutory reserves based on
generally accepted actuarial guidelines.

Historically, the company has established adequate reserves that have fallen in the upper half of
the outside actuary’s range. This approach has resulted in recognition of reserve redundancies (see
Item 1, Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Reserves, Development of Loss and Loss Expenses,
Page 5, for a 10-year history of reserve development). Modestly redundant reserves support the company’s business
strategy to retain high financial strength ratings and remain a market for agencies’ business in
all market conditions.

The outside actuaries conduct a thorough evaluation of the adequacy of reserves as of the end of
the third quarter of each year and conduct a supplemental review of full-year data at year-end.

Highly Uncertain Exposures

In the normal course of its business, the company may provide coverage for exposures for which
estimates of losses are highly uncertain. Most significant are catastrophic events. Due to the
nature of these events, management is unable to predict precisely the frequency or potential cost
of catastrophe occurrences. However, in an effort to control such losses, the company foregoes
marketing property casualty insurance in California, reviews aggregate exposures to huge disasters
and monitors its exposure in certain coastal regions. The company has catastrophe exposure to:

•

Hurricanes in the gulf and southeastern coastal regions

•

Earthquakes in the New Madrid fault zone, which lies within the central Mississippi valley, extending from northeast
Arkansas through southeast Missouri, western Tennessee and western Kentucky to southern Illinois and southern Indiana

•

Tornado, wind and hail in the Midwest, Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions

The company uses the Risk Management Solutions and Applied Insurance Research models to evaluate
exposures to a once-in-250-year event in determining appropriate reinsurance coverage programs.
Reinsurance mitigates the risk of these highly uncertain exposures and limits the maximum net loss
that can arise from large risks or risks concentrated in areas of exposure. In conjunction with
these activities, the company also continues to explore and analyze credible scientific evidence,
including the impact of global climate change, which may affect its exposure under insurance
policies. Management’s decisions regarding the appropriate level of property casualty risk
retention are affected by various factors, including changes in the company’s underwriting
practices, capacity to retain risks and reinsurance market conditions. See Item 1, Reinsurance,
Page 6, for a discussion of the company’s 2005 reinsurance treaties.

Asset Impairment

Fixed-income and equity investments are the company’s largest assets. Certain estimates and
assumptions made by management relative to investment portfolio assets are critical. The company’s
asset impairment committee continually monitors investments and all other assets for signs of
other-than-temporary and/or permanent impairment. Among other signs, the committee monitors
significant decreases in the market value of the assets, changes in legal factors or in the
business climate, an accumulation of costs in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire
or construct an asset, uncollectability of all other assets, or other factors such as bankruptcy,
deterioration of creditworthiness, failure to pay interest or dividends or signs indicating that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

The application of the company’s impairment policy resulted in other-than-temporary impairment
charges and write-offs of investments that reduced the company’s income before income taxes by $6
million, $80 million and $98 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Other-than-temporary impairment in the value of securities is defined by the company as declines in
valuation that meet specific criteria established in the asset impairment policy. Such declines
often occur in conjunction with events taking place in the overall economy and market, combined
with events specific to the industry or operations of the issuing corporation. These specific
criteria include a declining trend in market value, the extent of the market value decline and the
length of time the value of the security has been depressed, as well as subjective measures such as
pending events and issuer liquidity. Generally, these declines in valuation are greater than might
be anticipated when viewed in the context of overall economic and market conditions. See Investment
Portfolio, Page 53, for information regarding valuation of the invested assets.

Impairment charges are recorded for other-than-temporary declines in value, if, in the asset
impairment committee’s judgment, there is little expectation that the value will be recouped in the
foreseeable future. The impairment policy defines a security as distressed when it is trading below
70 percent of book value or has a Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s credit rating below B3/B-. Distressed securities are
monitored as potentially impaired. The security may be written down in the event of a declining
market value for four consecutive quarters with quarter-end market value below 50 percent of book
value, or when a security’s market value is 50 percent below book value for three consecutive
quarters. A sudden and severe drop in market value that does not otherwise meet the above criteria
is reviewed for possible immediate impairment. Notwithstanding the above, the company’s portfolio
managers constantly

2004 10-K Page 27


monitor the status of their assigned portfolios for indications of potential
problems or issues that may be possible impairment issues. If an impairment indicator is noted, the
portfolio managers even more closely scrutinize the security.

When evaluating other-than-temporary impairments, the committee considers the company’s ability to
retain a security for a period adequate to recover a significant percentage of cost. Because of the
company’s investment philosophy and strong capitalization, it can hold securities that have the
potential to recover value until their scheduled redemption, when they might otherwise be deemed
impaired. Investment assets that have already been impaired are evaluated based on their adjusted
book value and further written down, if deemed appropriate. The decision to sell or write down an
asset with impairment indications reflects, at least in part, management’s opinion that the
security no longer meets the company’s investment expectations. See Item 7A, Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Unrealized Investment Gains and Losses, Page 66, for
detailed information regarding securities trading in a continuous loss position at December 31,
2004. Other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of investments are recognized in net income
as realized losses at the time when facts and circumstances indicate such write-downs are
warranted.

Permanent impairment charges (write-offs) are defined as those for which management believes there
is little potential for future recovery, for example, following the bankruptcy of the issuing
corporation. These permanent declines in the fair value of investments are written off at the time
when facts and circumstances indicate such write-downs are warranted, and they are reflected in
realized losses.

Other-than-temporary and permanent impairments are distinct from the ordinary fluctuations seen in
the value of a security when considered in the context of overall economic and market conditions.
Securities considered to have a temporary decline would be expected to recover their market value,
which may be at maturity, or are fixed-income securities that the company intends to hold until
maturity. Under the same accounting treatment as market value gains, temporary declines (changes in
the fair value of these securities) are reflected on the company’s balance sheet in other
comprehensive income, net of tax, and have no impact on reported net income.

Life Insurance Policy Reserves

Reserves for traditional life insurance policies are based on expected expenses, mortality,
withdrawal rates and investment yields, including a provision for adverse deviation. Once these
assumptions are established, they generally are maintained throughout the lives of the contracts.
Expected mortality is derived primarily from industry experience. Withdrawal rates are based on
company and industry experience, while investment yield is based on company experience and the
economic conditions then in effect.

Reserves for the company’s universal life, deferred annuity and investment contracts are equal to
the cumulative account balances, which include premium deposits plus credited interest less charges
and withdrawals.

Employee Benefit Plan

The company has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees.
Contributions and pension costs are developed from annual actuarial valuations. These valuations
involve key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets, which are
updated each year. Any adjustments to these assumptions are based on considerations of current
market conditions. Therefore, changes in the related pension costs or credits may occur in the
future due to changes in assumptions.

The key assumptions used in developing the 2004 net pension expense were a 6.0 percent discount
rate, an 8.0 percent expected return on plan assets and rates of compensation increases ranging
from 5 percent to 7 percent, depending on the age of the employee. The 8.0 percent return on plan
assets assumption is based on the fact that substantially all of the investments held by the pension plan
are common stocks that pay annual dividends. Management believes this rate is representative of the
expected long-term rate of return on these assets. These assumptions were consistent with the prior
year except that the discount rate was reduced by one half of one percent due to current market
conditions. In 2004, the net pension expense was $9 million. In 2005, the company expects a net
pension expense of $12 million, primarily as a result of a 0.5 percent reduction in the discount
rate and increased service costs.

Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half of one percent increase or decrease in the
discount rate would have increased or decreased the company’s 2004 net income before income taxes
by $1 million. Likewise, a one half of one percent increase or decrease in the expected return on
plan assets would have increased or decreased 2004 income before income taxes by $1 million.

In addition, the fair value of the plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation by $16
million at December 31, 2004, and by $21 million at December 31, 2003. The fair value of the plan
assets was less than the projected plan benefit obligation by $41 million at December 31, 2004, and
by $29 million at December 31, 2003. Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect
future assets and liabilities of the pension plan. The company expects to contribute approximately
$10 million to its pension plan in 2005.

2004 10-K Page 28


Deferred Acquisition Costs

The company establishes a deferred asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to
acquiring property casualty and life business. These costs are principally agent commissions,
premium taxes and certain underwriting costs, which are deferred and amortized into income as
premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs have grown in line with the growth in premiums.
Underlying assumptions are updated periodically to reflect actual experience. Changes in the
amounts or timing of estimated future profits could result in adjustments to the accumulated
amortization of these costs.

For property casualty policies, deferred costs are amortized over the terms of the policies. For
life policies, acquisition costs are amortized into income either over the premium-paying period of
the policies or the life of the policy, depending on the policy type.

Contingent Commission Accrual

Another significant estimate relates to the company’s accrual for contingent (profit-sharing)
commissions. Management bases the contingent commission accrual estimates on property casualty
underwriting results and on supplemental property casualty information. Contingent commissions are
paid to agencies using a formula that takes into account overall agency profitability and other
factors, such as prompt monthly payment of amounts due to the company. Due to the complexity of the
calculation and the variety of factors that can affect contingent commissions for an individual
agency, the amount accrued can differ from the actual contingent commissions paid. The contingent
commission accrual of $104 million in 2004 contributed 3.5 percentage points to the property
casualty combined ratio. If commissions paid were to vary from that amount by 5 percent, it would
affect 2005 net income by $3 million, or 2 cents per share, and the combined ratio by approximately
0.2 percentage points.

Separate Accounts

The company issues life contracts, referred to as bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLI).
Based on the specific contract provisions, the assets and liabilities for some BOLIs are legally
segregated and recorded as assets and liabilities of the separate accounts. Other BOLIs are
included in the general account. For separate account BOLIs, minimum investment returns and account
values are guaranteed by the company and also include death benefits to beneficiaries of the
contract holders.

Separate account assets are carried at fair value. Separate account liabilities primarily represent
the contract holders’ claims to the related assets and also are carried at the fair value of the
assets. Generally, investment income and realized investment gains and losses of the separate
accounts accrue directly to the contract holders and, therefore, are not included in the company’s
Consolidated Statements of Income. However, each separate account contract includes a negotiated
realized gain and loss sharing arrangement with the company. This share is transferred from the
separate account to the company’s general account and is recognized as revenue or expense. In the
event that the asset value of contract holders’ accounts is projected below the value guaranteed by
the company, a liability is established through a charge to the company’s earnings.

In the company’s most significant separate account written in 1999, realized gains and losses are
retained in the separate account and are deferred and amortized to the contract holder over a
five-year period, subject to certain limitations. Upon termination or maturity of this separate
account contract, any unamortized deferred gains and/or losses will revert to the general account.
In the event this separate account holder were to exchange the contract for the policy of another
carrier, there would be a surrender charge equal to 10 percent of the contract’s account value
during the first five years. Beginning in year six, the surrender charge decreases 2 percent a year
to 0 percent in year 11. At December 31, 2004, net unamortized realized losses amounted to $1
million. In accordance with this separate account agreement, the investment assets must meet
certain criteria established by the regulatory authorities to whose jurisdiction the group contract
holder is subject. Therefore, sales of investments may be mandated to maintain compliance with
these regulations, possibly requiring gains or losses to be recorded, and charged to the general
account. Potentially, losses could be material; however, unrealized losses at December 31, 2004, in
the separate account portfolio were less than $1 million.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 76, for information
regarding recent accounting pronouncements. Management has determined that recent accounting
pronouncements have not had nor are they expected to have any material impact on the company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R), which is a
revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25. Among
other items, SFAS No. 123(R) eliminates the use of APB Opinion No. 25 and the intrinsic value
method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of associate services received in
exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in
the financial statements. The effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) is the first reporting period
beginning after June 15, 2005, which is the third quarter of 2005 for the company, although early
adoption is allowed.

2004 10-K Page 29


SFAS No. 123(R) permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective or
a modified retrospective method. Under the modified prospective method, the compensation cost is
recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements
of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on the
requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS
No. 123(R). Under the modified retrospective method, the requirements are the same as under the
modified prospective method, but this method also permits companies to restate financial statements
of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made is accordance with SFAS No. 123. The
company currently utilizes a standard option-pricing model (binomial option-pricing model) to
measure the fair value of stock options granted to associates. While SFAS No. 123(R) permits
companies to continue to use such a model, the standard also permits the use of a lattice model.
The company has not yet determined which model it will use to measure the fair value of associate
stock options upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

The company currently expects to adopt SFAS 123(R) effective July 1, 2005; however, the company has
not yet determined which of the adoption methods it will use. Subject to a complete review of the
requirements of SFAS No. 123(R), based on stock options granted to associates through January 2005,
the company expects the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on July 1, 2005, will reduce both third quarter
and fourth quarter 2005 net income per share by approximately 2 cents per share.

In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified the consensus reached by the
Emerging Issues Task Force in Issue 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments and Its
Applications to Certain Investments” (EITF 03-1). The EITF reached a consensus on an
other-than-temporary impairment model for debt and equity securities accounted for under SFAS No.
115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and cost method
investments. The basic model developed to evaluate whether an investment within the scope of Issue
03-1 is other-than-temporarily impaired involves a three-step process including: determining
whether an investment is impaired (fair value less amortized cost); evaluating whether the
impairment is other-than-temporary; and requiring recognition of an impairment equal to the
difference between the investment’s cost and fair value.

In September 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. EITF Issue 03-1-1, “Effective Date of
Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-01.” This FSP delayed the effective date of the measurement
and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of Issue 03-1 and, as of February 25, 2005,
the FASB had not yet issued guidance on the adoption or effective date of FSP No. EITF Issue
03-1-1. The amount of any other-than-temporary impairment that may need to be recognized in the
future will be dependent on market conditions and management’s intent and ability to hold any such
impaired securities.

The consolidated results of operations reflect the operating results of each of the company’s
four segments along with parent company and other non-insurance activities. The four segments are:

•

Commercial lines property casualty insurance

•

Personal lines property casualty insurance

•

Life insurance

•

Investments operations

Highlights of the consolidated results for the past three years include:

Revenues – Revenue growth accelerated over the three-year period on strong property casualty
performance, continued growth in investment income and realized gains in 2004 versus realized
losses in 2003 and 2002. Earned premium growth slowed over the three years as commercial lines
pricing increases continued, but at a lower rate, and personal lines premium growth slowed,
primarily due to lower new business levels. The company’s emphasis on common stock holdings with an
increasing flow of dividend payments has led to continued growth of investment income. In addition,
the company allocated virtually 100 percent of new investment dollars to fixed-income securities
during most of 2004, adding to investment income growth.

Net income – Net income rose 56.0 percent in 2004 and 57.0 percent in 2003. In each of the past
three years, the company’s total benefits and expenses have grown less rapidly than revenues, as
management’s strategies to improve profitability have taken effect. Strong property casualty
underwriting profit in 2004 and 2003 led to a higher effective tax rate.

Book value – Book value was $37.38 at year-end 2004 up slightly from year-end 2003 as higher net
income was offset by lower unrealized investment gains.

Comprehensive income – Accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes the accumulated
unrealized gains on investments, declined by $297 million in 2004, gained $441 million in 2003 and
declined $470 million in 2002. See Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 13, for additional information
on the investment portfolio and see Shareholders’ Equity, Page 62, for information on unrealized
gains and losses. Return on equity improved for the third consecutive year while return on equity
based on comprehensive income was 4.6 percent in 2004 compared with 13.8 percent in 2003 and
negative 4.0 percent in 2002.

Other considerations – When evaluating ongoing business operations, management takes the following
into consideration:

•

Realized investment gains and losses – A significant factor in the growth rate of net
income in any year can be realized investment gains and losses. Management believes it is
important to carefully consider the impact of these gains and losses on net income when
evaluating the company’s primary business areas: property casualty insurance and life
insurance. Management believes the level of realized investment gains and losses for any
particular period, while it may be material, may obscure the performance of ongoing underlying
business operations in that period. While realized investment gains and losses are integral to the company’s insurance operations over the long
term, the determination to recognize gains or losses in any period may be subject to
management’s discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover,
under applicable accounting requirements, gains and losses can be recognized from certain
changes in market values of securities without actual realization.

In the three-year period, the after-tax impact of realized investment gains and losses was to
raise net income by $60 million, or 36 cents per share, in 2004. Realized investment gains and
losses reduced net income by $27 million, or 16 cents, in 2003, and by $62 million, or 36 cents,
in 2002. The company reported net realized investment gains in 2004 primarily because of the
sale of equity securities. Net realized investment losses were lower in 2003 than 2002 as
other-than-temporary impairment charges declined due to the economic and market

2004 10-K Page 31


Outlook

Over the long term, management’s objective is to achieve steady growth while performing as an
industry profitability leader. Based on its outlook for the insurance and investment markets and
its progress in implementing operating strategies, management has established certain performance
targets for 2005:

•

Property casualty written premium growth in the mid-single digits.
The company’s outlook is based on comments from various agencies
and production results, market intelligence from the company’s
field marketing representatives and account retention trends, as
well as staffing of new marketing territories and plans for new
agency appointments.

•

Combined ratio for the property casualty insurance operations in
the range of 91 percent, assuming catastrophe losses are a more
normal 3.5 percentage points on the combined ratio. Management
anticipates that the commercial lines combined ratio will be in
the range of 90 percent and the personal lines combined ratio will
be in the range of 95 percent, marking a return to profitability
for this segment. The consolidated target also assumes that
favorable loss reserve development will be in line with historical
levels.

•

Investment income growth of 5 percent to 6 percent pretax due in
part to the investment of a greater percentage of available cash
flow in fixed-income securities during most of 2004 and the first
half of 2005.

Management expects the impact of these anticipated strong operating results will be tempered in
2005 by the adoption of option expensing and slightly higher interest expense on long-term debt,
which increased modestly with the November 2004 issue of $375 million aggregate principal amount of
senior notes due 2034. The company will adopt SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” which calls
for stock option expense to be included as a component of net income, in the third quarter of 2005.
Pro forma option expense as disclosed in Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
Page 76, would have reduced earnings per share by 7 cents in both 2004 and 2003 and 8 cents in
2002.

A series of winter storms across the Midwest and Northeast during January 2005 caused approximately
$5 million in catastrophe losses for policyholders. As previously announced, management estimates
that first-quarter 2005 results will include an initial reserve of $22 million, net of reinsurance,
for a single large loss in January that was insufficiently covered through its facultative
reinsurance programs. Management’s performance targets for 2005 take these events into account.

Due to hurricane activity during 2004, management anticipates that there will be assessments for
windpools in Florida and other states. The company has received only preliminary information on
these potential assessments and at this time believes the potential impact of any assessment would
be immaterial.

Factors supporting management’s outlook for 2005 are discussed in the Results of Operations for
each of the four business segments.

2004 10-K Page 32


Segment Results of Operations

As described in Item 8, Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 89, management
measures profit or loss for its property casualty and life segments based upon underwriting
results. Insurance underwriting results (profit or loss) represent net earned premium less loss and
loss expenses and underwriting expenses on a pretax basis. Management also measures aspects of the
performance of its commercial lines and personal lines segments on a combined property casualty
insurance operations basis. Underwriting results and segment pretax operating income are not a
substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP.

For the combined property casualty insurance operations as well as the commercial lines and
personal lines segments, statutory accounting data and ratios are key performance indicators that
are used by management to assess business trends and to make comparisons to industry results, since
GAAP-based industry data generally is not readily available. Statutory accounting data and ratios
also are key performance indicators for The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company, the life insurance
subsidiary.

Investments held by the parent company and the related investment portfolios for the property
casualty and life insurance subsidiaries are managed and reported as the investments segment,
separate from the underwriting businesses. Net investment income and net realized investment gains
and losses for the company’s investment portfolios are discussed in the investments segment
discussion.

The following sections review results of operations for the combined property casualty insurance
operations and, separately, for each of the company’s four reportable segments (see Commercial
Lines Results of Operations, Page 35, Personal Lines Results of Operations, Page 40, Life Insurance
Results of Operations, Page 45, and Investments Results of Operations, Page 47).

Within the property casualty insurance market, the company offers both commercial and personal
policies through a network of independent agencies. Highlights of the performance for the combined
property casualty insurance operations included:

•

Earned premiums – Over the past three years, strong insurance industry pricing and its
relationships with independent agencies have permitted the company to obtain adequate premiums
on new and renewal business. The rate of increase for commercial lines earned premiums slowed
over the three-year period, reflecting changing market conditions, while the rate of increase
for personal lines earned premium reflected higher rates offset by declining new business
activity. To restore affected layers of property catastrophe reinsurance programs, the company
incurred $11 million in reinsurance reinstatement premiums in 2004, reducing net earned
premium growth by 0.4 percentage points.

The growth in earned premium reflected the competitive characteristics discussed in Item 1,
Property Casualty Insurance Operations, Page 1, including a case-by-case approach to new
business and account renewals. While insisting on adequate premiums for covered exposures, the
company continues to do business the way it always has; on the local level, focusing on each
relationship separately. Commercial lines pricing remained flexible to respond to each risk in
cooperation with local agents, who are in a position to know their market and their business.
The company believes that this approach results in more high-quality accounts over the long
term, further solidifies its relationships with independent agencies and establishes a basis for
continued growth.

o

Higher catastrophe loss ratio in 2004. Total catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance,
were $148 million for 2004 compared with $97 million in 2003 and $87 million in 2002. The
catastrophe losses contributed 5.1 percentage points to the property casualty combined
ratio in 2004 compared with 3.6 percentage points in 2003 and 2002.

o

Increase in the commission expense ratio. Commission expense rose more rapidly than
premiums primarily because of the company’s profit-sharing commission program.
Profit-sharing, or contingent, commissions are calculated on the profitability of an
agency’s aggregate book of business, taking into account longer-term profit, with a
percentage for prompt payment of premiums and other criteria. In 2004, profit sharing
commission expense contributed 3.5 percentage points, reflecting the substantial growth in
the underwriting profit to $298 million. In 2003, profit sharing commission expense
contributed 2.2 percentage points, reflecting the 2003 underwriting profit of $117 million
before the software recovery. In 2002, these commissions contributed 0.9 percentage points
to the combined ratio, as the company incurred a small underwriting profit.

o

Increase in the underwriting expense ratio. Underwriting expenses have risen more
rapidly than premiums due to higher salary expense, largely due to increases in
underwriting department staffing, and higher technology-related costs. The software
recovery reduced the 2003 underwriting expense ratio by 0.8 percentage points.

On a statutory basis, the 2004 property casualty combined ratio was 89.4 percent, including a
1.1 percentage-point benefit from the UM/UIM reserve release. The 2003 property casualty
statutory combined ratio of 95.0 percent before the software recovery, included a 1.4
percentage-point benefit from the UM/UIM reserve release, and compared with 99.6 percent in
2002, before the effect of Codification. The industry average statutory combined ratios are
estimated at 97.6 percent, 100.1 percent and 107.4 percent for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The favorable comparison of this key performance indicator to industry trends
highlights the success of the company’s strategies.

The discussion of the commercial lines and personal lines segments provides additional detail
regarding these strategies and trends.

Commercial Lines Results of Operations

Overview
– Three-year Highlights

Performance highlights for the commercial lines segment include:

•

Earned premiums – The primary source
of growth in the past three years has
been higher pricing on new and renewal
commercial business and
insurance-to-value initiatives, more
than offsetting the company’s
deliberate decisions not to write or
renew certain business and the loss of
some smaller accounts due to
competition. The reinsurance
reinstatement premiums allocated to
commercial lines reduced net earned
premium growth for 2004 by 0.3
percentage points. During this
three-year period, the company has
experienced little growth in overall
commercial lines policy counts. This
has reflected the company’s
re-underwriting of the existing book
of business and its insistence on
obtaining adequate premium for the
covered risks.

•

Profitability – Since 2002,
improvement in commercial lines
profitability has primarily been
driven by more adequate premiums per
policy as well as underwriting actions
taken. Results for 2004 also benefited
from higher than normal savings due to
favorable loss reserve development
from prior accident years, including
the benefit of the UM/UIM reserve
release, which reduced the ratio by
1.5 percentage points (see Property
Casualty Reserve Levels, Commercial
Lines Segment Reserves, Page 56, for
information regarding loss reserve
development for the commercial lines
segment). The 2003 combined ratio
included the benefits of the UM/UIM
reserve release and the software
recovery, which reduced the ratio by
2.0 percentage points and 0.8
percentage points, respectively.

Growth

In the seven states in which the company had at least $100 million in commercial lines agency
direct earned premiums in 2004, premiums were $1.320 billion in 2004. In these states, premiums
grew 10.0 percent in 2004. In the remaining 24 states, agency direct earned premiums were $905
million in 2004. In these states, premiums rose 15.2 percent in 2004. The stronger growth rate in
the smaller states reflected the opportunities available to the company in less penetrated markets.

Management considers new business measures to be a key indicator of the success of its competitive
strategies. Locally based field marketing representatives lead the new business effort, working
with agencies to underwrite and price business using personal and direct knowledge of the risk and
competitive environment. In 2004, commercial lines new business premiums written directly by
agencies rose 5.2 percent to a record $282 million due to strong new business trends in the first
half of the year. In 2003, commercial new business premiums rose 6.8 percent to $268 million. In
2002, new business premiums rose 14.4 percent to $251 million. The lower 2004 and 2003 growth rates
reflected the company’s pricing discipline. The growth rate in 2004 also reflected the slowing of
premium increases industrywide.

Profitability

In addition to seeking more adequate premium per exposure over the past three years, the
company has focused on longer-term efforts to enhance profitability. These have included
identifying the exposures the company has for each risk and making sure it offers appropriate
coverages, terms and conditions and limits of insurance. The company continues to develop new
underwriting guidelines, to re-underwrite books of business with selected agencies and to update
policy terms and conditions, where necessary. In addition, the company continues to leverage its strong local presence. Field
marketing representatives have met with every agency to reaffirm agreements on the extent of
frontline

2004 10-K Page 35


renewal underwriting to be performed by local agencies. Loss control, machinery and
equipment and field claims representatives have been conducting on-site inspections. Field claims
representatives prepare full risk reports on every account reporting a loss above $100,000 or on
any risk of concern. Multi-departmental task forces have implemented programs to address concerns
for specific areas such as contractor and commercial auto risks. These actions have helped to
address rising loss severity.

The significant components of expenses for the commercial lines segment are described below.

Loss and Loss Expenses (excluding catastrophe losses)

Loss and loss expenses include both net paid losses and reserve additions for unpaid losses as
well as the associated loss expenses. As a result of the underwriting actions noted above, which
have led to higher premiums on a relatively stable level of exposure, loss and loss expenses
excluding catastrophes declined over the three-year period. A primary reason for the improvement in
the ratio between 2004 and 2003 was higher than normal savings due to favorable loss reserve
development from prior accident years (see Property Casualty Reserve Levels, Commercial Lines
Segment Reserves, Page 56, for information regarding loss reserve development for the commercial
lines segment). The favorable development was largely due to the claims department’s initiative,
begun in 2001, to establish higher initial case reserves on liability claims in the period when the
claim is reported. UM/UIM reserve releases contributed 1.5 percentage points to the loss and loss
expense ratio in 2004 and 2.0 percentage points in 2003.

Management monitors incurred losses by size of loss, business line, risk category, geographic
region, agency, field marketing territory and duration of policyholder relationship, addressing
concentrations or trends as needed. Analysis indicated no significant concentrations beyond that
seen in higher loss ratios for certain business lines, which management believes it has addressed.
Management also measures new losses and case reserve adjustments greater than $250,000 to track
frequency and severity. New losses greater than $1 million, new losses between $250,000 and $1
million and case reserve increases greater than $250,000, declined as a percentage of earned
premiums in each of the past three years.

Commission Expenses

Commission expense as a percent of earned premium rose by 1.0 percentage points in 2004 and
0.6 percentage points in 2003 as contingent (profit-based) commissions increased because of strong
recent results. The company relies on its independent agencies as frontline underwriters who know
the businesses and individuals in their communities.

Underwriting Expenses

Non-commission expenses rose to 9.4 percent of earned premium in 2004 from 7.7 percent in 2003
and 2002. The increase in 2004 reflected higher salary expense and technology-related costs
partially offset by continued refinements in the company’s cost allocation processes between
commercial lines and personal lines. In 2003 the ratio of underwriting expenses to earned premiums
was reduced by 0.8 percentage points due to the software recovery.

Policyholder Dividends

Policyholder dividend expense was 0.5 percent of earned premium in 2004 compared with 0.8
percent in 2003 and 0.3 percent in 2002.

In total the commercial multi-peril, workers compensation, commercial auto and other liability
lines of business accounted for 90.1 percent of total commercial lines earned premium compared with
90.5 percent in 2003 and 90.5 percent in 2002. Approximately 95 percent of the company’s commercial
lines premiums are written as packages, providing accounts with coverages from more than one
business line. The company believes that its commercial lines area is best measured and evaluated
on a segment basis. For reference, however, the table above and discussion below summarizes growth
and profitability trends separately for each of the four primary business lines.

The accident year loss data provides current estimates of accident year incurred loss and loss
expenses for the past five years. Accident year data shows the year in which loss events occurred,
regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid.

Over the past three years, results for the business lines within the commercial lines segment have
reflected the company’s emphasis on underwriting and obtaining adequate pricing for the covered
risk, as discussed above. Additional detail regarding reserve development is provided in Property
Casualty Reserve Levels, Commercial Lines Segment Reserves, Page 56.

Commercial Multi-peril

The company wrote a higher than normal number of one-year policies in 2002 pending regulatory
approval for changes in policy terms and conditions (see Item 1, Commercial Lines Segment, Page 9,
for a discussion of one- and three-year policies). In addition to industrywide slowing in premium
growth, this decision decelerated the 2003 growth rate for the company’s commercial multi-peril
business line as some liability coverages previously written in premium discounted packages were
moved to non-discounted policies in 2003. Many non-discounted policies are included in the
company’s other liability line of business.

The loss and loss expense ratio declined steadily over the three-year period. Commercial
multi-peril is the company’s single largest business line, and management believes this business
line’s loss data are the best indicators of the success of the growth and underwriting actions that
have been implemented in the past three years. The 2004 calendar year ratio improved even though
catastrophe losses were slightly higher than 2003 and $4 million in

2004 10-K Page 38


liability reserve strengthening in 2004 offset the improvement by 0.6 percentage points. Higher general liability base rates were
effective in most states during 2003. This contributed to further improvement in the loss and loss
expense ratio in 2004 and 2003. Reserve strengthening increased the ratio by 2.0 percentage points
in 2003 and 1.0 percentage points in 2002.

Workers Compensation

Conditions within the workers compensation market remained stable in 2004 after improving
between 1999 and 2003 as market pricing rose in most states, albeit offset by continued rising
trends in loss severity. As indicated by the rapid rise in premium volume of state pools for
workers compensation, many carriers chose to exit significant portions of this line of business.
While the company remains highly selective about the risks covered, workers compensation is
available as part of package policies for commercial lines policyholders, maintaining the company’s
competitive position in selected states. Workers compensation has a lower commission ratio and
higher breakeven point than the other commercial business lines.

Growth in 2004 was primarily due to higher rates. In 2003 and 2002 the company chose not to renew
selected policies where it believed the aggregate terrorism exposure risk was excessive. Any new or
renewal policy covering 200 or more employees at any one location received added scrutiny as the
company sought to manage risk aggregation. On the basis of new business premiums written directly
by agents, new workers compensation premiums increased 18.8 percent in 2004 and 5.9 percent in 2003
after declining 17.4 percent in 2002. Total workers compensation earned premiums were unchanged
between 2003 and 2002 as rate increases offset a decline in policy count due to the re-underwriting
effort.

The workers compensation loss and loss expense ratio has been steady for three years. Overall
pricing increases for new and renewed risks and underwriting actions have helped stabilize the
accident year loss ratio in the mid-70 percent range for the most recent three years compared with
the higher level of 2000 and 2001. The loss and loss expense ratio reflected $16 million in reserve
strengthening in 2004, primarily due to medical cost trends, $13 million in 2003 and $9 million in
2002.

Commercial Auto

Commercial auto premium growth trends reflected the factors influencing overall commercial
lines performance, with the primary driver being price increases. Commercial auto, one of the
commercial lines coverage areas for which the company prices coverage on an annual basis,
frequently is one of the first lines to experience pricing pressure because it often represents the
largest portion of insurance costs for commercial policyholders.

In the past several years, the company accelerated efforts to improve commercial auto underwriting
and rate levels, making certain that vehicle use was properly classified. As a result of those
actions and moderating industry-wide severity and frequency trends, the loss and loss expense ratio
for commercial auto improved in each of the past three years. Further, new and revised underwriting
guidelines are being used to assure accurate classification and pricing. The UM/UIM reserve
releases had their most substantial impact on the commercial auto line, lowering the 2004 loss and
loss expense ratio by 4.6 percentage points and the 2003 loss and loss expense ratio by 6.9
percentage points. Including the UM/UIM reserve releases in 2004 and 2003, the 2004 ratio benefited
10.5 percentage points from higher than normal savings due to favorable loss reserve development
from prior accident years, the 2003 ratio benefited by 8.8 percentage points and the 2002 ratio
benefited by 4.0 percentage points.

Other Liability

Earned premium growth for the other liability line (commercial umbrella, commercial general
liability and most executive risk policies) continued at a higher pace in 2004 because of the
number of policies written in non-discounted programs and the continuing rise in liability pricing.
The other liability policy count has been stable as growth in the number of non-discounted policies
has offset declines in other areas, in part due to a change that allowed umbrella coverages to be
endorsed to a primary policy rather than be written separately.

Director and officer coverage accounted for approximately 13 percent of other liability premium in
2004 and approximately 12 percent in 2003. Director and officer policies are offered primarily to
non-profit organizations, reducing the risk associated with this line of business. As of December
31, 2004, only four in-force director and officer policies were for Fortune 500 companies.
Forty-two were for publicly traded companies (excluding banks and savings and loans) and 70 were
for banks and savings and loans with more than $500 million in assets.

In large part because this business line includes umbrella coverages, the calendar year loss and
loss expense ratio tends to fluctuate dramatically on a year-over-year basis. The improvement in
the 2004 calendar year loss and loss expense ratio was driven by 2000 through 2003 accident year
loss and loss expense ratios 6.5 to 14.7 percentage points below their year-ago levels.

The 2004 ratio benefited by 32.5 percentage points due to higher than normal savings due to
favorable loss reserve development from prior accident years, including 2.0 percentage points from
UM/UIM reserve releases. The 2003 ratio benefited by 23.0 percentage points due to favorable
development, including 2.6 percentage points due to UM/UIM reserve releases. The 2002 ratio
benefited by 8.8 percentage points from favorable development.

2004 10-K Page 39


Commercial Lines Outlook

Industry experts currently anticipate industry-wide commercial lines written premiums will
decline approximately 1 percent in 2005. The company anticipates commercial lines insurance market
trends will reflect accelerated competition in 2005 with pressure on pricing from the industry’s
increasing surplus and improving profitability. During the second half of 2004, agents indicated
that renewal price increases were running in the low single digits, with variations by geographic
region, class of business and size of account. Aggressive pricing is occurring more frequently for
higher quality and for larger accounts although disciplined underwriting appears to be the norm.
The company will continue to market its products to a broad range of business classes, price its
products adequately and take a package approach. The company intends to maintain its underwriting
selectively and to manage carefully its rate levels as well as maintain its programs that seek to
accurately match exposures with appropriate premium. The creation of new marketing territories and
appointment of new agencies over the next several years also could contribute to commercial lines
growth. As a result of these factors, management presently anticipates 2005 commercial lines written premium growth in the mid-single
digits compared with 7.6 percent in 2004.

The company believes it can continue to be a preferred market for its agencies and the types of
Main Street businesses they serve by evaluating each risk individually and making decisions
regarding rates, the use of three-year policies and other policy terms on a case-by-case basis,
even in lines and classes of business that are under competitive pressure. This should allow the
company to maintain the positive underlying improvements in profitability that have occurred over
the past several years, but management does not believe favorable reserve development will
contribute as much in 2005 as it did in 2004. As a result, management currently is estimating a
2005 commercial lines combined ratio in the range of 90 percent compared with 84.1 percent in 2004.

Personal Lines Results of Operations

Overview
– Three-year Highlights

Performance highlights for the personal lines segment include:

•

Earned premiums – The primary source of
growth in the past three years was rate
increases to address premium
inadequacy. Rate increases on new and
renewal business have offset a decline
in policy count in each year. The
reinsurance reinstatement premiums
allocated to personal lines reduced net
earned premium growth for 2004 by 0.8
percentage points.

•

Combined ratio – Over the past three
years, the combined ratio has reflected
an improving loss and loss expense
ratio excluding catastrophe losses. In
2004, the improvement in the loss and
loss expense ratio was offset by higher
catastrophe losses and rising
commission and underwriting expenses
over the entire period. In 2003, the
improvement also reflected a 2.4
percentage-point decline in the
underwriting expense ratio, of which
1.1 percentage-points were due to the
software cost recovery.

Growth

Personal lines is an important component of the company’s overall relationship with many of
its agencies and an important component of agency relationships with their clients.

In the seven states in which the company wrote $35 million or more in personal lines agency direct
earned premiums in 2004, premiums were $621 million in 2004. In these states, premiums grew 6.4
percent in 2004. In the 15 states with less than $35 million in premiums in 2004, agency direct
earned premiums grew more rapidly, rising 10.7 percent in 2004 to $194 million. Similar to
commercial lines, the stronger growth in the smaller states reflected the opportunities available
to the company in less penetrated markets.

Personal lines new business premiums written directly by agencies declined 19.9 percent to $48
million in 2004 and 9.3 percent to $60 million in 2003 from a 2002 high of $67 million. The decline
in new business in 2004 and 2003 reflected the company’s emphasis on underwriting personal lines
and factors specific to the personal auto and homeowner business lines, as discussed below. In
addition, agencies may be placing less new business with the company until the introduction of
Diamond, the new personal lines policy processing system, in their state. Further, the company now
understands that the agency learning curve for Diamond may be steeper than anticipated, potentially
reducing agency attention to new business efforts in the initial months after the system is
introduced in their state.

Profitability

Efforts to improve personal lines profitability have focused on the personal auto and
homeowner business lines as discussed below. The significant components of expenses for the
personal lines segment are described below.

Loss and Loss Expenses (excluding catastrophe losses)

Loss and loss expenses include both net paid losses and reserve additions for unpaid losses as
well as the associated loss expenses. For personal lines, loss and loss expenses excluding
catastrophes were $522 million in 2004 compared with $524 million in 2003 and $487 million in 2002.
Loss and loss expenses for personal lines have reflected the industrywide rise in loss severity
over the past several years due to escalating medical costs and home values offset by the benefits
of underwriting actions and changes in policy terms and conditions. In addition, the loss and loss
expense ratio benefited from higher than normal savings due to favorable loss reserve development
from prior accident years (see Property Casualty Reserve Levels, Personal Lines Segment Reserves,
Page 58, for information regarding loss reserve development for the personal lines segment).

Management monitors incurred losses by size of loss, business line, risk category, geographic
region, agency, field marketing territory and duration of policyholder relationship, addressing
concentrations or trends as needed. Analysis indicated no significant concentrations beyond that
seen in higher loss ratios for certain business lines, which management believes it has addressed.
Management also measures new losses and case reserve adjustments greater than $250,000 to track
frequency and severity. For personal lines, losses greater than $1 million and losses between
$250,000 and $1 million have stabilized as a percentage of earned premiums. Case reserve increases
greater than $250,000 rose as a percentage of earned premiums in 2004 after declining in 2003.
Management remains focused on establishing adequate case reserves at the time a claim is reported.

Commission Expenses

Commission expense as a percent of earned premium rose by 0.6 percentage points in 2004 and
0.5 percentage points in 2003 as total contingent (profit-based) commissions rose.

Underwriting Expenses

Over the three-year period, non-commission expenses fluctuated as a percent of earned
premiums, but rose to a three-year high of 9.3 percent in 2004 due to higher salary expense and
high technology-related costs. In 2003 the ratio of underwriting expenses to earned premiums was
reduced by 1.1 percentage points due to the software recovery. The fluctuation in the expense ratio
was partially due to continued refinements in the company’s cost allocation processes between
commercial lines and personal lines.

The personal auto and homeowner business lines together accounted for 89.5 percent, 89.5
percent and 89.4 percent of total personal lines earned premiums in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The company’s intent is to write personal auto and homeowners coverages in personal
lines packages. As a result, management believes that personal lines is best measured and evaluated
on a segment basis. For reference, however, the table above and discussion below summarizes growth
and profitability trends for the personal auto and homeowner business lines. Information regarding
reserve development is provided in Property Casualty Reserve Levels, Personal Lines Segment
Reserves, Page 58.

The accident year loss data provides current estimates of accident year incurred loss and loss
expenses for the past five years. Accident year data shows the year in which loss events occurred,
regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid.

Personal Auto

Earned premiums for personal auto grew 5.4 percent, 9.8 percent and 7.9 percent in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. The growth was driven by the effect of rate increases beginning in late
2002. During 2004, rate increases in the range of 1.6 percent to 10.0 percent became effective in
21 states. Once rate changes become effective, they are applied to new business and to existing
policies as they come up for renewal. Management believes the company’s personal auto rates generally remain competitive.

Over the last three years, the benefits of personal auto re-underwriting programs and higher
pricing have generally served to offset rising loss severity. For selected agencies, the programs
reviewed and strengthened underwriting standards, required motor vehicle reports for many insured
drivers and developed strategies to increase the company’s penetration of the agency’s personal
lines business. The loss and loss expense ratio for personal auto improved to 66.1 percent in 2004
from 71.1 percent in 2003 and 67.6 percent in 2002. The 2002 ratio included a 5.0 percentage-point benefit from the salvage and subrogation reserve.

Homeowner

Earned premiums for homeowners grew 8.2 percent, 14.0 percent and 10.0 percent in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively, primarily because of rate increases that began to take effect in 2002. The
loss and loss expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses for the homeowner line declined to 69.3
percent in 2004 from 72.8 percent in 2003 and 78.3 percent in 2002 due to the company’s program to
improve homeowner profitability. Catastrophe losses contributed 26.8 percentage points, 19.9
percentage points and 20.3 percentage points to the homeowner loss and loss expense ratio in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Management continues to seek to improve homeowner results so that this
line achieves profitability in 2006. For this measurement, management is presuming commission and
underwriting expenses would contribute approximately 29 percentage points to a homeowner combined
ratio. The target also assumes that premium growth will lead to catastrophe losses as a percent of
homeowner earned premium in the range of 17 percent. However, over the past three years,
catastrophe losses have been approximately 22 percent on the same basis.

In mid-2004, the company began modifying its policy terms to change homeowner policy earthquake
deductibles to 10 percent from 5 percent in selected Midwestern states, reducing the company’s
exposure to a single significant

2004 10-K Page 43


catastrophic event. See Item 1, Financial Strength Ratings, Page 7, for discussion of the company’s strategy to support the financial strength ratings of its
property casualty insurance operations.

The three most significant actions taken since 2003 to improve profitability for the homeowner line
are summarized below. Management believes that the homeowner line will be profitable in 2006.
However, it will take into 2007 for the full benefit of these actions to be reflected in homeowner
results.

•

Rate changes — In 2004, rate increases in the range of 3.0 percent
to 25.8 percent became effective in 22 states. In four of the
company’s six largest homeowner states, 2004 increases were in the
8 percent to 18 percent range. Once rate changes become effective,
they are applied to new business and to existing policies as they
come up for renewal. In 2003, 23 rate increases were effective in
21 of the 25 states in which the company writes homeowners
policies.

•

Changes in policy terms and conditions — The company has
identified specific coverages for updating to increase its control
over risk and pricing, including capping replacement cost coverage
for most policies and changing the water damage coverages. These
changes began to go into effect over the past 24 months as
policies have renewed and new business has been written. By the
end of 2005, virtually all of the company’s homeowner policies
will have the new terms and conditions.

•

Shift to one-year policies — In conjunction with the deployment of
Diamond, the personal lines policy processing system, the company
has begun to write homeowner policies on a one-year term instead
of a three-year term.
One-year policies allow the company to modify rates, terms and conditions more promptly, when

necessary. The company has moved to one-year homeowner policies in Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin. The company plans
for homeowner policies written in other states to shift to a one-year term in advance of the
Diamond deployment for each specific state. At the end of 2004, management estimates that
approximately 27 percent of homeowner policies now have been written on a one-year term.

The benefits of changes in rates and policy terms and conditions has been deferred because the
company traditionally has written homeowner business on a three-year policy term and
approximately one-third of policies come up for renewal each year. For example, in Ohio, which
accounted for 32.0 percent of the company’s 2004 total homeowner earned premiums, typical 2005
homeowner renewal policies are experiencing approximately a 40 percent increase in total
premium. The increase demonstrates the cumulative effect of rate changes, insured value and
policy changes that were effected by the company over the policyholders’ most recent three-year
term.

Personal Lines Outlook

In the personal lines marketplace, the company believes agents select Cincinnati for their
value-oriented clients who seek to balance value and price and are attracted by Cincinnati’s
superior claims service and the benefits of the company’s package approach. However, management is
maintaining modest expectations for the personal lines area and anticipates mid-single digit
written premium growth in 2005. Industry experts currently anticipate industry-wide personal lines
written premiums will rise approximately 4.5 percent in 2005.

Six factors are contributing to management’s growth expectations:

•

Timing — The company implemented
homeowner rate increases in its larger
states in late 2003 and early 2004. As a
result, the impact of these rate changes
will accumulate into 2007, because
approximately one-third of the
three-year policies written before late
2003 come up for renewal each year.

•

Rate levels — The company continues to
work with its agents to refine the
current rate structure to bring
homeowner profitability in line with
personal auto results and establish
prices that attract agencies’ quality
accounts. Management believes homeowner
rate increases instituted in the past 24
months generally established pricing
above the mid-point of market rates. As
a result, current rates in some areas
may be at a level that diminishes a
differentiating factor for more
price-sensitive consumers. In addition,
the rate of increase for policies
renewing for the first time in three
years can be significant, as discussed
above, even if the result is a
competitive price. In a number of its
field territories, management believes
rates may be too high and it continues
to evaluate independent agent market
intelligence for potential refinements
to the rate structure.

•

Policy characteristics — In keeping with
industry practices and as noted above,
the company’s homeowner policies now
include specific charges for optional
coverages previously included at no
charge, such as water damage coverage.
This change can be an advantage for
policyholders because it allows them to
select the amount of coverage to meet
their needs. However, this change also
may have diminished a differentiating
factor for the company’s products in the
marketplace.

•

Underwriting — Personal lines
underwriters are focusing on
insurance-to-value initiatives to verify
that policyholders are buying the
correct level of coverage for the value
of the insured risk. In addition, the
company is carefully maintaining its
underwriting standards to help achieve
the return to profitability.

•

Diamond introduction — The transition to
the Diamond system of agencies writing
in total almost 60 percent of personal
lines volume is a significant
accomplishment. However, the company now
understands that the agency

2004 10-K Page 44


learning
curve for Diamond may be steeper than
anticipated, potentially reducing agency
attention to new business efforts.
Longer-term, management believes this
program could have a substantial
positive benefit on premium growth as
the technology presents solutions sought
by independent agencies.

Management believes the new system will ultimately make it easier for agents to place personal
auto, homeowners and other personal lines business with the company, while greatly increasing
policy-issuance and policy-renewal efficiency and providing direct-bill capabilities. Agents
using Diamond chose direct bill for 39 percent of the policies and headquarters policy printing
for 72 percent of the policies in 2004, options that generally were not available on the
company’s previous system.

•

New agencies — The appointment of new agencies over the next several years also should
contribute to personal lines growth.

These factors may affect the personal lines growth rate, however, management believes that they
will allow the company to improve the profitability of its homeowner line of business while
maintaining personal auto profitability. While primarily focusing on longer-term targets for the homeowner line
because of the existing base of three-year policies, management believes the overall personal lines
combined ratio will be in the range of 95 percent for 2005 as the company continues to work through
the renewal policy cycle and assuming catastrophe losses within normal parameters.

Life Insurance Results of Operations

Overview — Three-year Highlights

Performance highlights for the life insurance segment include:

•

Revenues — Revenue growth has
accelerated over the past three years
as the company increased life policy
face amounts in force to $44.921
billion at year-end 2004 from $38.492
billion at year-end 2003 and $32.486
billion at year-end 2002.

•

Profitability — The life insurance
segment reports a small GAAP-based
segment profit because investment
income is included in investment
segment results, except investment
income credited to contract holders
(interest assumed in life insurance
policy reserve calculations). Results
improved in 2004 and 2003 because
operating expenses remained level and
mortality experience remained within
pricing guidelines as premiums
continued to rise.

At the same time, management recognizes that assets under management, capital appreciation and
investment income are integral to evaluation of the success of the life insurance segment
because of the long duration of life products. For that reason, management also evaluates GAAP
data including results for investment activities on life insurance-related assets for The
Cincinnati Life Insurance Company subsidiary, which comprises the life insurance segment.
Looking at a key performance indicator for Cincinnati Life, GAAP net income grew 74.1 percent in
2004 to $38 million compared with 25.8 percent in 2003 to $22 million. The life insurance
portfolio had pretax realized investment gains of $9 million in 2004 compared with $10 million
and $11 million of pretax realized investment losses in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Growth

Cincinnati Life offers whole, term and universal life products, fixed annuities and disability
income products. Revenues in 2004 were derived principally from:

•

Premiums from traditional products, principally term insurance, which contributed 71.7 percent

•

Fee income from interest-sensitive products, principally universal life insurance, which contributed 25.4 percent

•

Separate account investment management fee income, which contributed 2.9 percent

The company’s life insurance subsidiary reported 2004 statutory written life premium of $118
million, which included the sale of two general account BOLI policies totaling $10 million,
compared with $102 million in 2003, which included no BOLI sales. Statutory written premiums have
been reclassified to exclude annuity deposits not involving life contingencies, which are not
recognized as written premium under statutory rules. Annuity sales were $71 million in 2004
compared with $37 million in 2003 and $85 million in 2002. The growth in 2004 annuity sales was
attributable to attractive fixed rates and guaranteed income features.

In 2004, the company’s life insurance segment experienced a 3.5 percent rise in applications
submitted and a 10.7 percent increase in face amount issued due to continued strong sales of term
insurance marketed through the company’s property casualty agency force. Management believes market
pressures are mitigated for the life insurance company because of its association with the property
casualty operations, its leverage of the property casualty agency franchise and its careful
selection of independent agencies. Within this marketplace, Cincinnati Life is able to be
competitive and attracts its share of business from the property casualty agencies with which the
company has strong relationships.

2004 10-K Page 45


Over the past several years, the life insurance company has worked to introduce a portfolio of new
and enhanced products, primarily under the LifeHorizons name. For example, during 2003, the company
introduced a new guaranteed whole life policy and a non-cancelable rider for its disability income
product.

In 2004, Cincinnati Life continued to enhance the LifeHorizons portfolio of products to meet
changing needs of both consumers and agencies. Product development centers on mortality-oriented
products combined with contract guarantees. Distribution expansion into western and northeastern
states is a high priority. Management has added a life field marketing representative for the
western states and plans to add a representative for the northeastern states in 2005. During 2004,
Cincinnati Life added a disability income product to its worksite marketing portfolio.

Profitability

Life segment expenses consist principally of:

•

Insurance benefits paid and reserve increases,
related to traditional life and
interest-sensitive products, which accounted for
64.3 percent of 2004 expenses

•

Commissions, general and other business
expenses, net of deferred acquisition costs,
accounted for 35.7 percent of 2004 expenses

Segment profitability depends largely on premium levels, the adequacy of product pricing,
underwriting skill and operating efficiencies. Life segment results include only investment
interest credited to contract holders (interest assumed in life insurance policy reserve
calculations). The remaining investment income is reported in the investment segment results. The
life investment portfolio is managed to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on
general account assets and rates credited to policyholders. Management considers the amount of
assets under management and investment income for the life investment portfolio as key performance
indicators for the life insurance segment.

The life insurance company seeks to maintain a competitive advantage with respect to benefits paid
and reserve increases by consistently achieving better than average claims experience due to
skilled underwriting. Commissions paid by the life insurance operation are on par with industry
averages. During the past three years, the company has invested in imaging and workflow technology.
As a result, the efficiency of application processing has improved significantly. During this
period, submitted applications have increased at an annualized rate of approximately 6 percent,
while staff involved with the underwriting and policy issue has declined 5 percent. This has been
accomplished while maintaining the company’s service standards.

Acquisition costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business, are
deferred and recorded as an asset. The company generally limits the expenses capitalized to the
lower of the expense assumptions used in pricing or the actual deferrable costs. The deferred
acquisition cost is amortized into income in proportion to different measures depending on the
policy type. The company regularly reviews and, as appropriate, changes (unlocks) the assumptions
used to calculate deferred acquisition costs for universal life contracts. The 2004 unlocking
pertained primarily to assumptions regarding asset defaults and mortality. 2004 unlocking
assumptions reduced deferred acquisition cost amortization by $4 million and deferred revenue
amortization by $1 million.

Life Insurance Outlook

As the life insurance company seeks to increase penetration of the property casualty agencies,
management’s objective is to increase premiums and maintain expenses. Management continues to
emphasize the cross-serving opportunities afforded by worksite marketing life insurance products.
In 2005, management is exploring additional programs to simplify the worksite marketing sales
process for independent property casualty agencies, including enrollment software. Term insurance
is the company’s largest life insurance product line. Changes in the marketplace during 2004 have
affected the cost and availability of reinsurance for term life insurance for 2005. The company
currently is researching alternative reinsurance solutions to help fund the statutory reserve
strain on new term business. Management believes it will be able to structure a reinsurance program
that provides the life insurance company with the ability to continue to grow in the term life
insurance marketplace while appropriately managing risk, at a cost that allows the company to
achieve its profit targets.

Investments Results of Operations

Overview
– Three-year Highlights

The investment segment contributes investment income and realized gains and losses to results
of operations. Investments provide the company’s primary source of pretax and after-tax profits.

•

Investment income - Pretax investment income reached a new record
of $492 million in 2004, rising 5.7 percent from the prior record
in 2003. Growth in investment income over the past two years has
been driven by strong cash flow for new investments, higher
interest income from the growing fixed-income portfolio and
increased dividend income from the common stock portfolio.

•

Realized gains and losses - The company reported realized gains in
2004 compared with realized losses in 2003 and 2002. Realized
losses were substantially lower in 2003 than 2002 as fewer
other-than-temporary impairment charges were recorded due to the
economic and market recovery.

Investment Income

The advantages of strong cash flow in the past three years have been somewhat offset by the
challenge of investing in a low interest rate environment. The allocation of new investment dollars
to fixed-income securities during most of 2004 added to investment income growth. Overall, common
stock dividends contributed 48.6 percent of pretax investment income in 2004 compared with 48.8
percent in 2003 and 46.9 percent in 2002. In 2004, 33 of the 51 common stock holdings in the
portfolio raised their indicated dividend payout, as did 29 of 51 in 2003 and 28 of the 46 in 2002.
The 2004 increases should add approximately $15 million to investment income on an annualized
basis. Fifth Third, the company’s largest equity holding, contributed 58.8 percent of the increase
and 39.9 percent of total dividend income in 2004.

Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses

Over the past three years, net realized investment gains and losses have been made up of
other-than-temporary impairment charges, realized investment gains and losses on the sale of
securities and changes in the valuation of embedded derivatives within certain convertible
securities. These three areas are discussed below:

Other-than-temporary Impairment Charges

In 2004, the company recorded $6 million in write-downs of investments that management deemed
had experienced an other-than-temporary decline in market value versus $80 million in 2003 and $98
million in 2002. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Asset Impairment, Page 27, for
factors considered by management. These other-than-temporary impairment charges represented 0.1
percent, 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent of total invested assets at year-end 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Also included in other-than-temporary impairments are unrealized losses of holdings
that the company has identified for sale but not yet completed a transaction.

Other-than-temporary impairment charges declined significantly in 2004 due to prior impairments in
the portfolio and an improvement in the general financial climate. During the three-year period,
almost 90
percent of the write-downs of securities that management deemed had experienced
other-than-temporary declines in market value occurred during 2002 and the first half of 2003.
During that earlier period, lingering weakness in the economy affected market values. Of the $80
million in other-than-temporary write-downs in 2003, $69 million occurred in the first six months
of the year.

The write-down of two airline-related tax-exempt municipal bonds totaling $5 million accounted for
the majority of other-than-temporary impairment charges in 2004. The majority of the write-downs in
2003 related to 31 high-yield corporate bonds written down $39 million and 10 convertible
securities written down $26 million. Unlike 2002, the market value declines in 2003 were related to
company-specific events rather than industry issues.

2004 10-K Page 47


The impairment of $5 million of airline-related bonds in 2004 was a marked reduction from the prior
two years, primarily because of the stabilization or improvement in the market value of previously
impaired bonds and the disposition of airline-related securities in previous years. Over the past
three years, other-than-temporary impairments of airline-related bonds as well as sales of
securities reduced the company’s exposure to this industry to approximately $36 million at year-end
2004, down from $140 million at year-end 2001. The company did not write down any utility/merchant
energy/trading securities in 2004 due to a healthier credit climate and the previous disposal of
securities. In 2002 and 2003, valuations throughout that industry were affected by mismanagement of
trading operations and accounting irregularities regarding the booking of revenues and the
valuation of trading contracts. The company did not write down any healthcare securities in 2004.
The 2003 healthcare impairment charges related primarily to the sudden default by Healthsouth
Corporation and subsequent fraud charges. These securities have since recovered and all coupon
payments have been made.

Other-than temporary impairment charges from the investment portfolio by asset class (see Item 1,
Investments Segment, Page 13, for a description of the five asset classes) are summarized below:

Realized Investment Gains and Losses

In 2004, the company recorded $87 million in net realized investment gains, primarily due to
the sale of equity holdings, compared with $30 million in 2003 and $8 million in 2002. The company
buys and sells securities on an ongoing basis to help achieve its portfolio objectives. Although
the company prefers to hold fixed-income securities until maturity, a decision to sell reflects
management’s perception of a change in the underlying fundamentals of the security and preference
to allocate those funds to investments that more closely meet the established parameters for
long-term stability and growth. Management’s opinion that a security fundamentally no longer meets
the company’s investment expectations may reflect a loss of confidence in the issuer’s management,
a change in underlying risk factors (such as political risk, regulatory risk, sector risk or credit
risk), or a recovery from a previously impaired value. In 2004 and 2003, the company sold
fixed-income securities that it deemed to have limited upside potential.

During 2004, the company sold $356 million in equity holdings as part of a program to support the
financial strength ratings of its property casualty insurance operations (see Item 1, Financial
Strength Ratings, Page 7, for discussion of this program). Holdings to be sold were selected
primarily based on the investment committee and management’s belief that these securities would
have a lower dividend growth rate over the next several years when compared with other holdings in
the portfolio. Management also considered the potential tax effect of any unrealized gains. Partial
sales of holdings that were over $100 million in assets at year-end 2003 contributed $311 million.
As a result, the company now has 14 holdings over $100 million compared with 15 a year ago. Sales
of smaller holdings that the company often uses as trading vehicles or had already targeted for
sale contributed the remainder of the $356 million. The company also realized $21 million in gains
from the sale of previously impaired securities.

Change in the Valuation of Embedded Derivatives

In 2004, the company recorded $10 million in fair value increases compared with $9 million in
fair value increases in 2003 and $4 million in fair value declines in 2002 due to the application
of SFAS No. 133, which requires measurement of the fluctuations in the value of the embedded
derivative features in selected convertible securities. See Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Page 76, for details on the accounting for convertible security embedded
options.

Investments Outlook

Management believes that it will achieve pretax investment income growth of 5 percent to 6
percent in 2005 as a result of the anticipated growth in dividend income, the potential rise in
interest rates, strong cash flow from insurance operations and the higher-than-normal allocation of
new cash flow to fixed-income securities. While management does not forecast realized investment
gains and losses, it believes that impairment charges in 2005 will be minimal. Every security in
the portfolio was trading at or above 75 percent of book value at December 31, 2004. Management
believes impairments should be limited to securities marked to market because they have been
identified for sale, or those where issuer-specific events cause sharp declines in market value
with little or no warning.

The company’s asset impairment committee continues to monitor the investment portfolio. The company
also is awaiting the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s final decision regarding EITF 03-1 (see
Item 8, Note 1, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, Page 79). Until that decision is announced, the
company is unable to estimate the impact of adoption of the standard on its recognition of
other-than-temporary impairment losses. The company’s current asset impairment policy is discussed
in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Asset Impairment, Page 27. The company believes that
the committee’s ongoing reviews help to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates that may
negatively change the value of the company’s holdings.

Other

Other income of the insurance subsidiaries, parent company operations and non-investment
operations of CFC Investment Company and CinFin Capital Management Company resulted in $8 million
in revenues in 2004 compared with $7 million in 2003 and $14 million in 2002. Losses before income
taxes of $37 million in 2004, $38 million and $32 million recorded in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, were primarily due to interest expense from debt of the parent company.

Taxes

Income tax expense was $216 million in 2004 compared with $106 million in 2003 and $41 million
in 2002. The effective tax rate for 2004 was 27.0 percent compared with 22.0 percent in 2003 and
14.8 percent in 2002. In addition to a rise in underwriting profits, the higher tax rate reflected
the higher level of capital gains, which are taxed at a 35 percent rate, compared with capital
losses in 2003.

The company pursues a strategy of investing some portion of cash flow in tax-advantaged fixed
maturities and equity securities to minimize its overall tax liability and maximize after-tax
earnings. See Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 84, for detail
regarding the company’s effective income tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow

OVERVIEW

Liquidity is a measure of the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the
short- and long-term cash requirements of business obligations.

The parent company’s cash requirements include general operating expenses, interest payments on its
long- and short-term debt, dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchases. The parent
company’s primary means of meeting its liquidity requirements are dividends and borrowings from its
insurance subsidiary and investment income from its investment portfolio. The company’s access to
the capital markets and short-term bank borrowing also provide other potential sources of
liquidity.

The property casualty and life insurance operations’ short-term cash needs primarily consist of
paying insurance loss and loss expenses as well as ongoing operating expenses and payments of
dividends to the parent company. Historically, those needs have been met through underwriting cash
flow and investment income. Although the company has never sold investments to pay claims, the sale
of investments would provide an additional source of liquidity, if required. After satisfying
short-term cash requirements, excess cash flows from underwriting are invested in fixed-income and
equity securities in the insurance subsidiaries, leading to the potential for increases in future
investment income and realized gains.

As described in Item 1, Regulations, Page 15, and Item 8, Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, Page 83, dividends paid to the parent company by its insurance subsidiary are
restricted by Ohio regulatory requirements. Further, management intends for all insurance
subsidiaries to maintain their superior financial strength ratings, which may constrain their
dividend-paying capacity. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the company’s insurance subsidiary declared
ordinary dividends of $175 million, $50 million and $100 million, respectively, to the parent
company. The subsidiary can pay up to $588 million in ordinary dividends to the parent company in
2005 without approval from the Ohio Department of Insurance.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Operating activities are conducted primarily by the property casualty and life insurance
companies. Underwriting generates positive cash flows because cash from premium payments generally
is received in advance of cash payments required to settle claims. The increase in the positive
cash flow from operating activities generated in each of the past three years resulted from the
improvement in the results of operations discussed above.

The following table summarizes cash flow of the insurance subsidiary (direct method):

Premiums collected have risen over the past three years because of growth in written premiums.
Paid losses and related loss expenses accounted for approximately 84 percent, 82 percent and 74
percent of property casualty and life insurance losses and policyholder benefits incurred in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Excess cash flows from underwriting, investment and other corporate activities are invested in
fixed-income and equity securities on an ongoing basis to help achieve the company’s portfolio
objectives. See Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 13, for a discussion of the company’s investment
strategy, portfolio allocation and quality.

Disposition of investments occurs for a number of reasons (See Item 8, Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows, Page 75):

•

Sales of fixed maturities investments. Although the company
prefers to hold fixed-income securities until maturity, a
decision to sell or to reduce a holding reflects management’s
perception of a change in the underlying fundamentals of the
security and preference to allocate those funds to investments
that more closely meet the established parameters for long-term
stability and growth. In 2004 and 2003, sales of fixed-income
securities rose as the company sold securities that it deemed to
have limited upside potential.

2004 10-K Page 51


•

Call or maturity of fixed maturity investments. Calls of U.S.
agency paper in 2004 and 2003 were the primary reason for the
increase in calls and maturities of fixed maturity investments.
The company has purchased U.S. agency paper with higher coupons
and shorter call protection features.

•

Sales of equity securities investments. Sales of equity
securities rose in 2004 due to the sale of $356 million in
equity holdings (see Investments Results of Operations, Page 47,
for a discussion of equity sales in 2004).

Purchases of investments reflected the company’s historical portfolio allocation strategy through the first quarter of 2004:

Assets

Overview

At December 31, 2004, the investment portfolio made up 78.5 percent of total assets compared
with 80.3 percent at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the remainder consisted primarily of
other invested assets (0.2 percent), premium receivables (6.9 percent), reinsurance receivables
(4.2 percent), deferred acquisition costs (2.5 percent) and separate accounts (3.0 percent). These
percentages have remained relatively constant over the last few years.

2004 10-K Page 52


Total assets increased 3.9 percent, or $598 million, to $16.107 billion at year-end 2004. The
increase primarily reflected:

Investment Portfolio

The market value of the company’s investment portfolio was $12.639 billion and $12.449 billion
at year-end 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Insurance regulatory and statutory requirements designed to protect policyholders from investment
risk influence the company’s investment decisions on an individual insurance company basis. Cash
generated from insurance operations is invested almost entirely in five classes of assets evaluated
for yield and risk prior to purchase (see Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 13, for a discussion of
the five classes of assets). In 2004, the company temporarily changed the allocation of new
property casualty portfolio investments to reduce the ratio of common stock to statutory surplus.
The property casualty portfolio maintained that ratio below 100 percent throughout the 1990s (see
Item 1, Financial Strength Ratings, Page 7, for additional information). The ratio of common stock
to statutory surplus for the property casualty insurance group portfolio was 103.5 percent at
year-end 2004 compared with 114.7 percent at year-end 2003.

On August 26, 2004, the company announced it transferred approximately 31.8 million shares of Fifth
Third common stock to The Cincinnati Insurance Company, Cincinnati Financial Corporation’s
insurance subsidiary, from the parent company. This action was related to the June 28, 2004,
application to the SEC seeking exemptive relief under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (see Item
1, Regulation, Page
15, for more detail regarding the holding company’s status under the Investment Company Act). The
transfer was authorized by Cincinnati Financial’s board of directors on August 13, 2004, and
approved by the Ohio Department of Insurance on August 24, 2004.

While the transfer raised The Cincinnati Insurance Company’s surplus, the action was not a means to
accelerate growth or strengthen loss reserves. Rather, it allowed the company to retain the
financial flexibility that continues to support its high financial strength ratings. At December
31, 2004, statutory surplus for the property casualty insurance group was $4.191 billion compared
with $2.783 billion at December 31, 2003.

Management anticipates continuing the temporary allocation of nearly 100 percent of cash flow
available for investment to fixed-income and convertible security purchases until mid-2005. Over
the longer term, the company anticipates continuing to invest in equity securities to help achieve
its portfolio objectives.

The company’s portfolio investments are primarily in publicly traded fixed-income and equity and
equity-linked securities, classified as available for sale in the accompanying financial
statements. Valuations of all of the company’s investments are based on either listed prices or
data provided by FT Interactive Data, an outside resource that supplies global securities pricing.
Changes in the fair value of these securities, based on the listed prices or information from FT
Interactive Data, are reported on the company’s balance sheet in other comprehensive income, net of
tax. Fixed maturities (fixed-income bonds and notes) and equity and equity-linked securities
(common and preferred stocks) are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value in
the financial statements.

At December 31, 2004, the company’s portfolio of fixed-income securities had a weighted average
yield-to-book of 5.8 percent, a weighted average maturity of 9.4 years and a weighted average
modified duration to maturity of 6.9 years. At December 31, 2003, the company’s portfolio of
fixed-income securities had a weighted average yield-to-book value of 6.6 percent, a weighted
average maturity of 9.5 years and a weighted average modified duration to maturity of 6.7 years.
The decline in the yield-to-book was due to lower prevailing interest rates as well as the
company’s’ focus on tax-exempt municipal bonds, which have a lower gross yield. The average
maturity of the fixed-income portfolio declined slightly because of the company’s focus on the
intermediate portion of the yield curve and the purchase of approximately $100 million in
short-term bonds to fund estimated construction payments for the headquarters expansion.

The average duration to maturity increased slightly as lower coupon levels offset shorter
maturities (see Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 13, for additional discussion of the fixed-income
portfolio). Modified duration can be defined as the average maturity of all bond payments, where
each payment is weighted by its value. In the fixed-income

2004 10-K Page 53


market, duration is used to measure the
sensitivity of an asset price to movements in yields. See Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Page 80, for additional information regarding the maturity of the company’s
fixed-income portfolio.

Over the past several years, the company has invested a higher portion of available funds in U.S.
agency paper and insured municipal bonds, resulting in a significant rise in the percentage of the
portfolio rated A and above based on fair value (market value). The majority of non-rated
securities are tax-exempt municipal bonds from smaller municipalities that chose not to pursue a
credit rating. Credit ratings as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, for the company’s fixed income
portfolio were:

Similar to the equity portfolio, the fixed-income portfolio is concentrated in the financials
sector, including banks, brokerage, finance and investment and insurance companies. Management
leverages its familiarity with this sector in its fixed-income portfolio. The financials sector
represented 15.7 percent and 16.1 percent, respectively, of book value and market value of the
overall fixed-income portfolio at December 31, 2004, compared with 16.7 percent and 17.1 percent of
book value and market value at December 31, 2003. Approximately 85.3 percent of the market value of
financials sector holdings were investment-grade corporate bonds at year-end 2004 compared with
82.2 percent at year-end 2003. No other industry accounts for more than 10 percent of the
fixed-income portfolio.

USAIG Pool Participation

At December 31, 2004, $260 million, or 38.2 percent, of total reinsurance receivables,
compared with $324 million, or 52.3 percent, at December 31, 2003, related to the company’s
participation in USAIG, a joint underwriting association of individual insurance companies that
collectively function as a worldwide insurance market for all types of aviation and aerospace
accounts. The reinsurance receivable primarily relates to September 11, 2001, events. The decline
in 2004 was due to a partial reduction in those loss reserves.

Due to the company’s participation in USAIG for policy years 2001 and prior, The Cincinnati
Insurance Company was named as the designated insurer for American Airlines’ policy year 2000
business. Reinsurance recoverables resulting from all American Airlines accidents during that year
were recorded on The Cincinnati Insurance Companies’ 2001 financial statements. Management expects
to recover 100 percent of the reinsurance recoverables associated with the USAIG participation
although it is impossible to estimate the timeframe for recovery due to the complex nature of
aviation and aerospace insurance. More than 99 percent of the reinsurance recoverables associated
with USAIG are backed by securities on deposit. The company no longer participates in new business
generated by USAIG and its members.

Liabilities

Overview

At December 31, 2004, insurance reserves were 48.1 percent of total liabilities compared with
47.7 percent at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the remainder of liabilities consisted
primarily of unearned premiums (15.6 percent), deferred income tax (18.6 percent) and long- and
short-term debt (8.0 percent).

2004 10-K Page 54


Total liabilities increased 5.9 percent, or $553 million, to $9.858 billion at December 31, 2004
from $9.305 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase primarily reflected:

•

$303 million increase in insurance reserves as discussed below. The company does not discount its property casualty
reserves.

•

$93 million increase in unearned premiums due to higher premium volume.

•

$371 million increase in long-term debt as discussed below.

Offsetting the increases were a $183 million decline in notes payable and a $115 million decline in
deferred income tax liability, primarily reflecting lower unrealized gains in the investment
portfolio.

Property Casualty Reserve Levels

At year-end 2004, the total reserve balance, net of reinsurance, was $2.977 billion, compared
with $2.845 billion at year-end 2003 and $2.608 billion at year-end 2002 (see Item 8, Note 4 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 82, for a reconciliation of property casualty reserve
balances with the loss and loss expense liability on the balance sheet). The reserves reflected in
the financial statements are management’s most accurate estimation.

The outside actuary’s range for adequate statutory reserves, net of reinsurance, was $2.794 billion
to $3.032 billion for 2004; $2.696 billion to $2.906 billion for 2003; and $2.492 billion to $2.674
billion for 2002. The assumptions used to establish the recommended ranges were consistent with the
actuary’s practices. Historically, the company has established reserves in the upper half of the
actuary’s range, as discussed in Critical Accounting Policies, Loss and Loss Expense Reserves, Page
25.

In addition to management’s conclusions regarding adequate reserve levels, other factors that have
affected reserve levels over the past three years included:

The types of coverages the company offers and the risk levels retained have a direct influence on
the development of claims. Specifically, claims that develop quickly and have lower risk retention
levels generally are more predictable.

As discussed in Commercial Lines Segment Reserves, Page 56, management’s decision to re-underwrite
the commercial lines book of business beginning in 2000, including non-renewing certain
policyholders due to risk levels, and increasing rates to better reflect exposure levels, has
already resulted in improved profitability. Management believes the program is leading to a lower
risk profile for the overall commercial lines segment, which should contribute to favorable loss
reserve trends.

As discussed in Personal Lines Segment Reserves, Page 58, management is seeking to improve its
personal lines segment performance, in particular the homeowner business line, partially by
reducing risk exposure through changes in policy terms and conditions. Management does not expect
its actions in personal lines to have a material impact on loss reserve trends, largely due to the
relatively short-tail nature of homeowner claims.

In 2003 and 2004, $70 million in reserves were released following the November 2003 Ohio Supreme
Court’s limiting of its 1999

Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mutual

decision. The reserve releases were
primarily made in the commercial auto and other liability business lines. As background, the Ohio
Supreme Court’s 1999 decision in Scott-Pontzer greatly increased the exposure on commercial auto
insurance
policies. That ruling extended Ohio businesses’ uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist coverage
in force over the preceding 15 years to their employees when they were not working and to the
employees’ resident family members. It contributed to changes in policy wording for UM/UIM
coverage. Additionally, the same court’s 2000 decision in

Linko v. Indemnity

effectively caused
insurers to extend UM/UIM coverage, at the newly increased level of exposure, to every auto
insurance policy in Ohio at no additional premium. The two court rulings affected all auto insurers
in the state. Between 1999 and December 2003, the company had established case and IBNR reserves
for past UM/UIM losses on the basis of the 1999 and 2000 decisions. In the November 2003 decision
to limit the Scott-Pontzer decision, the court ruled that an employer’s commercial automobile
insurance policy only covers injured employees and only when the accident happens in the course and
scope of their employment.

Following the fourth-quarter 2003 reserve review, reserve levels were modified to reflect
management’s assessment that mold claims behaved similar to asbestos and environmental claims, and
reserves for these claims should be estimated using similar methods. These changes have been seen
predominately in the commercial multi-peril business line. Management expects that mold exclusions
added to the company’s commercial policies beginning in 2003 will mitigate this issue after 2006.

2004 10-K Page 55


Further, beginning in 2003, reserve levels reflected the need to establish higher expense reserves
because of the rise in litigation costs due to larger and more complex claims. These changes have
been seen predominately in commercial multi-peril and other liability business lines.

Beginning in 2002, management’s conclusions regarding reserve levels for all business lines
reflected refinement of the manner in which the value of future salvage and subrogation for claims
already incurred were estimated.

Also in 2002, management increased IBNR reserves because of higher than expected paid and/or
reported development in workers compensation, commercial multi-peril and other liability business
lines for accident years 1999 through 2001.

Asbestos and Environmental Reserves

Management believes that the company’s asbestos and environment reserves, including mold
reserves, are adequate at this time and that these coverage areas are immaterial to the company’s
financial position due to the types of accounts the company has insured in the past.

Loss and loss expenses incurred for all asbestos and environmental claims were $41 million, or 2.4
percent of total loss and loss expenses in 2004, compared with $28 million, or 1.6 percent, in
2003, and $37 million, or 2.2 percent, in 2002. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to mold
claims.

Net reserves for all asbestos and environmental claims were increased to $135 million in 2004
compared with $105 million in 2003 and $88 million in 2002. Net reserves for all asbestos and
environmental claims were 4.5 percent, 3.7 percent and 3.4 percent of total reserves, in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

Commercial accounts generally were written by the company after the development of coverage forms
that exclude asbestos cleanup costs. The company believes its exposure to risks associated with
past production and/or installation of asbestos materials is minimal because the company was
primarily a personal lines company when most of the asbestos exposure occurred. The commercial
coverage the company did offer was predominantly related to local-market construction activity
rather than asbestos manufacturing. Further, over the past three years, to limit its exposure to
mold and other environmental risks going forward, the company has revised policy terms where
permitted by state regulation.

As a result of underwriting actions taken since 2000 and a generally favorable insurance
marketplace, the commercial lines segment has been able to obtain higher premium per exposure. As a
result, profitability has improved due to higher revenue on stable loss and loss expenses.

The overall favorable development recorded in the commercial lines reserves illustrates the
potential for revisions inherent in estimating reserves, especially in long-tail lines such as
other liability. With the exception of the UM/UIM reserve releases and other significant changes in
assumptions discussed above, commercial lines reserve development over the past three years was
consistent with:

•

The initiative, begun in 2001, to establish higher initial case reserves on liability claims in the period in which the
claim is reported.

•

Higher than expected medical inflation affecting the workers compensation line

•

Settlements that differed from the established case reserves

•

Changes in case reserves based on new information for specific claims or classes of claims

the potential for revisions inherent in estimating reserves. Personal lines reserve development
over the past three years was consistent with:

Life Insurance Segment Reserves

The company regularly reviews its life insurance business to ensure that any deferred
acquisition cost associated with the business is recoverable and that its actuarial liabilities
(life insurance segment reserves) make sufficient provision for future benefits and related
expenses. In 2004, deferred acquisition costs were written-off and reserves were

2004 10-K Page 59


restated for
certain second-to-die policies following a period of losses in this line. In calculating the
revised liabilities, the assumed investment yield was reduced to reflect current economic
conditions and the termination rate was adjusted in line with actual experience and reinsurance
ceded was calculated directly for each life insurance product, rather than averaging reinsurance
costs over several product areas.

Long- and Short-term Debt

At December 31, 2004, long-term debt was $791 million compared with $420 million at December
31, 2003.

The company issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due
2034 on November 1, 2004. The $368 million net proceeds from the offering:

•

Paid off $183 million in short-term debt. A portion of the
short-term debt was paid prior to the senior note offering using
funds borrowed from the property casualty subsidiary. Proceeds
from the offering were used to pay-off that inter-company loan in
addition to paying off the outstanding balance on the lines of
credit.

•

Will finance the construction of an estimated $100 million office
building and parking garage to be situated at the headquarters
located in Fairfield beginning in 2005, as announced in August
2004.

•

Are available for general corporate purposes.

The company currently is working to commence an exchange offer with respect to the 6.125% senior
notes issued in 2004 under the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the
offering of these notes. Management believes it will meet the timetable for completion of the
exchange offer specified in the registration rights agreement. The interest rate of the notes will
increase if the company does not comply with certain obligations under the registration rights
agreement.

In addition, the company has $420 million aggregate principal amount of 6.9% senior debentures due
2028. Neither note is encumbered by rating triggers. The company has minimized its reliance on debt
financing although it utilizes lines of credit to fund short-term cash needs.

As of March 4, 2005, the company’s senior debt was rated aa- by A.M. Best Co., A+ by Fitch Ratings,
A2 by Moody’s Investors Services and A by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services. During 2004, A.M. Best
and Standard & Poor’s changed their credit ratings for the senior debt due to their firms’
respective notching strategies. Notching is a rating organization standard that places an insurer’s
credit rating generally two or three levels below its insurer financial strength rating (see Item
1, Financial Strength Ratings, Page 7, for discussion of the company’s insurer financial strength
ratings). Notching recognizes that in the event of financial problems, obligations to policyholders
would be paid before obligations to creditors. A.M. Best and Standard & Poor’s moved the senior
debt credit ratings closer to their standard notching, although Standard & Poor’s commented that
CFC’s rating still was one level higher than is typical because of “the large pool of marketable
securities at the holding company.”

During 2004, the company paid-off $183 million of short-term debt. At year-end 2004, the company had one line of credit totaling
$75 million with no outstanding balance. There are no financial
covenants on the line of credit.

During 2004, the company terminated an interest-rate swap entered into by CFC Investment Company in
2001 as a cash hedge of variable interest payments for certain variable-rate debt obligations ($31
million notional amount) to better match fixed rate lease assets with liabilities having a fixed
financing rate. Under this interest-rate swap contract, the company agreed to pay a fixed rate of
interest for a seven-year period. The contract was considered to be a hedge against changes in the
amount of future cash flows associated with the related interest payments. When the company
paid-off the underlying debt, it terminated this agreement at a cost of $2 million, net of tax.

Interest expense on the company’s short- and long-term debt was $38 million (pretax), or 14 cents
per share (after tax), in 2004, which excludes interest expense on inter-company debt. Assuming the
company had issued the 6.125% senior notes on January 1, 2004, and used the proceeds as indicated,
management estimates interest expense would have been $52 million (pretax), or 20 cents per share
(after tax), in 2004.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

The company had no off-balance sheet arrangements (defined for purposes of applicable SEC
rules) at year-end 2004.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook

Management anticipates investing approximately $15 million in key technology initiatives in
2005, primarily for its claims management and commercial lines policy processing systems (see Item
1, Property Casualty Insurance Operations, Page 1, for discussion of the technology initiatives
underway). Capitalized development costs related to key technology initiatives totaled $14 million
in 2004. These activities are conducted at management’s discretion and no material contractual
obligations exist for activities planned as part of these projects. In addition, material
commitments for computer hardware and software, including maintenance contracts on hardware and
other known obligations, are expected to require approximately $13 million over the next five
years.

The construction of an office building and parking garage to be situated at the headquarters
located in Fairfield is expected to require approximately $100 million over a four-year period. On
January 6, 2005, the company entered into a cost-plus contract with Messer Construction Co. for
design-build services in connection with the project. The company

2004 10-K Page 60


currently is working with Messer on design modifications that will be used to determine the final project cost. Construction
preparation began in the first quarter of 2005 with completion estimated by September 2008.

At December 31, 2004, the company estimated its future contractual obligations as follows:

Estimated material commitments for net property casualty loss and loss expense reserves represented
approximately 55 percent of the estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004. The
company directs its staff to settle claims and pay losses as quickly as practical and made $1.621
billion in net claim payments during 2004. As of December 31, 2004, the company had net property
casualty reserves of $2.977 billion, reflecting $1.522 billion in unpaid amounts on reported claims
(case reserves), $634 million in loss expense reserves and $821 million in estimates of IBNR
claims. The specific amounts and timing of obligations related to case reserves and related loss
expenses are not set contractually. The amounts and timing of obligations for IBNR claims and
related loss expenses are unknown.

Nonetheless, based on cumulative property casualty claims paid over the last ten years, the company
anticipates that approximately 34 percent of property casualty reserves will be paid within one
year, an additional 36 percent between one and three years, 14 percent between three and five
years, and 16 percent in more than five years. While management believes that historical
performance of loss payment patterns is a reasonable source for projecting future claims payments,
there is inherent uncertainty in this estimate of contractual obligations.

The historic pattern of using premium receipts for the payment of loss and loss expenses has
enabled the company to extend slightly the maturities of the investment portfolio beyond the
estimated settlement date of the loss reserves. The effective duration to maturity of the company’s
fixed-income portfolio was 6.9 years at December 31, 2004. By contrast, at December 31, 2004, the
duration of the company’s loss and loss expense reserves was 3.0 years and the duration of all
liabilities was 2.7 years. Management believes this difference in duration does not affect the
company’s ability to meet its current obligations because cash flow from operations is sufficient
to meet these obligations. In addition, the company’s investment strategy has led to substantial
unrealized gains from holdings in equity securities. These equity holdings could be liquidated to
meet higher than anticipated loss and loss expenses.

Management believes that the insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and
operating expenses, as well as meet commitments in the event of unforeseen circumstances such as
catastrophe losses, reinsurer insolvencies, changes in the timing of claims payments, increases in
claims severity, reserve deficiencies or inadequate premium rates. Management believes catastrophic
events are the most likely cause of an unexpected rise in claims severity or frequency.

Management believes the effect on future liquidity of these items may be offset by:

•

Reinsurance – The company’s property catastrophe reinsurance program
mitigates the liquidity risk of an unexpected rise in claims severity
or frequency due to a catastrophic event. The company’s current
catastrophe reinsurance treaties provide coverage for gross losses up
to $500 million (see Item 1, Reinsurance, Page 6, for a summary of the
company’s reinsurance agreements). Under the terms of the catastrophe
reinsurance treaties, the company retains the first $25 million in
losses, 40 percent of the next $20 million in losses and 5 percent of
losses from $45 million to $500 million, resulting in a maximum cash
outlay of $56 million for gross losses up to $500 million. The
company’s reinsurance treaties are with highly rated firms with which
the company has done business for a number of years. Reinsurance does
not relieve the company of its obligation to pay covered claims. The
financial strength of the company’s reinsurers is important because
the company’s ability to
recover for losses under one of the reinsurance agreements depends on the financial viability of the reinsurer.

•

Financial strength — As discussed above, the company anticipates that
approximately 34 percent of property casualty insurance reserves will
be paid within one year, an additional 36 percent between one and
three years, 14 percent between three and five years, and 16 percent
in more than five years. These timings are based on cumulative
property casualty claims paid over the last 10 years. While management
believes that historical

2004 10-K Page 61


performance of loss payment patterns is a
reasonable source for projecting future claims payments, there is
inherent uncertainty in this estimate of contractual obligations.
Management believes that it could meet its obligations under a
significant and unexpected change in the timing of these payments
because of the liquidity of the company’s invested assets, strong
financial position and access to lines of credit.

•

Financial resources – On August 26, 2004, the company announced that
Cincinnati Financial Corporation transferred approximately 31.8
million shares of Fifth Third common stock to The Cincinnati Insurance
Company, the property casualty insurance subsidiary. This action was
related to the company’s June 28, 2004, application to the SEC seeking
exemptive relief under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The
transfer was authorized by Cincinnati Financial’s board of directors
on August 13, 2004, and approved by the Ohio Department of Insurance
on August 24, 2004.

The asset transfer resolved the holding company’s current status under the Investment Company
Act. See Item 1, Regulation, Page 15, for discussion of the risks associated with the
application for exemptive relief.

If it were to be determined that the company was an unregistered investment company before the
asset transfer, Cincinnati Financial could be unable to enforce contracts undertaken with third
parties during the period that it was an unregistered investment company. Third parties could
seek to rescind transactions undertaken with Cincinnati Financial during that period. As a
result, it could be determined that holders of Cincinnati Financial’s $420 million aggregate
principal amount of 6.9% Senior Debentures due 2028 have a right to rescind such indebtedness,
thereby requiring Cincinnati Financial to immediately repay such amounts. However, equitable
considerations set forth in the Investment Company Act could support the company’s right to
enforce contracts and could limit or prevent third-parties’ ability to rescind a transaction.
However, Cincinnati Financial currently has available sufficient assets or could access the
capital markets to fund such repayment and believes that its assets are adequate to meet its
short- and long-term obligations. In the event the company chose to access the capital markets,
current market conditions would dictate the rate on new debt, which could be higher than the 6.9
percent currently paid on the debt.

Shareholders’ Equity

Overview

Total shareholders’ equity was 38.8 percent and 40.0 percent of total assets at year-end 2004
and 2003, respectively.

As a long-term investor, the company has followed a buy-and-hold strategy for more than 40 years. A
significant amount of unrealized appreciation on equity investments has been generated as a result
of this policy. Unrealized appreciation on equity investments, before deferred income taxes, was
$5.553 billion and $6.001 billion at year-end 2004 and 2003, respectively. On an after-tax basis,
it constituted 57.8 percent of total shareholders’ equity at year-end 2004.

Unrealized gains in the investment portfolio (accumulated other comprehensive income) from
long-term appreciation and investment of cash flows have resulted in year-end 2004 shareholders’
equity of $6.249 billion. Investments at the parent company give management flexibility to support
its capitalization policies for the subsidiaries, improve the ability of the insurance companies to
write additional premiums and maintain high ratings.

During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the company had realized investment

losses of $56 million, $122 million and $152 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004,
unrealized investment gains before taxes totaled $5.857 billion and unrealized investment losses in
the investment portfolio amounted to $17 million. The unrealized appreciation was primarily due to
the company’s holdings in Fifth Third (Nasdaq:FITB) and Alltel Corporation (NYSE:AT) common stock.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Introduction

Market risk is the potential for a decrease in securities value resulting from broad yet
uncontrollable forces such as: inflation, economic growth, interest rates, world political
conditions or other widespread unpredictable events. It is comprised of many individual risks that,
when combined, create a macroeconomic impact. The company accepts and manages risks in the
investment portfolio as part of the means of achieving portfolio objectives. Some of the risks are:

Company-specific risk is the potential for a particular issuer to experience a decline in valuation
due to the impact of sector or market risk on the holding or because of issues specific to the
firm:

•

Fraud – the potential for a negative impact on an issuer’s
performance due to actual or alleged illegal or improper activity
of individuals it employs

•

Credit – the potential for deterioration in an issuer’s financial
profile due to specific company issues, problems it faces in the
course of its operations or industry-related issues

•

Default – the possibility that an issuer will not make a required
payment (interest payment or return of principal) on its debt.
Generally this occurs after its financial profile has deteriorated
(credit risk) and it no longer has the means to make its payments

The investment committee of the board of directors monitors the investment risk management process
primarily through its executive oversight of investment activities. The company takes an active
approach to managing market and other investment risks, including the accountabilities and controls
over these activities. Actively managing these market risks is integral to the company’s operations
and could require a change in the character of future investments purchased or sold or require a
shift in the existing asset portfolios to manage exposure to market risk within acceptable ranges.
The approach is applied daily by the company’s portfolio managers and analysts to each of the five
asset classes in which the company invests.

Sector risk is the potential for a negative impact on a particular industry due to its sensitivity
to factors that make up market risk. Market risk affects general supply/demand factors for an
industry and will affect companies within that industry to varying degrees.

Risks associated with the five asset classes described in Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 13, can
be summarized as follows

For investment-grade corporate bonds, the inverse relationship between interest rates and bond
prices leads to falling bond values during periods of increasing interest rates. Although the
potential for a worsening financial condition, and ultimately default, does exist with
investment-grade corporate bonds, their higher-quality financial profiles make credit risk less of
a concern than for lower-quality investments. The company addresses this risk by consistently
investing

2004 10-K Page 63


within a particular maturity range, which has, over the years, provided the portfolio
with a laddered maturity schedule, which management believes is less subject to large swings in
value due to interest rate changes. While a single maturity range may see values drop due to
general interest rate levels, other maturity ranges will be less affected by those changes.
Additionally, purchases are spread across a wide spectrum of industries and companies, diversifying
the company’s holdings and minimizing the impact of specific industries or companies with greater
sensitivities to interest rate fluctuations.

The primary risk related to high-yield corporate bonds is credit risk or the potential for a
deteriorating financial structure. A weak financial profile can lead to rating downgrades from the
credit rating agencies, which can put further downward pressure on bond prices. Interest rate risk
is less of a factor with high-yield corporate bonds, as valuation is related more directly to
underlying operating performance than to general interest rates. This puts more emphasis on the
financial results achieved by the issuer rather than general economic trends or statistics within
the marketplace. The company addresses this concern by analyzing issuer- and industry-specific
financial results and by closely monitoring holdings within this asset class.

The primary risks related to tax-exempt bonds are interest rate risk and geo-political risk
associated with the specific economic environment within the political boundaries of the issuing
municipal entity. The company addresses these concerns by focusing on municipalities’
general-obligation debt and on essential-service bonds. Essential-service bonds derive a revenue
stream from the services provided by the municipality, which are vital to the people living in the
area (schools, water service, sewer service, etc.). Another risk related to tax-exempt bonds is
regulatory risk or the potential for legislative changes that would negate the benefit of owning
tax-exempt bonds. The company monitors regulatory activity for situations that may negatively
affect current holdings and its ongoing strategy for investing in these securities.

The final, less significant risk is a small exposure to credit risk for a portion of the tax-exempt
portfolio that has support from corporate entities. Examples are bonds insured by corporate bond
insurers or bonds with interest payments made by a corporate entity through a municipal
conduit/authority. While decisions regarding these investments primarily consider the underlying
municipal situation, the existence of third-party insurance reduces risk in the event of default.
In circumstances in which the municipality is unable to meet its obligations, risk would be
increased if the insuring entity were experiencing financial duress. Because of the company’s
diverse exposure and selection of higher-rated entities with strong financial profiles, the company
does not believe this is a material concern.

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis

Because of the company’s strong surplus, long-term investment horizon and its ability to hold
most fixed-income investments until maturity, management believes the company is well positioned if
interest rates were to rise. A higher rate environment would provide the opportunity to invest cash
flow in higher-yielding securities, while reducing the likelihood of calls of the higher-yielding
U.S. agency paper purchased over the past year. While higher interest rates would be expected to
continue to increase the number of fixed-income holdings trading below 100 percent of book value,
management believes lower fixed-income security values due solely to interest rate changes would
not signal a decline in credit quality.

The company is using a dynamic financial planning model developed during 2002 to further
incorporate analytical tools in assessing market risks. Management believes the model is improving
the company’s ability to measure the impact on bond values resulting from changes in interest
rates. Improved measurement of the impact of interest rate changes should allow for improved
matching of the company’s assets and liabilities.

The company measures modified duration to both the call date and maturity. The table below
summarizes modified duration and shows the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates on the
market value of the fixed-income portfolio under both modified duration scenarios:

The duration to maturity of the company’s bond portfolio is currently 6.9 years and the duration to
maturity of the redeemable preferred portfolio is currently 8.9 years. A 100 basis-point movement
in interest rates would result in an approximately 7.3 percent change in the market value of the
combined portfolios. Generally speaking, the higher a bond’s rating, the more directly correlated
movements in its market value will be to changes in the general level of interest rates. Therefore,
the municipal bond portfolio is more likely to respond to a changing interest rate scenario. The
company’s U.S. agency paper portfolio, because it generally has very little call protection, has a
low duration and would not be expected to be as responsive to rate movements. Lower investment
grade and high-yield corporate bond values are driven by credit spreads, as well as their
durations, in response to interest rate movements.

2004 10-K Page 64


In the dynamic financial planning model, the selected interest rate change of 100 basis points
represents management’s views of a shift in rates that is quite possible over a one-year period.
The rates modeled should not be considered a prediction of future events as interest rates may be
much more volatile in the future. The analysis is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the
effect of changes in rates on the company’s results or financial condition, nor does it take into
account any actions that might be taken to reduce exposure to such risks.

Equity and Equity-linked Securities

Common stocks are subject to a variety of risk factors encompassed under the umbrella of
market risk. General economic swings influence the performance of the underlying industries and
companies within those industries. A downturn in the economy will have a negative impact on an
equity portfolio. Industry- and company-specific risks have the potential to substantially affect
the market value of the company’s equity portfolio. The company addresses these risks by
maintaining investments in a small group of holdings that management can analyze closely, better
understanding their business and the related risk factors.

At December 31, 2004, the company held 14 individual equity positions valued at approximately $100
million or above, see Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 13, for additional details on these
holdings. These equity positions accounted for approximately 91.5 percent of the unrealized appreciation of
the entire portfolio.

Management believes the company’s equity investment style – centered on companies that pay and
increase dividends to shareholders – is an appropriate long-term strategy. While the company’s
long-term financial position would be affected by prolonged changes in the market valuation of its
investments, management believes the company’s strong surplus position and cash flow provide it
with a cushion against short-term fluctuations in valuation. The company believes that the
continued payment of cash dividends by the issuers of the common equities held by the company also
should provide a floor to their valuation.

The company’s investments are heavily weighted toward the financials sector, which represented 65.9
percent of the total market value of the common stock portfolio at December 31, 2004. Financials
sector investments typically underperform the overall market during periods when interest rates are
expected to rise. Management historically has seen these types of short-term fluctuations in market
value of its holdings as potential buying opportunities but is cognizant that a prolonged downturn
in this sector could create a long-term negative effect on the portfolio.

While past performance cannot guarantee future returns, over the longer term, the performance of
the company’s equity portfolio has exceeded that of the broader market, achieving a compound annual
total return of 3.2 percent for the five years ended December 31, 2004, compared with a compound
annual decline of 2.3 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, a common benchmark of market
performance. In 2004, the equity portfolio underperformed the market, with a total return of a
negative 1.9 percent, compared with the Standard & Poor’s 500’s return of 10.9 percent, primarily
because of market value fluctuations in its common stock holdings of Fifth Third.

The primary risk related to convertible securities is similar to other corporate fixed-income
securities in terms of their sensitivity to interest rates, credit risk and default risk. The
better the financial condition of the underlying issuer, the lower the credit risk. However, the
pricing of convertible securities is more likely to be driven by the relationship of the underlying
common stock price to the strike price of the embedded option. If the underlying stock price is
well below the strike price, the convertible security will trade more like a pure fixed-income
instrument and be more interest rate sensitive. However, as the underlying stock approaches the
option strike price, the convertible will be less interest rate sensitive and more responsive to
movements in the stock.

Fifth Third Bancorp Holding

The company held 72.8 million shares of Fifth Third common stock at a cost of $283 million at
December 31, 2004. The market value of the company’s Fifth Third position was $3.443 billion at
year-end 2004, or 46.1 percent of the company’s total common equity portfolio, compared with $4.301
billion, or 52.7 percent, at year-end 2003. The after-tax unrealized gain represented by the
company’s Fifth Third position was $2.054 billion, or 54.1 percent of the company’s total after-tax
unrealized gains at year-end 2004, compared with $2.612 billion, or 63.8 percent, at year-end 2003.
The Fifth Third position represented $12.28 of the company’s total book value of $37.38 per share
at year-end 2004, compared with $15.51 at year-end 2003

.

Every $1.00 change in the market
price of Fifth Third’s common stock has approximately a 28 cent impact on book value per share. A
20 percent ($9.46) change in the market price of Fifth Third’s common stock, which was $47.30 at
December 31, 2004, would result in a $689 million change in assets and a $448 million change in
after-tax unrealized gains. This would affect shareholders’ equity by 7.2 percent and book value by
$2.68 per share.

Fifth Third’s value over the past two years was affected by uncertainty surrounding a regulatory
review that was concluded in early 2004. Fifth Third continues to meet Cincinnati Financial’s
investing criteria. Cincinnati Financial management and the investment committee of the board of
directors review the Fifth Third holding on a continual basis.

2004 10-K Page 65


Unrealized Investment gains and Losses

At December 31, 2004, unrealized investment gains before taxes totaled $5.857 billion and
unrealized investment losses in the investment portfolio amounted to $17 million.

Unrealized Investment Gains

The unrealized gains at year-end 2004 were primarily due to long-term gains from the company’s
holdings in the common stock of Fifth Third (Nasdaq: FITB) and Alltel Corporation (NYSE:AT).
Reflecting the company’s long-term investment philosophy, of the 1,385 securities trading at or
above book value, 761, or 54.9 percent, have shown unrealized gains for more than 24 months.

Unrealized Investment Losses – Potential Other-than-temporary Impairments

The asset impairment policy evaluates significant decreases in the market value of the assets;
changes in legal factors or in the business climate; or other such factors indicating whether or
not the carrying amount may be recoverable. A declining trend in market value, the extent of the
market value decline and the length of time in which the value has been depressed are objective
measures that can be outweighed by subjective measures such as impending events and issuer
liquidity. Impairment is evaluated in the event of a declining market value for four consecutive
quarters with quarter-end market value below 50 percent of book value or a market value 50 percent
below book value for three consecutive quarters. In addition to applying the impairment policy, the
status of the portfolio is constantly monitored by the company’s portfolio managers for indications
of potential problems or issues that may be possible impairment issues. If an impairment indicator
is noted, the portfolio managers even more closely scrutinize the security.

The number of securities trading below 100 percent of book value at December 31, 2004, was above
the number at December 31, 2003. The number of securities trading below 100 percent of book value
can be expected to fluctuate as interest rates rise or fall. In addition, the portfolio benefited
from continued improvements in the credit quality of the bond portfolio, as rated by Standard &
Poor’s and Moody’s. Further, book values for some securities have been revised due to impairment
charges recognized during 2003 and 2002. During 2004, four securities were written down as
other-than-temporarily impaired.

A total of 208 holdings were trading below book value at December 31, 2004, representing 7.0
percent of invested assets and $17 million in unrealized losses. Management deems the risk related
to securities trading between 70 percent and 100 percent of book value to be relatively minor and
at least partially offset by the earned income potential of these investments.

•

Two hundred of these holdings were trading between 90 percent and
100 percent of book value at December 31, 2004. The value of these
securities fluctuates primarily because of changes in interest
rates. The market value of these 200 securities was $856 million
at December 31, 2004, and they accounted for $11 million in
unrealized losses.

•

Eight of these holdings were trading below 90 percent of book
value at December 31, 2004. The market value of these holdings was
$27 million at December 31, 2004, and they accounted for the
remaining $6 million in unrealized losses. These holdings are
being monitored for credit- and industry-related risk factors. Of
these securities, three are airline-related.

Holdings trading below 70 percent of book value are monitored for potential other-than-temporary
impairment. At December 31, 2004, no holdings were trading below 70 percent of book value. At
year-end 2003, two securities with a combined book value of $70 thousand were trading below 70
percent of book value.

As discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Asset Impairment, Page 27, when
evaluating other-than-temporary impairments, management considers the company’s ability to retain a
security for a period adequate to recover a substantial portion of its cost. Because of the
company’s investment philosophy and strong capitalization, it can hold securities until their
scheduled redemption that might otherwise be deemed impaired as management evaluates their
potential for recovery based economic, industry or company factors.

While management does not forecast realized investment gains and losses, it believes that
impairment charges in 2005 will be minimal. Every security in the portfolio was trading at or above
75 percent of book value at December 31, 2004. Management believes impairments should be limited to
securities marked to market because they have been identified for sale, or those where
issuer-specific events cause sharp declines in market value with little or no warning.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Responsibility for Financial Statements

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and
subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2004, were prepared by management in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).

The management of the company is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial
statements, which are presented on an accrual basis of accounting and include amounts based upon
management’s best estimates and judgment. Other financial information in the Annual Report on Form
10-K is consistent in all material respects with that in the financial statements. The accounting
system and related internal controls are designed to assure that the books and records reflect the
transactions of the company in accordance with established policies and procedures as implemented
by qualified personnel.

The board of directors has established an audit committee composed of independent outside directors
who are believed to be free from any relationship that could interfere with the exercise of
independent judgment as audit committee members.

The audit committee meets periodically with management, the independent registered public
accounting firms and the internal auditors to make inquiries as to the manner in which the
responsibilities of each are being discharged and reports thereon to the board of directors. In
addition, the audit committee recommends to the board of directors the annual appointment of the
independent registered public accounting firms with whom the audit committee reviews the scope of
the audit assignment, adequacy of internal controls and internal audit procedures.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the
consolidated financial statements of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and subsidiaries for the year
ended December 31, 2004, and their report is included herein. The auditors meet with members of the
audit committee of the board of directors to discuss the results of their examination and are
afforded the opportunity to present their opinions in the absence of management personnel with
respect to the adequacy of internal controls and the quality of financial reporting of the company.

2004 10-K Page 69


Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls, designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (GAAP). The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that:

1.

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

2.

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the
directors of the company; and

3.

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the
possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even
effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the
effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act
of 2002. Management’s assessment is based on the criteria established in the Internal Control –
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and was designed to provide reasonable assurance that the company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. The assessment led management to conclude
that, as of December 31, 2004, the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective
based on those criteria.

The company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, and the company’s management
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Cincinnati Financial Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cincinnati Financial Corporation
and subsidiaries (the company) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed
in the Index at Item 15(a)2. We also have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting report, that
the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on the criteria established in the

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The company’s management is
responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedules, an opinion on management’s assessment, and
an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment that the
company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Furthermore, in our opinion, the company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Cincinnati Financial Corporation (company) underwrites insurance through four insurance
companies that market through a network of local independent insurance agents. Insurance products
include a broad range of business and personal policies, as well as life and disability income
insurance and annuities. In addition, the company provides finance/leasing and asset management
services through its CFC Investment Company and CinFin Capital Management Company subsidiaries.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and subsidiaries,
each of which is wholly owned, and are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Property Casualty Insurance

Expenses incurred in the issuance of policies are deferred and amortized over the terms of the
policies. These expenses vary with and primarily relate to acquiring insurance business,
principally agents’ commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting costs. Anticipated
investment income is not considered in determining if a premium deficiency related to insurance
contracts exists. Policy premiums are deferred and earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the
policies. The portion of written premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is
recorded as unearned premiums. Loss and loss expense reserves are based on claims reported prior to
the end of the year and estimates of unreported claims net of estimates for salvage and subrogation
reserves, based upon facts for each claim and the company’s experience with similar claims. The
establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently
uncertain process. Reserve estimates are regularly reviewed and updated, using the most current
information available. Any resulting adjustments are reflected in current operations.

The Cincinnati Insurance Companies market property casualty insurance policies in 31 states. Nine
states with at least $100 million in agency earned premium in 2004 generated approximately 69
percent and 70 percent of total property casualty premiums in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Ohio,
where the company has 187 independent agencies, accounted for 23.7 percent and 24.6 percent of
total earned premiums in 2004 and 2003. Agencies in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin each contributed between 4 percent and 10 percent of
premium volume in 2004 and 2003. No single agency accounted for more than 1.1 percent of the
company’s total agency direct earned premiums.

Life Insurance

Traditional products require the policyholder to pay scheduled premiums over the life of the
coverage. The company recognizes premiums received on traditional products as revenue when due.

Limited-pay products require the policyholder to pay scheduled premiums up front on coverage that
is provided for an extended period. Limited-pay products include single-premium deferred annuities
or life insurance policies with a limited premium-paying period. The company defers the amount of
premium in excess of the amount necessary to provide for all benefits and expenses and recognizes
it over the life of the coverage, using the gross profit method. Universal life products include those that allow policyholders to vary premiums at their discretion
or provide benefits or permit charges that are not fixed according to the terms of the policy.
Premiums for universal life products are not recognized as revenue when received. The company
recognizes cost of insurance charges, administration charges and surrender charges as revenue when
earned using the gross profit method.

Reserves for traditional products are based on expected expenses, mortality, withdrawal rates and
investment yields, including provision for adverse deviation. Once these assumptions are
established, they generally are maintained throughout the lives of the contracts. Expected
mortality is derived primarily from industry experience and withdrawal rates are based on company and industry
experience, while investment yield is based on company experience and the economic conditions then
in effect.

Reserves for universal life products are equal to the cumulative account balances, which include
premium deposits plus credited interest, less charges such as mortality and administration, and
withdrawals. Interest rates on approximately $612 million and $530 million of such reserves at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are periodically adjusted subject to economic conditions
then in effect and subject to contractually guaranteed minimum rates.

Expenses incurred in the issuance of traditional life insurance products, which include whole life
and term life insurance contracts, are deferred and amortized as premiums are earned. Expenses
incurred in the issuance of interest-sensitive products are deferred and amortized using the gross
profit method, adjusted for emerging experience and expected trends.

2004 10-K Page 76


Accident Health Insurance

Expenses incurred in the issuance of policies are deferred and amortized in level proportion
to earned premiums over the contract term. Policy premium income, unearned premiums and reserves
for unpaid losses are accounted for in substantially the same manner as property casualty insurance
items discussed above.

Lease/Finance

CFC Investment Company provides auto and equipment direct financing (leases and loans) to
commercial and individual clients. Generally, lease contracts transfer ownership of the property to
the lessees at the end of the lease terms and contain bargain purchase options. Income is
recognized over the financing term using the interest method.


Identified initial direct costs associated with the origination of a lease or loan are capitalized
and amortized, using the interest method, over the life of the financing. These costs include, but
are not limited to: finder fees, broker fees, filing fees and the cost of credit reports.

Asset Management

Billings are based on a fee structure calculated upon the market values of the assets at the
end of the period. Revenues are recognized as fees are earned. As of December 31, 2004, CinFin
Capital had 60 institutional, corporate and individual clients and $827 million under management,
compared with 53 clients and $762 million at December 31, 2003.

Reinsurance

In the normal course of business, the company seeks to reduce losses that may arise from
catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain
levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance companies and reinsurers.
Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the company from any obligation to policyholders. Although the
company historically has not experienced uncollectible reinsurance recoverables, failure of
reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the company. Amounts recoverable
from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the
reinsured policy.

The company also assumes some reinsurance from other insurance companies, reinsurers and
involuntary state pools. Such assumed reinsurance activity is recorded principally on the basis of
reports received from the ceding companies.

Investments

Fixed maturities (bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks) and equity securities (common
and non-redeemable preferred stocks) are classified as available for sale and are stated at fair
values.

Unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes, are included in shareholders’ equity in
accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on investments are recognized in
net income on a specific identification basis.

Investment income consists primarily of interest and dividends. Interest is recognized on an
accrual basis and dividends are recorded at the ex-dividend date. The interest method is used for
amortizing premiums and discounts on fixed-maturity securities.

Other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of investments are recognized in net income as
realized investment losses at the time when facts and circumstances indicate such write-downs are
warranted.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

The company invests in certain financial instruments, such as convertible debt and convertible
preferred stock, that contain embedded options. The embedded options are valued and accounted for
separately. The company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge
during 2001 in order to lock in an interest rate related to certain of its variable rate debt
obligations ($31 million notional amount). Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
133 “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, requires
changes in the fair value of the company’s derivative financial instruments to be recognized
periodically in income or shareholders’ equity (as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income), respectively. During 2004, the interest rate swap was terminated in connection with the
repayment of the underlying debt obligation. Neither the adoption of SFAS No. 133 nor any
subsequent changes in fair values of these instruments have had a significant impact on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Disclosures

Fair values for investments in equity and fixed-maturity securities (including redeemable
preferred stock and assets held in separate accounts) are based on either quoted market prices or
data provided by an outside resource that supplies global securities pricing.

The fair values for liabilities under investment-type insurance contracts (annuities) are estimated
using discounted cash flow calculations, based on interest rates currently being offered for
similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued.
Fair values for short-term notes payable are estimated using interest rates currently available to
the company. Fair values for long-term debentures are based on the quoted market prices for such
debentures.

2004 10-K Page 77


Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. The company provides
depreciation based on estimated useful lives (ranging from three years to 39 1/2 years) using
straight-line and accelerated methods. Depreciation expense recorded in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $30
million, $31 million and $28 million, respectively. The company reviews property and equipment for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant decreases in market
values of assets, changes in legal factors or in the business climate, an accumulation of costs
significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset, or
other such factors indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

The company capitalizes costs related to computer software developed internally during the
application development stage of software development projects. These costs generally consist of
certain external, payroll and payroll-related costs. During 2000, the company wrote off $39 million
of previously capitalized costs related to the development of next-generation software to process
property casualty policies. The write-off was included in other operating expenses in 2000.
Management conducted a review of the project, including an assessment by an independent firm, and
determined, after several deliverable dates were missed, that the project design would not perform
as originally intended. The decision required that the application software under development be
abandoned and a new application purchased. As a result of a settlement negotiated with a vendor,
2003 pretax results included the recovery of $23 million of the $39 million charge.

Federal Income Taxes

Deferred income tax liabilities and assets are computed using the tax rates in effect for the
time when temporary differences in book and taxable income are estimated to reverse. Deferred
income taxes are recognized for numerous temporary differences between the company’s taxable income
and book-basis income and other changes in shareholders’ equity. Such temporary differences relate
primarily to unrealized gains on investments and differences in the recognition of deferred
acquisition costs and insurance reserves. Deferred income taxes associated with unrealized
appreciation (except the amounts related to the effect of income tax rate changes) are charged to
shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income, and deferred taxes associated with
other differences are charged to income.

Separate Accounts

The company issues life contracts with guaranteed minimum returns, referred to as bank-owned
life insurance policies (BOLIs). Based on the specific contract provisions, the assets and
liabilities for some
BOLIs are legally segregated and recorded as assets and liabilities of the separate accounts. Other
BOLIs are included in the general account. For separate account BOLIs, minimum investment returns
and account values are guaranteed by the company and also include death benefits to beneficiaries
of the contract holders.

The assets of the separate accounts are carried at fair value. Separate account liabilities
primarily represent the contract holders’ claims to the related assets and are carried at the fair
value of the assets. In the event that the asset value of contract holders’ accounts is projected
below the value guaranteed by the company, a liability is established through a charge to the
company’s earnings. Generally, investment income and realized investment gains and losses of the
separate accounts accrue directly to the contract holders and, therefore, are not included in the
company’s Consolidated Statements of Income; however, each separate account contract includes a
negotiated realized gain and loss sharing arrangement with the company. A percentage of each
separate account’s realized gain and loss representing contract fees and assessments accrues to the
company and is transferred from the separate account to the company’s general account and is
recognized as revenue or expense. Revenues and expenses for the company related to the separate
accounts also consist of contractual fees and mortality, surrender and expense risk charges.

Earnings per Share

Net income per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each of the respective years. The calculation of net income per common share
(diluted) assumes the exercise of stock options and the conversion of convertible senior
debentures, which were issued by the company in 1992 and redeemed through 2002. Shares and earnings
per share have been adjusted to reflect all stock splits and dividends prior to December 31, 2004,
including the 5 percent stock dividend paid June 14, 2004.

Stock Options

The company has qualified and non-qualified stock option plans under which options are granted
to employees at prices that are not less than market price at the date of grant and that are
exercisable over 10-year periods. The company applies Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 25
and related interpretations in accounting for these plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has
been recognized for the stock option plans.

2004 10-K Page 78


Had compensation cost for the company’s stock option plans been determined based on the fair value
at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” the company’s net income and earnings per share would
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

In determining the pro forma amounts above, the fair value of each option was estimated on the date
of grant using the binomial option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions
used for grants in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively: dividend yield of 2.40 percent, 2.40 percent
and 2.52 percent; expected volatility of 25.65 percent, 26.03 percent and 25.90 percent; risk-free interest
rates of 4.37 percent, 4.20 percent and 4.26 percent; and expected lives of 10 years for all years.
Compensation expense in the pro forma disclosures is not indicative of future amounts as options
vest over several years and additional grants generally are made each year. Options granted under
the company’s options plans vest over three years.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25. Among other items, SFAS No. 123(R)
eliminates the use of APB Opinion No. 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires
companies to recognize the cost of associate services received in exchange for awards of equity
instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. The
effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) is the first reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005,
which is the third quarter of 2005 for calendar year companies, although early adoption is allowed.

SFAS No. 123(R) permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective or
a modified retrospective method. Under the modified prospective method, the compensation cost is
recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements
of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on the
requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS
No. 123(R). Under the modified retrospective method, the requirements are the same as under the
modified prospective method, but this method also permits companies to restate financial statements
of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with SFAS No. 123. The
company currently utilizes a standard option-pricing model (binomial option-pricing model) to
measure the fair value of stock options granted to associates. While SFAS No. 123(R) permits
companies to continue to use such a model, the standard also permits the use of a lattice model.
The company has not yet determined which model it will use to measure the fair value of associate
stock options upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

The company currently expects to adopt SFAS 123(R) effective July 1, 2005. However, the company has
not yet determined which of the adoption methods it will use. Subject to a complete review of the
requirements of SFAS No. 123(R), based on stock options granted to associates through January 2005,
the company expects that the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on July 1, 2005, will reduce both
third-quarter and fourth-quarter 2005 net income per share by approximately 2 cents per share.

In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified the consensus reached by the
Emerging Issues Task Force in Issue 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments and Its
Applications to Certain Investments” (EITF 03-1). The EITF reached a consensus on an
other-than-temporary impairment model for debt and equity securities accounted for under SFAS No.
115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and cost method
investments. The basic model developed to evaluate whether an investment within the scope of Issue
03-1 is other-than-temporarily impaired involves a three-step process including: 1) determining
whether an investment is impaired (fair value less amortized cost); 2) evaluating whether the
impairment is other-than-temporary and 3) requiring recognition of an impairment equal to the
difference between the investment’s cost and fair value. In September 2004, the FASB issued Staff
Position (FSP) No. EITF Issue 03-1-1, “Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-01.” This FSP delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition
guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of Issue 03-1 and, as of March 4, 2005, the FASB had not yet
issued guidance on the adoption or effective date of FSP No. EITF Issue 03-1-1. The amount of any
other-than-temporary impairment that may need to be

2004 10-K Page 79


recognized in the future will depend on market
conditions and management’s intent and ability to hold any such impaired securities.

The Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the AICPA issued Statement of Position 03-1
“Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration
Contracts and for Separate Accounts,” in July 2003 to be effective for the company in the first
quarter of 2004. This Statement of Position provides guidance for insurance companies for certain
nontraditional long-duration contracts (principally variable annuities with minimum death benefit
guarantees) and for separate accounts. This statement had no effect on the company’s consolidated
financial statements.

Management bases property casualty loss and loss expenses reserve estimates on company experience
and information from internal analyses, obtaining additional information from consulting outside
actuaries. When reviewing reserves, management analyzes historical data and estimates the effect of
various loss development factors.

As a result of changes in estimates of insured events in prior years, the provision for loss and
loss expenses decreased by $196 million, $80 million and $45 million in calendar years 2004, 2003
and 2002. These decreases are due in part to the effects of settling reported (case) and unreported
(IBNR) reserves established in prior years for amounts less than expected.

Following the Ohio Supreme Court’s late 2003 decision to limit its 1999

Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty
Mutual

decision, the company released $38 million pretax of previously established
uninsured/under-insured motorist (UM/UIM) reserves in 2003. In 2004, the company reviewed
outstanding UM/UIM claims for which litigation was pending. Those claims represented approximately
$37 million in previously established case reserves. During the first quarter of 2004, the company
filed motions for dismissal in various jurisdictions for specific claims and released an additional
$32 million in related case reserves. Following the release of those reserves, the company stopped
separately reporting on UM/UIM related reserve actions.

Total catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, were $148 million for 2004 compared with $97 million
in 2003 and $87 million in 2002. The majority of catastrophe losses are incurred in the calendar
year of the event.

The reserve for loss and loss expenses in the accompanying balance sheets also includes $35
million, $29 million and $26 million at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for certain
life health losses.

Life Policy Reserves

Life policy reserves have been calculated using the account value basis for universal life and

6.

Notes Payable

The company and subsidiaries had no compensating balance requirement on debt for either 2004
or 2003. The company had two lines of credit with commercial banks amounting to $250 million in
2003, of which $183 million was in use at December 31, 2003. During 2004, the company paid off
these two lines of credit. Interest rates charged on borrowings during 2004 ranged from 1.53
percent to 6.19 percent, which resulted in an average interest rate of 2.76 percent. The company
had one line of credit with a commercial bank amounting to $75 million with no outstanding
balances at year-end 2004.

The company entered an interest-rate swap agreement during 2001 to hedge future cash flows (thereby
obtaining a fixed interest rate) related to certain variable rate debt obligations ($31 million
notional amount), which would have expired in 2008. This agreement was terminated at a cost of $2
million, net of tax, in the fourth quarter of 2004. The swap is reflected at fair value on the
accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2003, and the $2 million unrealized loss, net of tax, at
December 31, 2003, is a component of comprehensive income.

7.

Senior Debt

The company issued $420 million aggregate principal amount of 6.9% senior debentures due 2028
in 1998. The company issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due 2034
in 2004. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of the senior debt approximated $843 million
and $458 million, respectively.

8.

Shareholders’ Equity and Dividend Restrictions

CFC’s insurance subsidiary declared dividends to the company of $175 million in 2004, $50
million in 2003, and $100 million in 2002. Dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted
by regulatory requirements of the insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary state. Generally, the maximum
dividend that may be paid without prior regulatory approval is limited to the greater of 10 percent
of statutory surplus or 100 percent of statutory net income for the prior calendar year, up to the
amount of statutory unassigned surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year. Dividends
exceeding these limitations may be paid only with approval of the insurance department of the
subsidiary’s domiciliary state. During 2005, the total dividends that may be paid to the company
without regulatory approval will be approximately $588 million.

The company’s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of outstanding shares. The current
repurchase program for 17 million shares was announced on February 6, 1999, replacing a program
approved in 1996 and updated in 1998. The company has purchased 13.3 million shares at a cost of
$481 million between February 6, 1999, and December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, 3.7 million
shares remain authorized for repurchase at any time in the future.

As of December 31, 2004, 4 million shares of common stock were available for future stock option
grants.

Declared cash dividends per share were $1.09, 95 cents and 85 cents for the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively.

The provision for federal income taxes is based upon a consolidated income tax return for the
company and subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2004, the company has capital loss carry forwards of
$56 million that expire in 2008 and 2009. Although realization is not assured, management believes
it is more likely
than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on the assumption that certain levels
of income will be achieved.

rates are as follows:

Filed tax returns for calendar years 2000 through 2003 are currently open with the Internal Revenue
Service. No provision was made as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, for federal income taxes on
approximately $14 million of the life insurance subsidiary’s retained earnings, since such taxes
will become payable only to the extent that such retained earnings are distributed as dividends or
exceed limitations prescribed by tax laws. The company does not contemplate any such dividend. If,
however, the entire $14 million of retained earnings becomes taxable, at the current federal income
tax rates, the tax would be approximately $5 million.

11. Net Income Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common
and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Shares and earnings per share have been adjusted
to reflect all stock splits and dividends prior to December 31, 2004.

For the company, dilutive potential common shares consist of outstanding stock options. The
computations of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:

during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, but were not included in the computation of net income
per common share (diluted) because the options’ exercise prices were greater than the average
market price of the common shares.

12. Pension Plan

The company and subsidiaries sponsor a defined contribution plan (401(k) savings plan) and a
defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. The company does not contribute
to the defined contribution plan. Benefits for the defined benefit plan are based on years of
credited service and compensation level. Contributions to the plan are based on the frozen entry
age actuarial cost method. Pension expense is composed of several components that are determined
using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method and based on certain actuarial assumptions.

The following table sets forth summarized information on the company’s defined benefit pension
plan:

The company uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans. The accumulated benefit obligation
was $142 million and $117 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value of
the company’s stock comprised $27 million (17 percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2004,
and $24 million (18 percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2003.

The company evaluates and updates pension plan assumptions annually as necessary. The
discount rate assumptions for the benefit obligation tracks with and yearly adjustments reflect
changes in Moody’s Aa bond yields. The rate of compensation increase assumptions reflect historical
calendar year compensation increases.

14. Transactions with Affiliated Parties

The company paid certain officers and directors, or insurance agencies of which they are
shareholders, commissions of approximately $11 million, $19 million and $17 million on premium
volume of approximately $76 million, $132 million and $113 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

On November 15, 2004, Cincinnati Financial Corporation repurchased 1 million shares of Cincinnati
Financial’s common stock from Robert C. Schiff, Trustee, Robert C. Schiff Revocable Trust
originally dated November 21, 2001. Robert C. Schiff is a founder of the company and retired as
director of Cincinnati Financial Corporation in November 2004. The stock was sold to Cincinnati
Financial at an aggregate purchase price equal to 99 percent of the product of (a) 1,000,000
multiplied by (b) $43.45, the last reported sale price per share of the common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market at the close of trading on November 12, 2004.

15. Contingencies

Various litigation and claims against the company and its subsidiaries resulting from normal
insurance and non-insurance activities are in process and pending. Based upon a review of open
matters with legal counsel, management believes that the outcomes of normal insurance matters will
not have a material effect upon the company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations and the outcomes of non-insurance matters will be covered by external insurance coverage
or will not have a material effect upon the company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

On June 28, 2004, Cincinnati Financial Corporation filed an application with the SEC formally
requesting an exemption for the holding company under Section 3(b)(2) of the Investment Company
Act, which permits the SEC to exempt entities primarily engaged in business other than that of
investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities.

2004 10-K Page 87


Cincinnati Financial Corporation
alternatively has asked the SEC for relief pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act
that would exempt it from all the provisions of the Act because doing so is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest consistent with the protection of investors and consistent with
the purposes intended by the Investment Company Act. The company simultaneously contacted the SEC’s
Division of Investment Management to discuss the status of Cincinnati Financial Corporation under
the Investment Company Act. The request for an exemptive order is still pending with the staff of
the SEC.

On August 26, 2004, the company announced that Cincinnati Financial Corporation transferred
approximately 31.8 million shares of Fifth Third Bancorp common stock to The Cincinnati Insurance
Company to address its status under the Investment Company Act. The 31.8 million shares had a
market value of $1.600 billion on August 26, 2004. The transfer was authorized by Cincinnati
Financial’s board of directors on August 13, 2004, and approved by the Ohio Department of Insurance
on August 24, 2004. After the contribution, the ratio of investment securities held at the holding
company level was 36.3 percent of total holding-company-only assets at December 31, 2004.

Registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which
Cincinnati Financial is operated, nor are registered investment companies permitted to have many of
the relationships that the parent company has with its affiliated companies. If it were to be
determined that the parent company was an unregistered investment company before the transfer of
equity securities in August 2004, Cincinnati Financial may be unable to enforce contracts with third
parties, and third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with Cincinnati
Financial undertaken during the period that it was an unregistered investment company, subject to
equitable considerations set forth in the Investment Company Act. As a result, it could be
determined that holders of Cincinnati Financial’s $420 million aggregate principal amount of 6.9%
Senior Debentures due 2028 have a right to rescind such indebtedness, thereby requiring Cincinnati
Financial to immediately repay such amounts. Cincinnati Financial may be unable to refinance such
obligations on acceptable terms as a result of its potential status under the Investment Company
Act. However, Cincinnati Financial currently has available sufficient assets to fund such repayment
and believes that its assets are adequate to meet its short- and long-term obligations.

17. Segment Information

The company operates primarily in two industries, property casualty insurance and life
insurance. Company management regularly reviews four reportable segments to make decisions about
allocating resources and to assess performance:

•

commercial lines property casualty insurance

•

personal lines property casualty insurance

•

life insurance

•

investment operations

Operations of the parent company, CFC Investment Company and CinFin Capital Management Company
(excluding investment activities) and other income of the insurance subsidiaries are reported as
Other.

Revenues are primarily from unaffiliated customers.

•

Revenue for all three insurance segments is insurance premiums earned. Life insurance segment revenue also
includes fees from separate account investment management fees.

•

Investment operations segment revenue is pretax net investment income plus realized investment gains and losses

•

Other revenue is primarily finance/lease income

•

Income (loss) before income taxes for each segment is based on the nature of that business area’s operations:

•

Income before income taxes for the insurance segments is defined as underwriting income (loss).

o

Commercial lines and personal lines insurance segments — underwriting income (loss) is
premiums earned minus loss and loss expenses incurred or policyholder benefits and
underwriting expenses

o

Life insurance segment — underwriting income (loss) is premiums earned and separate
account investment management fees, less contract holder benefits incurred and expenses
incurred, plus investment interest credited to contract holders

•

Income before income taxes for the investment operations segment
is net investment income plus realized investment gains and losses
for all fixed maturity and equity security investments of the
entire company, less interest credited to contract holders of the
life insurance segment.

•

Loss before income taxes for the Other category is primarily due
to interest expense from debt of the parent company and operating
expenses of the company’s headquarters.

Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective segment’s operations.
Identifiable assets are not separately reported for two reportable segments – commercial lines and
personal lines of property casualty insurance – because company management does not use this
measure to analyze those segments. All fixed maturity and equity security investment assets,
regardless of ownership, are included in the investment operations segment.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

There were no disagreements with the independent registered public accounting firm on
accounting and financial disclosure during the last two fiscal years.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Cincinnati Financial Corporation’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of December 31, 2004, an evaluation was performed under the
supervision, and with the participation, of management, including the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation as of December 31, 2004, management
concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified by SEC rules and forms. Additionally, there were no changes in the company’s
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2004,
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s responsibilities relating to establishing and maintaining effective disclosure
controls and procedures include maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
that are designed to produce reliable financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. As disclosed in the Management’s Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, management assessed the company’s system of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, in relation to criteria for effective control over
financial reporting as described in “Internal Control – Integral Framework,” issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment,
management believes that its system of internal control over financial reporting met those criteria
and was effective as of December 31, 2004.

There have been no significant changes in the company’s internal controls or in other factors that
could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to December 31, 2004.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and the Attestation Report
of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm are set forth in Item 8, Pages 70 and 71.
