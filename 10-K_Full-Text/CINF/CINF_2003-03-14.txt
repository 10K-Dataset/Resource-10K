ITEM 1. BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CFC), through its subsidiaries, operates in
the property casualty and life insurance businesses. Its property casualty
operations rank the company as one of the nation’s 20 largest property casualty
insurers, based on revenues. Over the past five years, the company’s growth has
outpaced that of the industry, with written premiums rising
at an average annual rate of 12.2 percent versus the estimated industry average
of 6.0 percent. At the same time, the company has sustained its position as one
of the most profitable property casualty insurers, with a five-year average
statutory combined ratio of 103.0 percent, excluding a one-time charge of $33
million (statutory, before tax) recorded in 2000, compared with
the estimated industry average of 109.0 percent. Investment income growth has
averaged 5.0 percent over the same period
and investment income provides the primary source of profits.

The company’s track record reflects a strong competitive position; an effective
and efficient local independent agent distribution system; continued expansion
and market penetration in operating territories; and a successful,
equity-centered investment strategy.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The company is organized and operates principally in two industries – property
casualty insurance and life insurance.

The company’s four reportable segments are:

•

commercial lines property casualty insurance

•

personal lines property casualty insurance

•

life insurance, and

•

investment operations

Segment information for revenues, income before income taxes, and identifiable
assets is included in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page
71. The company’s segments are defined based upon the components of the company
for which financial information is used internally to evaluate performance and
determine the allocation of resources.

SUBSIDIARY OVERVIEW

Cincinnati Financial had three subsidiaries at year-end 2002. The lead property
casualty insurance subsidiary, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, markets a
broad range of commercial and personal insurance policies in 31 states through
a select group of 950 independent insurance agencies. Subsidiaries of The
Cincinnati Insurance Company are The Cincinnati Casualty Company and The
Cincinnati Indemnity Company, which provide the company with flexibility in
underwriting, pricing and billing for property casualty insurance; as well as
The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company, which markets life, long-term care and
disability income policies and annuities through property casualty agencies and
independent life agencies. The Cincinnati Insurance Company and its
subsidiaries are collectively referred to as The Cincinnati Insurance
Companies.

Cincinnati Financial’s other two subsidiaries are CFC Investment Company, which
complements the insurance subsidiaries with commercial leasing, financing and
real estate services; and, CinFin Capital
Management Company, which provides asset management services to institutions,
corporations and individuals with $500,000 minimum asset accounts.



PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS

STRATEGY

The core strengths of the company’s property casualty insurance operations are
its commitment to the independent agent distribution system and the care with
which it selects the agencies that represent The Cincinnati Insurance
Companies. Its mission places agents at the center of its identity, recognizing that
locally based independent agencies have the relationships that lead to
profitable business. The company also differentiates itself by providing
exceptional claims service, through locally based field claims staff serving
the needs of agents and policyholders.

The Cincinnati Insurance Companies, which offer both commercial and personal
lines of insurance, continuously strengthen service by providing agents and
their clients a strong local presence, unparalleled claim service and
competitive products, rates and compensation.

MARKETS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION

The Cincinnati Insurance Companies market property casualty insurance policies
in 31 states. In 2002, 98.6 percent of the company’s agencies direct written
premium volume was in the 27 states in which the company has had a presence for
more than five years. Further, agencies in Ohio contributed 24 percent and
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania each contributed between
5 percent and 10 percent of premium volume in 2002.

The company selects agencies based on their commitment to the same philosophies
that distinguish the company in the marketplace: a commitment to doing business
person to person; a focus on broad, value-added services; sound balance sheets;
and, professional management. The independent agencies representing the company
are among the most successful in the country. The agencies with which the
company does business averaged approximately $12 million in total annual
premium volume for all carriers in 2000, more than two times the approximately
$5.5 million national average for 41,000 agencies, based on a Future One 2000
Agency Universe study.

In 2002, each agency representing the company averaged approximately $2.6
million in agency direct written premiums for the company, or 18 percent of the
agency’s total volume, up from $2.3 million in 2001 and $2.0 million in 2000.
No single agency accounted for more than 1.1 percent of the company’s total
agency direct written premiums. The company believes that it can continue to
increase its penetration within these agencies that share the company’s
philosophy and underwriting approach. Even if the company’s share of these
agencies’ business remains unchanged, it expects to be able to continue to grow
as the agencies expand.

Factors that distinguish the company in the insurance marketplace include:



are cancelable at any time. To serve the needs of agents and
policyholders effectively, decisions are made about both new business and
renewals that are risk-specific. Rather than stereotyping entire business
lines, the company, on a case-by-case basis, looks for equitable solutions that
allow it to select the risks it can cover on reasonable terms and at an
adequate price. This case-by-case underwriting is coordinated by the local
field marketing representatives and relies on their knowledge of the
communities in which they live and work. The company seeks to be a consistent,
predictable and reasonable carrier that agencies can rely on to serve their
communities.

•

Programs to support agency growth, including
education programs for agents and staff and financing
for buildings and equipment. In 2002, the insurance
subsidiaries augmented ongoing training programs with
a number of special events, including seminars held
around the country to encourage cross-selling by
expanding awareness of the company’s products among
producing agents. CFC Investment Company offers
convenient equipment and vehicle leases and loans for
independent insurance agencies, their commercial
clients and other businesses and also provides
commercial real estate loans to agencies to help them
operate and expand their businesses.

The success of the company’s efforts to distinguish itself in the insurance
marketplace is demonstrated by the company’s consistently high rankings in
agent and consumer satisfaction surveys. Most recently, the Florida Association
of Independent Agents reported that the company had received high marks for its
loyalty to agents and claims service. In past years, the company has obtained
similar rankings from consumer organizations and Crittenden’s Property/Casualty
Ratings. These surveys assess insurers’ accessibility and timely response,
premium pricing, efficiency and fairness of claims payments.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) Online Consumer
Information Source measures the company’s low complaint ratio (

www.naic.org

) at
0.16 versus the national median of 1.00. NAIC members head state departments of
insurance.

TECHNOLOGY-BASED TOOLS

To help solidify relationships with agencies, the company continues to invest
in and roll out technology-based tools.

•

Disaster recovery – In June 2002, the company began
initial operation of an off-site data center for company
disaster recovery needs. This facility provides an
alternate location in the event that the headquarters
data center becomes inoperable, permitting the company to
continue to serve agents. The data center complements the
company’s ongoing efforts to establish offsite locations
where associates can continue to perform key functions in
the event the company’s headquarters is not accessible.



COMMERCIAL LINES PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE

The commercial lines property casualty insurance segment contributed $1,721
million of Cincinnati Financial’s total revenues and $59 million of income
before income taxes in 2002. The company’s commercial lines property casualty
companies are licensed in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto
Rico, to serve the needs of policyholders who operate businesses in multiple
locations. Substantially all of commercial lines written premiums, however, are
for risks located within the 31 states in which the company has agent
relationships.

The company’s commercial lines products are marketed through the 950
independent agencies that represent The Cincinnati Insurance Companies. The
company’s emphasis is on providing products that agents can market to small- to
mid-size businesses in their communities. Approximately 57.5 percent of total
premiums are derived from six states: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Virginia. The premium growth rate in these six states over the
past three years has exceeded that of overall premiums as the company continues
to increase its market penetration in these areas.

Facing rising losses after years of intense price competition, the commercial
lines insurance marketplace began to experience
a firming of rates in mid-1999. Growing concerns about the economy and rising
loss severity, exacerbated by the events of September 11, 2001, led to
continued rate increases through year-end 2002. Also in
response to the rising loss severity, during this period, some competitors have
announced decisions to exit geographic markets or specific lines of business;
others have instituted across-the-board price increases. Industry analysts
believe the market has experienced a renewed sense of underwriting discipline.

The company responded to these market conditions by continuing to pursue its
case-by-case approach to new business and account renewals, seeking to further
solidify its relationships with the independent agencies and establish a basis
for continued growth. While insisting on adequate premiums for covered
exposures, the company has continued to do business the way
it always has; on the local level, focusing on each relationship separately.
Commercial lines pricing has remained flexible to respond to each risk in
partnership with local agencies, who knows their market and their business. The
company believes that this approach results in more, high-quality accounts over
the long term.

For small- to mid-size commercial customers, the company offers a variety of
insurance products. Four business lines – commercial multi-peril, workers
compensation, commercial automobile and other liability – account for 90.5
percent of commercial lines earned premiums.

•

Commercial multi-peril – Commercial multi-peril is the standard of
commercial package insurance coverages for small- to medium-sized risks. The company continues to market its products to a broad
range of business classes. Within each local market, each risk is evaluated
individually and decisions are made regarding rates, the use of three-year
policies and other policy terms. Even in classes of business that are under
pressure, such as contractors and professional liability, the company has
sought to develop underwriting guidelines that allow it to continue to be a
market for its agents and their better clients in these classes of business. In
2002, the company made carefully positioned changes to its general liability
coverage, including the application of aggregate limits, which allow it to
remain a market for agents. By year-end, these changes were in effect in 20
states and will be implemented in additional states during 2003. Further, the
company developed a contractor’s questionnaire and accelerated the use of
insurance risk reviews by field claims staff to help manage the loss ratio in
this class of business. For professional liability, the company has narrowed the underwriting
criteria and significantly increased rates.

•

Workers compensation – Conditions within the workers
compensation market have improved somewhat in the
past two years as market pricing has risen in most
states, albeit offset by continued rising trends in
loss severity. As indicated by rapid rise in premium
volume of state pools for workers compensation, many
carriers are choosing to exit significant portions of
this line of business. The company has continued to
write workers compensation, but remains highly
selective about the risks it chooses to cover. In
addition, the company has chosen not to renew
selected policies where the aggregate risk, related
to terrorism exposure, is excessive.

•

Commercial auto – The Cincinnati Insurance Companies
are one of the leading writers of commercial
automobile coverage, ranking 16th in the country
based on written premiums in 2001. The highly
competitive market over the second half of the 1990s
caused results for this line of business to
deteriorate. Following the Ohio Supreme Court’s
decisions regarding uninsured and underinsured
motorist (UM/UIM) coverage in late 2000, the company
accelerated its efforts to improve commercial
automobile underwriting and rate levels, particularly
for trucking firms. As a result of those efforts,
in 2002, the company reported a statutory losses and loss expenses ratio of
67.5 percent, putting its commercial auto profitability ahead of the estimated
industry averages.



•

Other liability – The company’s other liability
business line includes commercial umbrella,
commercial general liability and director and officer
policies. In response to rising loss severity,
however, the company’s underwriting efforts have led
to lower policy count and significantly higher
premiums for this product area. Directors and
officers coverage accounted for 11 percent of other
liability premium in 2002. Director and officer
policies are offered primarily to non-profit
organizations, reducing the risk associated with this
line of business; only 32 in-force director and
officer policies as of December 31, 2002, are for publicly traded companies
and only 10 are for Fortune 1000 companies.

The remaining 9.5 percent of commercial lines earned premiums in 2002 were
derived from a variety of other types of insurance products the company offers
to commercial customers.

PERSONAL LINES PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE

The personal lines property casualty insurance segment contributed $670 million
of Cincinnati Financial’s total revenues and
a $51 million loss before income taxes in 2002. The company markets its full
complement of personal lines products
in 25 of the 31 states in which it markets commercial lines insurance. Six
states – Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio – accounted for
72.8 percent of personal lines premiums in 2002.

The company predominantly markets homeowners and personal automobile insurance
products through 663 of the
950 independent agencies that represent The Cincinnati Insurance Companies. The
287 agencies that do not market the personal lines products either are located
in the six states in which the company does not actively market personal lines
insurance or they have decided, in conjunction with company management, that
the company’s personal lines products are not appropriate for their agencies at
this time.

Already unprofitable due to years of inadequate pricing, industry-wide personal
lines insurance saw a dramatic rise in loss ratios in 2001, primarily because
the homeowners area experienced an upswing in water damage and mold claims. In
response, insurance companies have sought rate increases and added coverage
exclusions. A number of carriers have taken dramatic steps such as restricting
new business and exiting certain territories. While the personal automobile
area has been less volatile in recent years, companies continue to seek rate
increases to keep up with increasing claim costs.

Personal automobile accounted for 58 percent of personal lines earned premium
in 2002. The company continues to seek and receive approval for appropriate
rate increases. The homeowners line accounted for 31 percent of personal lines
earned premium in 2002. To return this business line to profitability, the
company has focused on pricing and changes in policy terms and conditions. The
remaining 11 percent of personal lines earned premium in 2002 was derived from
a variety of other types of insurance products the company offers to
individuals such as inland marine, watercraft and umbrella. The company offers
its personal umbrella product, which accounted for 4 percent of total premiums
in 2002, primarily in a package with auto or homeowner coverage. Due to the
volatility of the personal umbrella product, the company has experienced rising
losses in this area, which it is addressing with rate increases and careful
underwriting.

PROPERTY CASUALTY LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVES

The consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for
unpaid losses and loss expenses of the company’s property casualty insurance
subsidiaries. The liabilities for losses and loss expenses are determined using
case-basis evaluations and statistical projections for estimates of unreported
claims and represent estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses
and loss expenses incurred through December 31 of each year. These estimates
are subject to the effect of trends in future claim severity and frequency.
These estimates are continually reviewed, and as experience develops and new
information becomes known, the liability is adjusted as necessary. Adjustments
due to prior year development are reflected in underwriting results in the year
in which they are identified.

The company does not discount any of its property casualty liabilities for
unpaid losses and loss expenses. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the company’s
liability for losses and loss expenses for 2002, 2001 and 2000 is presented in
Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, see Page 64 The reconciliation
of beginning and ending liability balances shows recognition of approximately
$45 million in redundant reserves during 2002 related to amounts held in the
reserve as of December 31, 2001, for losses and loss expenses in 2001 and prior
accident years. This redundancy was due to subsequent reserve estimates that
confirm the conservative approach the company uses when establishing adequate
reserves. Changes in calendar year 2002 to the 1992 through 1997 accident year
reserves were due to adverse developments on umbrella, commercial multi-peril,
product liability and workers compensation claims.



The anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating
liabilities for losses and loss expenses. While anticipated price increases due
to inflation are considered in estimating the ultimate claim costs, the
increase in average severity of claims is caused by a number of factors that
vary with the individual type of policy written. Average severity is based on
historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards,
policy provisions and general economic trends. These trends are monitored based
on actual development and are modified, if necessary.

The principal reason for differences between the property casualty liabilities
reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements (prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America – GAAP) and those same liabilities reported in the annual statements
(filed with state insurance departments in accordance with statutory accounting
practices – SAP or statutory), relates to the reporting of reinsurance
recoverables, which are recognized as receivables for GAAP and as an offset to
reserves for SAP.

The table below shows the development of the estimated liability for losses and
loss expenses for the years prior to 2002:

The table above presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for 1992
through 2002. The first line of data shows the estimated net liability for
unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of
the indicated years. That liability represents the estimated amount of losses
and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the
balance sheet date, including losses that had been incurred but not yet
reported to the company. The upper portion of the table shows the re-estimated
amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end
of each succeeding year. The estimate is increased or decreased as more
information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims.

Net cumulative redundancy represents the aggregate change in the estimates over
all prior years. For example, the 1992 liability has developed a $225 million
redundancy over 10 years, which has been reflected in income over the 10 years.
The effects on income in 2002, 2001 and 2000 of changes in estimates of the
liabilities for losses and loss expenses for all accident years are shown in
the reconciliation table above.



The lower portion of the development table shows the cumulative amount paid
with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each
succeeding year. For example, as of December 31, 2002, the company had paid
$794 million of the currently estimated $913 million of losses and loss
expenses
that have been incurred as of the end of 1992; thus an estimated $119 million
of losses incurred as of the end of 1992 remain unpaid as of year-end 2002.

In evaluating this information, it should be noted that each amount includes
the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods. For example, the
amount of deficiency or redundancy related to losses settled in 1997 but
incurred in 1992 will be included in the cumulative deficiency or redundancy
amount for 1992 and each subsequent year. This table does not present accident
or policy year development data, which readers may be more accustomed to
analyzing. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the
liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it
may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based
on this table.

LIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS

STRATEGY

The life insurance segment contributed $87 million of Cincinnati Financial’s
total revenues and a $12 million loss before income taxes in 2002.

Cincinnati Life’s strategic mission complements that of the overall company: to
provide products and services that attract and retain high-quality independent
agencies. The company primarily focuses on life products that will produce
revenue growth through a steady stream of premiums rather than seeking to
accumulate assets through the sale of single-premium-type policies.

Cincinnati Life seeks to round and protect accounts in the property casualty
agency. At the same time, the life operation looks to increase diversification,
revenues and profitability for both the agency and the company. This strategy
enhances the already strong relationship built by the combination of the
property casualty and life companies.

Cincinnati Life seeks to become the life insurance carrier of choice for the
independent agencies that work with the property casualty operations by
providing competitive products, underwriting, service and commissions. At
year-end 2002, 90 percent of the company’s 950 independent agencies offered
Cincinnati Life’s products to their policyholders. Term and worksite insurance
products are well suited to cross serving by the company’s property casualty
agency force. Agents find that offering worksite marketing to employees of
their small commercial accounts provides a benefit to the employees at low cost
to the employer. The life company also seeks to develop life business from
other independent agencies in a manner that does not conflict with or compete
with the property casualty agencies.

The life company offers a full line of whole, term and universal life products,
fixed annuities, disability income and long-term care products. Over the past
several years, it has worked to introduce a portfolio of new and enhanced
products, primarily under the LifeHorizons name. For example, in 2002, the life
company revised the rates for the LifeHorizons term series and introduced a new
risk classification system that better matches risk profile and rate. Other
recent launches in the LifeHorizons product series included a simplified term
policy specifically for clients of the company’s property casualty agencies.
Looking ahead, the life company plans to introduce two new, competitive
LifeHorizons guaranteed products – whole life with a single-premium paid-up
life rider and long-term guaranteed universal life – and roll out a
non-cancelable rider for its disability income insurance product. In 2003, the
life operation also will be devoting more internal resources to promotion of
its new long-term care insurance product, with a structure targeted at the
corporate market.

To augment the enhanced product line, the life operation has staffed a new
field marketing position in the western United States to complement the efforts
of the 25 life field marketing representatives in other regions of the country.

MARKETS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION

The life insurance industry was challenged in 2002 by a number of factors,
including the higher-than-historic level of bond defaults, stock market
declines that impacted variable annuities and competitive pressures that
affected rates for term products. As a result, the industry saw an overall
decline in statutory surplus, accelerated write-downs of deferred acquisition
costs and lower income. In combination, these factors resulted in ratings
downgrades for many life insurance companies during 2002.



During the same period, many large, widely known life insurance companies have
transitioned to investor-owned companies from mutual companies. Industry
analysts believe these transitions could result in accelerated consolidation in
the life insurance industry. The future presence of larger competitors could
have a negative impact on smaller, stand-alone life insurance companies because
of their potentially greater efficiency and their ability to be more aggressive
in setting prices.

Cincinnati Life believes such pressures are mitigated for the company because
of its association with the property casualty operations, its focus on the
property casualty distribution system and its careful selection of independent
agencies. Within this marketplace, Cincinnati Life is able to be competitive
and attract its share of business from the company’s agencies, especially as
other property casualty companies continue to exit the life business.

During the past three years, the company has invested in imaging and workflow
technology. As a result, the efficiency of application processing has improved
significantly. During this period, submitted applications have increased at an
annualized rate of approximately 6 percent, while staff involved with the
underwriting and policy-issue functions has declined 5 percent. This has been
accomplished while maintaining the company’s service standards.

Cincinnati Life is a financially strong and stable life insurance company.
During 2002, Cincinnati Life’s statutory surplus increased 7 percent to $408
million from $380 million at year-end 2001. Statutory surplus is one of the key
measures of an insurance company’s financial stability. A.M. Best Co. and
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services maintained their ratings for Cincinnati Life
in 2002 while Fitch Ratings initiated coverage with an AA (very strong) rating.

INVESTMENT OPERATIONS

STRATEGY

By applying a strategy that focuses on the compounding of cash flows over the
long term, Cincinnati Financial’s investment operations have contributed to the
company’s success in several ways:

•

Provided the primary source of profits. In 2002, the investment
segment contributed $351 million of Cincinnati Financial’s total
revenues and $315 million of income before income taxes.

•

Contributed to the company’s industry-leading financial strength and
stability. At year-end 2002, the ratio of property casualty written
premiums to statutory surplus was 1.12-to-1 compared with an estimated
industry average of 1.30-to-1. In addition, the company has $2.9
billion in capital at the holding company level, primarily due to
unrealized gains in the investment portfolio. This provides management
with flexibility in capitalization policies for the subsidiaries,
consequently improving the ability of the insurance companies to write
additional premiums.

•

Driven long-term growth in book value. While market conditions
resulted in a 7 percent decline in book value in 2002, over the past
five years, book value has compounded at an average rate of 4.1
percent primarily due to lower unrealized gains in the equity
portfolio.

While focused on long-term total return, the company maintains liquidity to
meet both its immediate and long-range insurance obligations with the purchase
and maintenance of medium-risk fixed-maturity and equity securities. The
emphasis is on income-producing fixed-maturity and equity securities with the
potential for long-term price appreciation. In recent years, the company’s
investment strategy has taken into account the trend toward a flatter corporate
yield curve and an overall decline in credit quality by purchasing
higher-quality corporate bonds with shorter maturities as well as tax-exempt
municipal bonds.

REGULATIONS

INSURANCE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT

The company’s subsidiaries primarily are engaged in the property casualty
insurance business, and secondarily in the life insurance business, and it is
therefore subject to regulation by the State of Ohio, the domiciliary state, as
an insurance holding company. All states have enacted legislation that
regulates insurance holding company systems such as the company and its
insurance subsidiaries. This legislation generally provides that each insurance
company in the system is required to register with the department of insurance
of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of
companies within the company which may materially affect the operations,
management or financial condition of the insurers within the company. All
transactions within a holding company affecting insurers must be fair and
equitable. Notice to the insurance commissioner is required prior to the
consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer
and of



certain material transactions between an insurer and any person or
entity in its holding company and, in addition, certain of such transactions
cannot be consummated without the commissioner’s prior approval.

The company’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision
in the states in which they do business.
In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than
shareholders. The extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its
source in statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative
powers to a department of insurance. For example, these statutes cover: the
standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing
of insurers and their agents; restrictions on insurance policy terminations;
unfair trade practices; the nature of and limitations on investments; premium
rates; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of
policy forms; periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies;
annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of
companies or for other purposes; limitations on dividends to policyholders and
shareholders; and, adequacy of provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses
and loss expenses (both reported and unreported) and other liabilities, among
other matters.

Most states have insurance laws requiring insurers to file rates, policy or
coverage forms and other information with the state’s regulatory authority.
Some states require such rates and/or forms to be approved prior to use while
others permit an insurer to begin using rates and/or forms prior to approval by
the insurance regulator. Several states exempt such filings and approvals for
commercial risks of a certain size. In all states, the insurance regulator has
the authority to disapprove a rate after it is filed. Rates proposed for life
insurance generally become effective immediately upon filing with a state, even
though the same state may require prior rate approval for other types of
insurance. Generally, the objectives of the laws governing rate filings are
that a rate must be adequate, not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory.

In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of property
casualty insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund. In the
event of the insolvency of a licensed insurer writing a class of insurance
covered by the fund in the state, members are assessed to pay certain claims
against the insolvent insurer. Generally, fund assessments are proportionately
based on the members’ market share for the classes of insurance written by the
insolvent insurer. In certain states, a portion of these assessments is
recovered through premium tax offsets and policyholder surcharges. In 2002,
assessments to the company’s insurance subsidiaries amounted to approximately
$9 million.

State insurance regulation requires insurers to participate in assigned risk
plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations, which are
mechanisms that generally provide applicants with various basic insurance
coverages when they are not available in voluntary markets. Such mechanisms are
most commonly instituted for automobile and workers compensation insurance, but
many states also mandate participation in FAIR Plans or Windstorm Plans, which
provide basic property coverages. Participation is based upon the amount of a
company’s voluntary market share in a particular state for the classes of
insurance involved. Underwriting results related to these organizations, which
tend to be adverse to the company, have been immaterial to the company or its
results of operations.

For public reporting, insurance companies prepare financial statements in
accordance with GAAP. However, certain data also must be calculated according
to statutory accounting rules as defined in the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual,
which may be, and has been, modified by various state insurance departments.

While not a substitute for any GAAP measure of performance, statutory data
frequently is used by industry analysts and other recognized reporting sources
to facilitate comparisons of the performance of insurance companies. When
appropriate, the company makes use of statutory data to analyze trends or make
comparisons to industry performance. Estimated industry data is taken from
materials published by A.M. Best, a leading insurance industry analytical and
rating organization, and presented on a statutory basis. Statutory data for the
company is labeled as such; all other data is prepared based on GAAP.

NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles (Codification)
in March 1998. Codification, which is intended to standardize regulatory
accounting and reporting to state insurance regulators, became effective
January 1, 2001. However, statutory accounting principles will continue to be
established by individual state laws and permitted practices. Ohio required adoption of Codification, with certain modifications, for the
preparation of statutory-basis financial statements effective January 1, 2001.
Codification is now incorporated into the NAIC Accounting Practices and
Procedures Manual. The effects of the company’s adoption of Codification effective January 1,
2001, are discussed below.

NAIC has risk-based capital (RBC) requirements for property casualty and life
insurers which serve as an early warning tool for the NAIC and the state
regulators to identify companies that may be undercapitalized and may merit
further regulatory action.



The formula prescribes a series of risk measurements
to determine a minimum capital amount for an insurance company, based on the
profile of the individual company. The ratio of a company’s actual
policyholders’ surplus to its minimum capital requirement will determine
whether any state regulatory action is required. At December 31, 2002, the
company’s insurance subsidiary and each of its subsidiaries had more than
sufficient capital to meet the RBC minimum requirements and had excess capacity
to write additional premiums in relation to these requirements.

EFFECTS OF CODIFICATION OF STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES

The effect of adopting Codification is reported as a cumulative-effect type
change in accounting principle for the company’s insurance subsidiaries’
statutory financial statements as of January 1, 2001. This means that the
January 1, 2001, balances of the company’s insurance subsidiaries’ statements
of admitted assets, liabilities and capital and surplus have been adjusted to
the amounts that would have been reported had Codification been in effect since
the subsidiaries began operations. Accordingly, there were significant changes
to the statutory surplus. For the property casualty companies, the changes were
deferred tax assets of $314 million, consisting primarily of taxes on the
timing of loss reserves and unearned premiums; deferred tax liabilities of $701
million, comprised mainly of taxes on net unrealized gains; guaranty fund
assessments and premium tax liabilities of $11 million; and earned-but-unbilled
premium receivables of $6 million, with a resulting decrease in surplus of $392
million. For the life company, the changes were deferred tax liabilities of $62
million, comprised mainly of taxes on net unrealized gains, and a corresponding
decrease in surplus.

Additionally, prior to 2001, the company’s property casualty insurance
subsidiaries recognized written premiums as they were billed throughout the
policy period, which was a previously acceptable method. Beginning on January 1, 2001, these companies began recognizing written premiums on an annualized
basis at the effective date of the policy as required by Codification. This
method of recognizing written premiums had no effect on statutory income or
surplus because earned premiums were unaffected. To account for unbooked
premium related to policies with effective dates prior to January 1, 2001, the
company recorded a written premium adjustment on January 1, 2001, of $402
million that appeared in the 2001 statutory financial reports submitted to
insurance regulatory authorities. Since this adjustment affected written
premiums only and was one-time in nature, it has been excluded from comparisons
of written premiums between 2002, 2001 and 2000 in this report. Written
premiums presented throughout this report for 2000 have been reclassified to
conform with the 2001 presentation based on contractual period; information was
not readily available to reclassify earlier years’ statutory data.

FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES

Although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not
directly regulate the business of insurance, federal initiatives often have an
impact on the business in a variety of ways. Some of the current and proposed
federal measures that may significantly affect the company’s business are
discussed below.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA), signed into law on November
26, 2002, provides a federal backstop for losses related to the writing of the
terrorism peril in property casualty insurance policies. Under the TRIA, the
company had until February 24, 2003, to notify commercial policyholders about
requirements of the law, let them know that the company was required to offer
terrorism coverage and let them know how the coverage would be priced.

During December 2002 and January and February 2003, the company distributed
more than 400,000 disclosure notices to
in-force commercial policyholders. The notices explained the Act and notified
them of their coverage. Except for a few select cases, full policy limit
coverage has been provided for terrorism for policyholders. The terrorism
rating plan, with rates that vary based on geographical and risk-type factors,
will go into effect in the near future. The plan will charge all commercial
policies a nominal terrorism premium to encourage them to accept coverage while
minimizing the company’s administrative costs.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB) permits mergers that combine
commercial banks, insurers and securities firms within one holding company
group. The impact on the company of the ability of banks to affiliate with
insurers is uncertain. Additionally, GLB imposed privacy protections of
consumer financial information. GLB requires financial institutions, including
the company, to protect the financial information of their policyholders and
applicants by requiring them to develop and send a notice of the institution’s
privacy practices at the inception of the relationship and annually
thereafter. The institutions must also give customers the opportunity to opt out of some
information disclosures. Most states have passed similar statutes or
regulations, many of which include health as well as financial information in
the protections. The company believes it has complied with all relevant
statutes of GLB. Further protection of consumer health information is required by regulations
promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 (HIPAA). These regulations become effective April 2003 and require health
care



providers such as doctors and hospitals, as well as health and long-term
care insurers and health care clearinghouses, to institute physical and
procedural safeguards to protect the health records of patients and insureds.
Examples of mandated safeguards include requirements that notices of the
entity’s privacy practices be sent and that patients and insureds be given the
right to access and request amendments to their records. Authorizations are
required before a provider, insurer or clearinghouse can use health information
for marketing and certain other purposes. Additionally, health plans are
required to electronically transmit and receive standardized healthcare
information.

While not directly affecting the company’s insurance business, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and regulations promulgated thereunder by the
Security and Exchange Commission, apply to the company. Sarbanes-Oxley requires
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prescribe rules to enhance the
accountability of public companies to investors and to enhance its own
enforcement powers. Rules promulgated or proposed by the SEC to date relate to:
independence of issuers’ audit committees; independence of outside audit firms;
requirements of financial experts on audit committees; certification of certain
financial reports by the chief executive officer and chief accounting officer
of the issuer; requirement of a code of ethics; design and implementation by
audit committees of a confidential and anonymous system to receive and handle
reports of complaints regarding accounting and internal controls; additional
disclosure requirements; and, enhanced civil and criminal penalties, among many
others. Additionally, an issuer’s listing exchange may prescribe additional
rules to apply to issuers listed on that exchange. The company is monitoring
the developments of these rules and is making any necessary adjustments to
ensure full compliance.

The selected financial information above allows for a more complete analysis of
results of operations and should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP
measure of performance.

As more fully discussed in the company’s Form 10-K for 2002, 2001 statutory
data for the property casualty subsidiaries reflects the company’s adoption of
Codification effective January 1, 2001. Codification of Statutory Accounting
Principles required recognition of net written premiums on the basis of the
policy contract term rather than the policy billing period. For comparison
purposes, a $402 million one-time net written premium adjustment required to conform with Codification was excluded from 2001
data, and 2000 statutory data was reclassified; information was not readily
available to reclassify earlier years’ statutory data presented above.

ITEMS 7 AND 7(A). MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the
consolidated results of operations and financial position of Cincinnati
Financial Corporation (CFC). It should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on Page 52 and
the 11-year summary of selected financial information on Pages 14 and 15.

In response to recent legislation and proposed regulations, management reviewed
its internal control structure and its disclosure controls and procedures.
While management believes the pre-existing disclosure controls and procedures
were adequate to enable the company to comply with its disclosure obligations,
management implemented minor changes as a result of such review, primarily to
formalize and document procedures already in place. The company also
established a disclosure committee that consists of certain members of the
company’s senior management.

The company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
material information, relating to the company and its subsidiaries, required to
be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management,
including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

The following discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that
involve potential risks and uncertainties. The company’s future results could
differ materially from those discussed. Factors that could cause or contribute
to such differences include, but are not limited to: unusually high levels of
catastrophe losses due to changes in weather patterns or other natural or
man-made causes; increased frequency and/or severity of claims; environmental
events or changes; insurance regulatory actions, legislation or court decisions
that increase expenses or place the company at a disadvantage in the
marketplace; adverse outcomes from litigation or administrative proceedings;
recession or other economic conditions resulting in lower demand for insurance
products; sustained decline in overall stock market values negatively affecting
the company’s equity portfolio, in particular a sustained decline in market
value of Fifth Third Bancorp shares; events as described in Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, Page 46, that could lead to a
significant decline in the market value of a particular security or sector and
impairment of assets; delays in the development, implementation and benefits of
technology enhancements; and decreased ability to generate growth in investment
income.

Further, the company’s insurance businesses are subject to the effects of
changing social, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory
initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium
rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards
and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and
regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock,
such as recent measures impacting corporate financial reporting and governance.
The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are
uncertain.

Readers are cautioned that the company undertakes no obligation to review or
update the forward-looking statements included in this material.



SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cincinnati Financial Corporation’s financial statements are prepared using
GAAP. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial
statements are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
Page 58 In conjunction with that discussion, the following reviews the
estimates and assumptions used to develop reported amounts related to the most
significant policies. Management discusses the development and selection of
these accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors
and the audit committee has reviewed the company’s disclosure relating to it in
this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE LOSS RESERVES

As discussed in the Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 64,
management establishes the company’s liabilities for insurance reserves,
including adjustments of estimates, based upon company experience and
information from internal analysis. Though uncertainty always exists as to the
adequacy of established reserves, management believes this uncertainty is
mitigated by the historic stability of the company’s book of business. Such
reserves are related to various lines of business and will be paid out over
future periods. The company monitors trends in the industry, relevant court
cases, current legislative activity and other current events in an effort to
ascertain new or additional exposures to loss. Insurance loss reserves are
affected directly by management’s reserving philosophy.

The company’s outside actuary provides management with an opinion regarding the
acceptable range for adequate statutory reserves based on generally accepted
actuarial guidelines. Historically, the company has established adequate
reserves in the upper half of the actuary’s range. This approach has resulted
in recognition of reserve redundancies over the past 10 years, which moderated
at year-end 2002 and 2001.

Modestly redundant reserves support the company’s business strategy to retain
high financial strength ratings and remain a market for agencies’ business in
all market conditions. Slowness to recognize and respond to new or unexpected
claim and loss patterns, such as those caused by the risk factors cited in the
company’s safe harbor statement, could lead to a rise in incurred but not yet
reported (IBNR) reserves. Higher IBNR would lead to a higher losses and loss
expenses ratio; each percentage point increase in the losses and loss expenses
ratio would reduce pre-tax income by $24 million based on 2002 earned premiums.

The outside actuary’s range for adequate reserves, net of reinsurance, was
$2,492 million to $2,674 million for 2002 and $2,267 million to $2,429 million
for 2001. The assumptions used to establish the recommended range for 2002 were
consistent with prior year practices as described below and in Item 1, Property
Casualty Losses and Loss Expense Reserves, Page 5. In addition, the outside
actuary undertook additional tests to reflect a change in the initial case
reserving procedures by the headquarters claims staff. The decision to
establish higher initial case reserves reflected the trend toward rising loss
severity, an industry-wide phenomenon.

The total reserve balance, net of reinsurance, at year-end 2002 was $2,608
million compared with $2,352 million at year-end 2001. See Note 4 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 64, for a reconciliation of property
casualty reserve balances with the losses and loss expenses liability on the
balance sheet. The increase in reserves in each year reflected the increases in
policies in force and coverages, loss development deterioration reflecting
larger losses and management’s conclusions regarding adequate reserve levels.
Management believes that the stability of the company’s business makes its
historic data the most important source for establishing adequate reserve
levels. Traditionally, management has conducted a thorough evaluation in the
fourth quarter of the adequacy of its reserves as of the end of the third
quarter of each calendar year. In the quarters following, changes based on that
thorough review are implemented in conjunction with the less detailed but
continuous review of reserve adequacy. As a result, the most significant
variation in reserves is seen in the fourth quarter.

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN EXPOSURES

In the normal course of its business, the company may provide coverage that
leads to highly uncertain exposures as summarized below:

•

Environmental and asbestos — Management has reviewed its exposure to
environmental risk, including mold, and asbestos risk. Management believes
that reserves are adequate at this time and that these coverage areas are
immaterial to the company’s financial position due to the types of
accounts the company has insured in the past. Factors evaluated to reach
those conclusions include:



•

Open claim counts for the long-tail asbestos and environmental losses
ranged from 400 to 600 for all three years,
or less than 1 percent of the total open claim count in each of the three
years.

•

Losses and loss expenses incurred for all asbestos and environmental
claims were $20 million, or 1.2 percent total losses and loss expenses,
in 2002, compared with $7 million, or 0.4 percent, in 2001, and $19
million, or 1.2 percent, in 2000.

•

Reserves for all asbestos and environmental claims were $71 million,
or 2.7 percent of total reserves, in 2002, compared with $63 million, or
2.7 percent, in 2001 and $62 million, or 2.9 percent, in 2000.

Commercial accounts were written by the company after the development of
coverage forms that exclude cleanup costs. The company’s exposure to risks
associated with past production and/or installation of asbestos materials is
minimal because the company was primarily a personal lines company when most
of the asbestos exposure occurred. The commercial coverage the company did
offer was predominantly related to local-market construction activity rather
than asbestos manufacturing. Further, over the past two years, the company
has revised policy terms, where permitted by state regulation, to limit its
exposure to mold and other environmental risks going forward.

•

Catastrophic events — Due to the nature of catastrophic events,
management is unable to predict precisely the frequency or potential cost
of catastrophe occurrences in the future. However, in an effort to control
such losses, the company does not market property casualty insurance in
California, reviews aggregate exposures to huge disasters and monitors its
exposure in certain coastal regions. Based on analysis of a
once-in-250-year event, the company has catastrophe exposure to hurricanes
in the Gulf and southeastern coastal regions, earthquakes in the New
Madrid fault zone (lies within the central Mississippi Valley, extending
from northeast Arkansas, through southeast Missouri, western Tennessee,
western Kentucky to southern Illinois) and tornado, wind and hail in the
Midwest and Southeast. The company uses the Risk Management Solutions and
Applied Insurance Research models to evaluate exposures and aid in
determining appropriate reinsurance coverage programs.

To help mitigate the risk of these highly uncertain exposures, the company
maintains reinsurance treaties as described below.

REINSURANCE

The company limits the maximum net loss that can arise from large risks or
risks concentrated in areas of exposure by reinsuring these risks (ceding) with
other insurers or reinsurers. The company’s property casualty risk retention
program is affected by various factors, which include, but are not limited to,
the changes in the company’s underwriting practices, the capacity to retain
risks and reinsurance market conditions.

The company has property casualty working reinsurance treaties and a property
casualty catastrophe reinsurance treaty for 2003 through reinsurers that have
written the company’s treaties for more than 10 years.

To protect against single large losses, the company purchases property casualty
working reinsurance treaties. For 2003:

•

The property working treaty ceded premiums are estimated to be $24
million compared with $25 million in 2002 and $16 million in 2001, net
of a one-time ceding commission. In 2003, the company will retain the
first $2 million of each loss, as it has for several years. It will
retain 40 percent of the next $3 million of the loss, up from 20
percent in 2002 while there was no retention on that layer in 2001.
Losses in excess of $5 million are reinsured at 100 percent up to $25
million. Terrorism losses greater than $5 million are reinsured at 80
percent, unchanged from 2002, compared with 100 percent coverage in
2001.

•

The casualty working treaty ceded premiums are estimated to be $55
million, compared with $52 million in 2002 and $32 million in 2001,
net of a one-time ceding commission. The company will retain the first
$2 million of each casualty loss, as it has for several years. It will
retain 60 percent of each loss from $2 million to $4 million, up from
40 percent in 2002 and 20 percent in 2001. Losses in excess of $4
million are reinsured at 100 percent up to $25 million. Terrorism
losses at this higher level are reinsured at 80 percent, unchanged
from last year, compared with 100 percent in 2001.

For property coverages of individual risks with insured values in excess of $25
million but less than $50 million, the company typically purchases reinsurance
(facultative) coverage under an automatic facultative treaty. For those risks
with property values exceeding $50 million, the company negotiates the purchase
of facultative coverage on an individual certificate basis. For casualty
coverages of individual risks with limits exceeding $25 million, facultative
reinsurance coverage is placed on an individual certificate basis.



To protect against catastrophic events, the company purchases property
catastrophe reinsurance. Under the 2003 treaty, ceded premiums are estimated to
be $20 million, up from $19 million in 2002 and $13 million in 2001. The
company will retain the first $25 million of losses arising out of a single
event, as it has done for several years. It will retain 43 percent of losses
from $25 million to $45 million as it did in 2002, an increase from 5 percent
in 2001. It will retain 5 percent of losses from $45 million to $200 million.
In mid-2002, the company expanded the property catastrophe reinsurance program,
adding another $100 million layer in excess of $200 million and retaining 50
percent of the losses in this layer. For 2003, the company will reduce its
retention of losses between $200 million and $300 million to 5 percent. The
company increased its catastrophe coverage because of its increased exposure
due to company growth.

The company also has traditionally purchased a reinsurance treaty that provides
an additional $25 million in casualty loss protection, notably for workers
compensation losses, bad faith losses and “clash coverage” when there is a
single occurrence involving multiple insureds or multiple policies for one
insured. The company purchases surety reinsurance in a separate contract.

All reinsurance agreements in place in 2003 are similar to those for 2002, with
modestly higher retention levels and an estimated incremental cost increase,
net of tax, of $4 million, or 2 cents per share. The company has the financial
ability to absorb losses at these levels, and the 2003 reinsurance agreement is
a means of balancing reinsurance costs and risks.

Management evaluates terrorism exposure based on aggregate exposure to class of
risk. As of the November 26, 2002 enactment of the TRIA, only approximately 120
of the company’s commercial lines policies had terrorism exclusions endorsed.
Under the 2003 property casualty working treaties, the company’s terrorism
reinsurance coverage has limitations in addition to higher retentions. Coverage
is more limited for terrorism than for other causes of loss in the event of
multiple events during the same calendar year. Under the catastrophe cover,
there is no terrorism coverage for nuclear, pollution or contamination events.
For other catastrophic terrorism losses, the company has obtained coverage for
personal lines and some limited coverage for commercial lines. Due to the
company’s focus on small- to medium-sized businesses in smaller markets and the
belief that these policyholders are not likely terrorism targets, as well as
the availability of reinsurance, the company remains willing
to continue to underwrite terrorism losses.

LIFE INSURANCE POLICY RESERVES

Reserves for traditional life insurance policies are based on expected
expenses, mortality, withdrawal rates and investment yields, including a
provision for adverse deviation. Once these assumptions are established, they
generally are maintained throughout the lives of the contracts. Expected
mortality is derived primarily from industry experience. Withdrawal rates are
based on company and industry experience, while investment yield is based on
company experience and the economic conditions then in effect.

Reserves for the company’s universal life, deferred annuity and investment
contracts are equal to the cumulative account balances, which include premium
deposits plus credited interest less charges and withdrawals.

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

The company establishes a deferred asset for costs that vary with and are
primarily related to acquiring property casualty and life business, principally
agent’s commissions, premium taxes, and certain underwriting costs, which are
deferred and amortized into income.

For property casualty policies, deferred costs are amortized over the terms of
the policies. For life policies, acquisition costs are deferred and amortized
over the premium-paying period of the policies. For accident health policies,
expenses incurred in the issuance of policies are deferred and amortized in
level proportion to gross premiums over the expected lifetime of the contract.

Underlying assumptions are periodically updated to reflect actual experience
and changes in the amounts of timing or estimated future profits will results
in adjustments in the accumulated amortization of these costs. Management does
not believe that future changes in assumptions would have a material affect on
the company.

SEPARATE ACCOUNTS

The company issues life contracts with guaranteed minimum returns, referred to
as bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLI), the assets and liabilities of
which are legally segregated and recorded as assets and liabilities of the
separate accounts. Minimum investment returns and account values are guaranteed
by the company and also include death benefits to beneficiaries of the contract
holders.



The assets of the separate accounts are carried at fair value. Separate account
liabilities primarily represent the contract holders’ claims to the related
assets and are carried at the fair value of the assets. In the event that the
asset value of contract holders’ accounts is projected below the value
guaranteed by the company, a liability is established through a charge to the
company’s earnings.

Investment income and realized investment gains and losses of the separate
accounts accrue directly to the contract holders and, therefore, are not
included in the company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Each separate
account contract includes a negotiated realized gain and loss sharing
arrangement with the company. A percentage of each separate account’s realized
gain and loss accrues to the company and is transferred from the separate
account to the company’s general account and is recognized as revenue or
expense.

In the company’s most significant separate account, realized gains and losses
are retained in the separate account and are deferred and amortized to the
contract holder over a five-year period, subject to certain
limitations. Upon termination or maturity of this separate account contract,
any unamortized deferred gains and/or losses revert to the general account. In
the event this separate account holder were to surrender the contract, there
would be a surrender charge equal to 10 percent of the contract’s account value
during the first five years, decreasing 2 percent a year to 0 percent at year
11. At December 31, 2002, net unamortized losses amounted to $5 million. In
accordance with this separate account agreement, the investment assets must
meet certain criteria established by banking regulatory authorities to whose
jurisdiction the contract holder is subject. Therefore, sales of investments
may be mandated to maintain compliance with these regulations, possibly
requiring gains or losses to be recorded, and charged to the general account.
Potentially, losses could be material; however, unrealized losses at December 31, 2002, in the separate account portfolio were $1 million.

INVESTMENTS — VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT

The company’s largest asset is its investment portfolio; and, therefore,
accounting policies relative to the investment portfolio are critical. Most of
the company’s investments are made in publicly traded securities. Valuations of
all of the company’s investments are based on either listed prices or data
provided by FT Interactive Data, an outside resource that supplies global
securities pricing, dividend, corporate action and descriptive information to
support fund pricing, securities operations, research and portfolio management.
FT Interactive Data collects, edits, maintains and delivers data on more than
3.5 million securities, commodities and derivative instruments traded around
the world. This data includes daily evaluations for more than 2.5 million
active fixed-income issues.

Changes in the fair value of these securities, based on the listed prices or
information from FT Interactive Data, are reported on the company’s balance
sheet in other comprehensive income, net of tax. Fixed maturities (bonds and
notes) and equity securities (common and preferred stocks) are classified as
available for sale and recorded at fair value in the financial statements.

The company’s investment committee and asset impairment committee continually
monitor investments and other assets for signs of impairment. Among other
signs, the committees monitor significant decreases in the market value of the
assets, changes in legal factors or in the business climate, an accumulation of
costs in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an
asset, or other factors such as bankruptcy, deterioration of creditworthiness,
failure to pay interest
or dividends or signs indicating that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable.

Declines in the market value of assets are categorized as follows:

•

Temporary declines — Temporary declines are ordinary fluctuations in
the value of a security when considered in the context of overall
economic and market conditions. Securities considered to have a
temporary decline would be expected to recover their market value.
Similar to market value gains, temporary declines (changes in the fair
value of these securities) are reported on the company’s balance sheet
in other comprehensive income, net of tax, and have no impact on net
income.

•

Other-than-temporary impairments — Other-than-temporary impairment
charges indicate a decline in valuation — often in conjunction with
events taking place in the overall economy and market, combined with
events specific to the industry or operations of the issuing
corporation — which meets specific criteria established by the asset
impairment committee. These objective measures include a declining
trend in market value, the extent of the market value decline and the
length of time over which the value has been depressed, as well as
subjective measures such as pending events and issuer liquidity.
Generally, these declines in valuation are greater than might be
anticipated when viewed in the context of overall economic and market
conditions. Impairment charges are classified as other-than-temporary
if, in management’s judgment,



there is little expectation that the
value will be recouped in the foreseeable future. A security trading
below 70 percent of book value or with a Moody’s Investors Service or
Standard & Poor’s credit rating below B3/B- is defined by the company
as distressed and monitored as potentially impaired. The security may
be written down in the event of a declining market value for four
consecutive quarters with quarter-end market value below 50 percent
of book value or when a security’s market value is 50 percent below book
value for three consecutive quarters. A sudden and severe drop in market
value that does not otherwise meet the above criteria is reviewed for
possible immediate impairment. Not withstanding the above, the company’s
portfolio managers constantly monitor the status of their assigned portfolios
for indications of potential problems or issues that may be possible
impairment issues. If a significant impairment indicator
is noted, the portfolio managers more closely scrutinize the security.

When evaluating other-than-temporary impairments, management considers the
company’s ability to retain a security for a period adequate to recover a
significant percentage of cost. Because of the company’s investment
philosophy and strong capitalization, it can hold securities that have the
potential to recover value until their scheduled redemption, when they might
otherwise be deemed impaired. Other-than-temporarily impaired investment
assets are evaluated based on their adjusted book value and further written
down, if deemed appropriate. The decision to sell or write down an asset with
impairment indications reflects, at least in part, management’s opinion that
the security no longer meets the company’s investment expectations. In
addition, because the company can hold securities trading below book value
until maturity and its criteria for determining potential impairments relate
to the magnitude of a quarter-end decline in market value or rating, the
company monitors the length of time securities in its portfolio are in a
continuous loss position only when securities have reached 70 percent of book
value. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, Page
46, for a detailed discussion of continuous loss position information for
securities trading below 70 percent of book value at December 31, 2002.

Other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of investments are recognized
in net income as realized losses at the time when facts and circumstances
indicate such write-downs are warranted.

•

Write-offs (permanent impairments) — Permanent impairments are defined as
those for which management believes there is little potential for future
recovery, for example, following the bankruptcy of the issuing
corporation. These permanent declines in the fair value of investments are
written off at the time when facts and circumstances indicate such
write-downs are warranted and reflected in realized losses.

During 2002, the company recognized $98 million, or 0.9 percent of total
invested assets, of other-than-temporary impairment charges, including $16
million from four convertible securities and $82 million from 26 fixed-income
securities. During 2001, the company recognized $45 million, or 0.4 percent of total
invested assets, of other-than-temporary impairment charges, $8 million from
two convertible securities and $37 million from 12 fixed-income securities.
Other-than-temporary impairment charges had no influence on 2000 results.
Further, $4 million, or less than 0.1 percent of total invested assets, was
deemed permanently impaired and written off in 2002 and $18 million, or 0.2
percent of total invested assets, was written off in 2001. See Results of
Operation, Page 24, for a detailed discussion.

Based on comparison of market value to book value data as of year-end 2002, 59
securities with a book value of $231 million, or 2.0 percent of total invested
assets, were being monitored due to the presence of impairment indicators.
Management believes it is unlikely that it would be required to impair the
entire value of these securities; however, in those circumstances the impact of
impairment on the company’s book value and surplus would be minimal. See
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, Page 46, for a
detailed discussion of potential other-than-temporary impairment charges.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

The company has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all
employees. Contributions and pension costs are developed from annual actuarial
valuations. These valuations involve key assumptions including discount rates
and expected return on plan assets, which are updated each year. Any
adjustments to these assumptions are based on considerations of current market
conditions. Therefore, changes in the related pension costs or credits may
occur in the future due to changes in assumptions. The key assumptions used in
developing the 2002 net pension credit were a 6.5 percent discount rate,
an 8 percent expected return on plan assets and rates of compensation increases
ranging from 5 percent to 7 percent, depending on the age of the employee. The
8 percent return on assets assumption is based on the investments of the
portfolio held by the pension plan and that substantially all of the
investments are equity securities that pay annual dividends. Management
believes this rate is representative of the expected long-term rate of return
on these assets. These assumptions were consistent with the prior year except
that the discount rate was reduced by half of one percent due to current market
conditions. Compared with the prior year, the net pension credit was reduced by
$2 million. For 2003, the company expects a net pension expense of $4 million,
primarily as a result of lower plan assets and resulting expected returns and a
decrease in the interest rate used in converting the lump sum cash out form of
payment at retirement by half of one percent. Holding all other



assumptions
constant, a half of one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would
have increased or decreased annual 2002 income before income taxes by $1
million. Likewise, a half of one percent increase or decrease in the expected
return on plan assets would have increased or decreased annual 2002 income
before income taxes by $800,000.

In addition, the estimated accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) related to the
defined benefit pension plan exceeded the fair value of the plan assets at
December 31, 2002. This was due primarily to negative returns on the pension
funds as a result of the overall decline in the equity markets and a decline in
the discount rate used to estimate the pension liability as a result of
declining interest rates in the United States. Market conditions and interest
rates significantly impact future assets and liabilities of the pension plan.
An additional liability might be required in the future, with the potential for
a charge to equity to the extent the minimum liability exceeds unrecognized
prior service cost upon measurement of plan obligations, which is usually
completed by the company at the end of each year.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The company’s adoption of SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
which requires an impairment-only approach to valuing goodwill and other
intangible assets, had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
SFAS No. 143 “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which addresses
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs, is not
applicable to the company and therefore has no impact on the consolidated
financial statements. The company’s adoption of SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for
long-lived assets to be disposed of, also had no impact on the consolidated
financial statements.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 145 “Rescission
of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections” in April 2002, which eliminates inconsistencies in
certain lease transactions, includes certain other technical corrections and
clarifies language; SFAS No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal” was issued in June 2002 and requires that liabilities for costs
associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured at fair
value when the liability is incurred; SFAS No. 147 “Acquisitions of Certain
Financial Institutions” was issued in October 2002 and relates to the
application of the purchase method of accounting and requires those
transactions be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 141 “Business
Combinations” and No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”; management
has determined that these newly issued accounting pronouncements will have no
effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

FASB issued SFAS No. 148 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition
and Disclosure” in December 2002. This pronouncement provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based compensation. In addition, more prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. The company has adopted the disclosure provisions of
this pronouncement and will adopt a transition method at the time
when a consistent fair value recognition and measurement provision is
determined by FASB (in conjunction with the international accounting standards setters) and is
required to be adopted.

FASB Interpretation 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” became
effective December 15, 2002. This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures
to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations
under certain guarantees that it has issued. Management has determined that
this interpretation will have no effect on the company’s consolidated financial
statements.

FASB Interpretation 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” was issued
in January 2003 and is effective at various dates for various requirements.
This interpretation addresses consolidation of variable interest entities
(formerly known as special purpose entities). Management has determined that
this interpretation will have no effect on the company’s consolidated financial
statements.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE-YEAR HIGHLIGHTS

Highlights of the company’s financial performance over the past three years
include:



PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Within the property casualty insurance market, the company offers both
commercial and personal policies through a network of independent agencies.
Property casualty insurance operations highlights include:

•

19.4 percent growth in statutory written premiums (14.0 percent excluding
the premium estimate adjustment) in 2002 versus the 14.2 percent industry
average. Growth in 2002 included a 17.0 percent increase in new business
premiums. The company leveraged its relationships with independent agencies to obtain firmer pricing on new and renewal business.

•

98.4 percent statutory combined ratio in 2002, compared with the estimated industry statutory combined ratio of
105.7 percent and improved from a statutory combined ratio of 103.6 percent in 2001 and 109.9 percent in 2000
(103.9 percent excluding the UM/UIM reserve addition). The estimated statutory combined ratio for the industry was 116.0 percent in 2001 and 110.1 percent in 2000.
Statutory ratios are used for comparison since GAAP-based industry data is not readily available.

•

$18 million of statutory underwriting loss in 2002 compared with underwriting losses of $108 million in 2001 and
$210 million in 2000. The underwriting results for
2000 included a $110 million pre-tax addition to
reserves, net of reinsurance, for an estimate of
past UM/UIM losses incurred but not yet reported
(IBNR) resulting from two Ohio Supreme Court
decisions that affected all insurers in the state.

•

Maintained strong ratings:

•

In May 2002, Fitch announced an initial rating of AA (very strong)
with a stable outlook based on the company’s strong financial condition
and excellent financial flexibility. Fitch commented that the property
casualty operation
is defined by strong profitability, which is derived in part by
above-average premium growth relative to its peers and strong
capitalization at the operating level. The rating also considers the
company’s significant investment concentration in common stocks.

•

In November 2002, Standard & Poor’s affirmed its AA- (very strong)
ratings with a stable outlook. This rating applies to each insurance
subsidiary based on strong competitive position, high business
persistency, strong capitalization and excellent financial flexibility.
Standard & Poor’s noted these factors are counteracted by the company’s
aggressive investment strategies and relatively slow response to
significant market changes. In 2001, Standard & Poor’s had changed its
rating of the property casualty subsidiaries to AA- (very strong) from
AA+ (very strong) in light of their outlook for the overall insurance
industry and the company.

•

In November 2002, A.M. Best affirmed its top A++ (superior) financial
strength ratings and stable outlook for the company’s property casualty
group and subsidiaries. Best cited the company’s
superior capitalization, sustained profitability and benefits from its
long-standing independent agency strategy. A.M. Best said these strengths
are somewhat offset by the company’s high investment leverage, continued
stockholder dividends and modest surplus growth caused by the recent
decline in the equity markets and operating returns that are below the
company’s historical average.

•

In November 2002, Moody’s Investors Service reaffirmed its Aa3
ratings of the property casualty subsidiaries noting key factors
including the company’s sound balance sheet, conservative leverage
profile and sizable capital base. Moody’s said that offsetting these
strengths are the company’s continued struggles with large loss severity
trends,
but pricing and underwriting initiatives should continue to offset these
patterns, which are being closely monitored by the company. Other
challenges include the risks inherent in the company’s investment
strategy, which is concentrated in a limited number of equities and
continued development for front and back-end technology systems that lag
companies of comparable size.



COMMERCIAL LINES

PREMIUM GROWTH

Commercial lines earned premiums rose 18.6 percent in 2002, or 17.6 percent
excluding the premium estimate adjustment described above, compared with 17.9
percent in 2001 and 13.2 percent in 2000. Statutory written premiums for
commercial lines of insurance grew 22.8 percent in 2002, or 15.8 percent
excluding the premium estimate adjustment, compared with the estimated industry
average of 17.9 percent. The primary source of growth in the past two years has
been firmer pricing on new and renewal commercial business, more then
offsetting deliberate decisions to not write or non-renew certain business.
In 2001, the company’s commercial lines statutory written premiums grew 16.6
percent compared with an estimated industry average of 8.1 percent.

Commercial lines premium growth in states in which the company has had a
presence for more than five years was
16.0 percent in 2002 compared with 22.9 percent in 2001, reflecting the
continued opportunities available to the company. Expansion states, where the
company has operated for five or fewer years, also were a factor in overall
growth, with agency direct premiums of $49 million in 2002 compared with $32
million in 2001 and $14 million in 2000. Over the past five years, the company
began marketing commercial lines insurance in Idaho, Montana, upstate New York,
North Dakota
and Utah.

Growth also has reflected the focus on improving customer service through the
creation of smaller marketing territories, permitting local field marketing
representatives to devote more time to each independent agent. At year-end
2002,
the company had 83 property casualty field territories, up from 74 at the end
of 2000. During 2003, the company plans to split and staff another six
territories. Smaller territories allow marketing representatives to increase
the level of service as well as expand the opportunities to ask for and earn
new business.

The company’s standard approach is to write three-year policies, a competitive
advantage in the commercial lines market. Exceptions have traditionally
included some business new to the agency, aggressively priced policies or
policies for which facultative reinsurance has been purchased. Though the
company commits to a three-year policy term, policies are annually renewable at
the discretion of the policyholder and are cancelable at any time. In 2002, the
company wrote a higher-than-normal number of one-year policies while awaiting
state regulatory approval for the addition of aggregate limits to the company’s
general liability and umbrella coverage forms. These policies would normally
have been written on a three-year basis. The changes to the general liability
and umbrella coverage limits bring the company in line with
industry practices. In 2003, the company expects to resume writing three-year policies at its
normal pace because of the competitive advantages.



While writing three-year policies would appear to restrict opportunities to
quickly adjust pricing, annual adjustments are in fact made within multi-year
packages to automobile, workers compensation, professional liability and most
umbrella liability coverages. Management estimates that approximately 74.5
percent of 2002 commercial premium was subject to annual adjustment or
re-pricing. Rates on the remaining 25.5 percent of premium are guaranteed for
three years. Multi-year packages are offered at rates that may be slightly
higher than single-year or annually-adjusted rates. By reducing annual
administrative efforts, multi-year policies reduce the company’s and agency’s
expenses and the incentive for the policyholder to shop for a new policy every
year. Management believes that the advantages of three-year policies in terms
of policyholder retention and reduced administrative costs outweigh the
potential disadvantage of these policies in periods of rising rates. In
addition,
the company began increasing rates in 2000 and is two-thirds through the
repricing period for renewals of multi-year policies.

Premium growth in 2002 benefited from double-digit premium increases for most
commercial lines of business on relatively constant policy counts. The company
is more aggressively identifying and measuring exposures to match coverage
amounts and premiums to the risk. Where this matching is not possible, accounts
are not being renewed. Agents agree on the need to carefully select risks and
restore pricing adequacy. They appreciate the time the company’s associates
invest in creating solutions for their clients while protecting profitability,
whether that means working on an individual case or developing modified policy
terms and conditions that preserve flexibility, choice and other sales
advantages.

Based on billed written premiums directly by agencies, in 2002, commercial
annualized new business premiums were
$251 million compared with $220 million in 2001 and $230 million in 2000.
Locally based field marketing representatives, who work with agencies to
underwrite and price business based on personal and direct knowledge of the
risk and competitive environment, lead the new business effort. Overall growth
of new business in 2002 was affected by the company’s decision to selectively
reduce workers compensation writings. On the basis of billed written premiums
directly, new workers compensation premiums declined 17.4 percent in 2002 and
18.4 percent in 2001, compared with a 55.4 percent increase in 2000.

The company has tightened underwriting of new and renewal business, writing new
business on a case-by-case basis and offering one-year policies where
competition or reinsurance arrangements makes multi-year policies impractical.
Over the past three years, the growth rate for individual business lines within
the commercial lines segment has shown the company’s emphasis on obtaining
adequate pricing for the covered risk:

•

Commercial multi-peril — Earned premiums grew 13.2 percent, 15.8 percent
and 13.5 percent in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As noted above, the
company wrote a higher than normal number of one-year policies in 2002
pending regulatory approval for changes in policy terms and conditions.
Commercial multi-peril premium growth slowed as some policies previously
written in a premium
discounted package were moved to non-discounted package programs, which are
included in the other liability line of business. This change reflected firmer
pricing within the marketplace.

•

Workers compensation — Overall growth was 16.7
percent due to price increases in 2002 versus 21.3
percent in 2001 and 12.2 percent in 2000. During
2002, the company selectively reduced its workers
compensation writings, although pricing had improved
for renewal business because of reduced credits.

•

Commercial auto — Earned premiums grew 19.8 percent,
20.9 percent and 15.9 percent in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The growth rate in commercial auto
earned premiums in 2002 was due to price increases as
the number of policies remained stable.

•

Other liability (commercial umbrella, commercial
general liability and directors and officers) -
Earned premiums grew 27.5 percent in 2002 due to a
higher number of policies written in non-discounted
programs. Other liability earned premium growth in
2001 was 4.9 percent down from 12.9 percent in 2000.

In total, commercial multi-peril, workers compensation, commercial auto and
other liability accounted for 90.5 percent of total commercial lines earned
premium in 2002 versus 91.5 percent in 2001 and 92.7 percent in 2000.

While no immediate effects are anticipated, the company reached certain
milestones in 2002 related to Web-based technology projects that make it easier
for agents to place business with the company. Agencies and field
representatives in four states now are using the company’s new commercial
policy quoting systems with six additional states planned for 2003.

PROFITABILITY

The commercial lines combined ratio was 96.6 percent in 2002, an improvement
from 101.7 percent in 2001 and
115.2 percent in 2000 (106.8 percent when the UM/UIM reserve is excluded).
Catastrophe losses contributed 2.3 percent,
1.9 percent and 1.5 percent to the commercial lines losses and loss expenses
and combined ratios in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.



LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES ANALYSIS

The losses and loss expenses ratio for commercial lines was 70.3 percent in
2002, compared with 74.1 percent in 2001 and 84.1 percent in 2000 (75.7 percent
when the reserve addition is excluded). Since 2000, improvement in commercial
lines profitability has primarily been driven by pricing gains as policy count
has been relatively flat over the three-year period.
In addition, the company has focused on longer-term efforts to enhance
profitability. These have included knowing what exposures it has for each risk
and making sure it offers appropriate coverages and limits of insurance at
appropriate prices.
The company continues to develop new underwriting guidelines, to re-underwrite
books of business with selected agencies and to change policy terms and
conditions where necessary. In addition, the company continues to leverage its
strong local presence. Field marketing representatives have been meeting with
every agency to reaffirm agreements on the extent of frontline renewal
underwriting to be performed by local agencies. Loss control, machinery and
equipment and field claims representatives have been conducting on-site
inspections, with field claims representatives preparing full risk reports on
every account reporting a loss above $100,000 or on any risk of concern.

Specific actions in 2002 and 2001 have included:

•

Contractor task force — A number of initiatives resulted from this review
including the development of a supplemental application to better identify
exposures; renewing emphasis on agent and underwriter education in the
area of effective risk transfer mechanisms, particularly for
subcontractors; better managing exposures to apartment or tract housing
development; making residential contractors
ineligible for monoline umbrella treatment; and, excluding mold and external
insulating finishing system (EIFS) exposures, where allowed by state
regulations.

•

Risk-category reviews — These studies emphasized
underwriting guidelines, such as property age,
capacity and loss experience. While the company
continues to evaluate risks on their own merits,
these risk category reviews have helped it to develop
guidelines such as caps on umbrella limits for
certain severity-prone business types.

•

Commercial auto review — This program identified or
fine-tuned underwriting guidelines and procedures,
with careful attention to trucking businesses that
specialize in transporting goods for others, in some
cases on a long-haul basis.

•

General liability task force — Nearing completion,
this study is focusing on loss trends by classes of
business, severity versus frequency and other metrics
for casualty coverages. The objective is to determine
why general liability results have not responded to
the company’s other actions to improve profitability.
Task force recommendations are expected in the first
quarter of 2003.

The reserve estimation policies for the company’s property casualty business
are described under Significant Accounting Policies (see Page 18). As rate and
other actions have begun to contribute to improved overall profitability for
commercial lines, the company continually monitors the adequacy of its reserves
relative to commercial lines.

Management’s conclusions regarding reserve levels in 2002 reflected refinement
of the manner in which the value of future salvage and subrogation for claims
already incurred is estimated. Also, management increased reserves for incurred
but not yet reported losses because of higher than expected paid and/or
reported development in workers compensation, commercial casualty, commercial
umbrella and other liability lines for accident years 1999 through 2001. The
increased IBNR was due to management’s continuous efforts to achieve its best
estimates of the ultimate incurred losses and not due to any specific event or
level of claim activity in a particular line. Management monitors claim
activity and appropriately modifies amounts added to losses and loss expense
reserves via IBNR additions on an ongoing basis. The IBNR increase in 2001
primarily reflected business growth and the company’s analysis of loss trends.
The IBNR increase in 2000 primarily reflected the $103 million commercial lines
portion of the UM/UIM reserve.

Following two Ohio Supreme Court decisions, in 2000 the company established a
$110 million IBNR reserve, net of reinsurance, for past UM/UIM losses incurred
but not yet reported. The court rulings affected all auto insurers in the
state, and the company’s reserve action was intended to clear the way for
long-term performance improvements benefiting shareholders and policyholders.
Prior to the establishment of the reserve, the company had incurred losses in
2000 and
1999 of $28 million and $12 million, respectively, related to these claims. In
2001, the company reduced the IBNR reserve by $54 million for claims reported
during the year and changes in case reserves. In 2002, the company reduced the
IBNR reserve by an additional $30 million for claims reported during the year
and changes in case reserves; however, the rate at which new claims are being
presented has declined and favorable development on older claims is appearing.
Management believes the reserve balance, which stood at $26 million at year-end
2002, is adequate to cover additional claims that may be reported during 2003
and beyond. Management will continue to monitor these claims and revise its
estimates of the related ultimate liabilities and reserves accordingly.
Management also will continue to monitor cases pending before the Supreme Court
in Ohio that could alter the outlook for future UM/UIM claims either positively
or negatively.

Among other factors, an industry-wide rise in loss severity over the past
several years has resulted from escalating legal costs, medical costs and jury
verdicts. Management monitors loss data by size of loss, business line,
geographic region, agency, field marketing representative and duration of
policyholder relationship to determine if there are concentrations or trends
that require specific actions. Analysis indicated no significant concentrations
beyond that seen in higher loss ratios for certain business lines, which
management has addressed.



In addition to the renewed focus on underwriting discussed above, a number of
factors have affected profitability in the company’s four largest commercial
lines of business:



COMMERCIAL LINES LOSSES INCURRED ANALYSIS (GAAP)

Analysis of loss data by average size of loss supports management’s belief that
the industry-wide increase in loss severity is not a temporary phenomenon.
Management evaluates the trend in losses and case reserve adjustments greater
than $250,000 to track frequency and severity of larger losses and also
monitors claim activity, average claim reserves on new claims and reserve
development on large claims, as losses are settled or as reserves are
increased. Based on the trends of the past three years, management believes
that losses between $250,000 and $1 million and reserve increases greater than
$250,000 are stable as a percent of earned premiums. Management is monitoring
the level of losses greater than $1 million, however, which continue to rise as
a percent of earned premiums.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES

Commercial lines catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and before taxes, were
$40 million in 2002 compared with $28 million in 2001, which included $9
million for losses related to events of September 11, 2001. Reported direct
losses accounted for less than fourth-tenths of a percent of the $9 million and
arose from the company’s participation in an aircraft insurance pool and other
reinsurance agreements. Commercial lines catastrophe losses were $18 million in
2000.

EXPENSES

The expense ratio remained relatively stable over the past three years,
excluding the one-time charge to expense software development assets in 2000,
as the company maintained its level of investment in staff and in upgrades to
technology and facilities. While management expects overall expenses to trend
down, the commission expense ratio is expected to rise as workers compensation,
which has a low commission rate, becomes a smaller percentage of total
premiums.

POLICYHOLDER DIVIDEND EXPENSE

Policyholder dividend expense as a percent of earned premiums declined by 0.8
percentage points in 2002 and
0.3 percentage points in 2001. The improvement in the ratio in 2002 and 2001
reflected the company’s emphasis on
pricing for workers compensation as well as its decision to not write or not
renew many of these policies. Whenever possible, renewal workers compensation
policies are being written by The Cincinnati Casualty Company, which does not
offer policyholder dividends.



USAIG POOL PARTICIPATION

In 2002, Cincinnati Financial, through The Cincinnati Insurance Company,
participated in USAIG, a joint underwriting association of individual insurance
companies that collectively function as a worldwide insurance market for all
types of aviation and aerospace accounts. However, the company ceded its share
of the main USAIG pool for policy year 2002,
which resulted in a net financial impact equivalent to exiting the pool.
Cincinnati Financial’s net participation share in the main USAIG pool was 10
percent for policy years 2001 and 2000.

Due to policy year 2001 rate increases that were booked in 2002, the company
recorded a USAIG-related underwriting gain
of $10 million for 2002 versus underwriting losses of $3 million and $2 million
for 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The 2001 underwriting loss included $4 million related to the events of
September 11, 2001, and the American Airlines
flight 587 accident in Queens, New York, in November 2001.

For participants in the USAIG main pool, each member’s share of premiums,
losses, expenses and profits is proportionate to its contracted participation
level during the years they participate in the pool. Each member company of
USAIG adheres to financial rating, statutory surplus and security agreement
requirements. The member companies fund a trust account
at a depository bank to meet 100 percent of their respective net liabilities.

USAIG has a reinsurance program for its members. Companies participating in the
USAIG reinsurance program are all
rated A or higher by A.M. Best. Reinsurance recoverables on behalf of
unauthorized reinsurers participating in the pool are backed by letters of
credit and trust funds from these reinsurers. The pool has two governing
committees to which each member company may appoint a representative. The
general policy committee meets periodically to review, among other things,
reinsurance credit exposure, trends in the reinsurance marketplace and to
evaluate exceptions to the approved reinsurer list that may arise. The advisory
council, which includes all member companies, meets annually.

The managers of USAIG issue policies in the name of one or more of the member
companies. All business written in
The Cincinnati Insurance Company name is treated in the company’s accounts as
direct premium and losses and is then ceded to USAIG. For the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, direct business earned and then ceded was
$192 million, $57 million and $39 million, while direct losses and loss
expenses incurred and then ceded were $29 million, $314 million and $7 million,
respectively. Since The Cincinnati Insurance Company was named as the
designated insurer for American Airlines’ policy year 2000 business, the gross
losses and recoverables resulting from all American Airlines accidents were
recorded on its 2001 financial statements. Management expects to recover 100
percent of the reinsurance recoverables associated with these accidents.



PERSONAL LINES

GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY

Personal lines earned premiums rose 8.1 percent in 2002, compared with 4.0
percent in 2001 and 4.6 percent in 2000. The sources of growth in the past
three years were rate increases on new and renewal personal lines business, as
well as increased opportunities to write new accounts as agencies and
policyholders in the uncertain marketplace are attracted to the company’s fair
pricing and long-term approach. Statutory written premiums for personal lines
of insurance grew 11.0 percent in 2002, or 9.8 percent excluding the premium
estimate adjustment, compared with 5.3 percent in 2001. In each of the past two
years, the segment’s written premiums have grown less rapidly than the overall
industry averages of 11.2 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively, as the company
has focused on underwriting actions as it seeks to return to acceptable levels
of profitability.

The personal lines combined ratio was 107.6 percent in 2002, improved from
112.4 percent in 2001 and 108.0 percent in 2000 (106.8 percent excluding the
UM/UIM reserve addition). Catastrophe losses contributed 7.1 percent, 5.8
percent and 5.4 percent to the personal losses and loss expenses ratio and the
combined ratios in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The losses and loss
expenses ratio for personal lines was 79.7 percent in 2002, compared with 82.9
percent in 2001 and 79.2 percent for 2000 (78.0 percent excluding the UM/UIM
reserve addition).

While no short-term effects are anticipated, the company reached certain
milestones in 2002 related to Web-based technology projects that will make it
easier for agents to place business with the company. During its first six
months of operation, Kansas agencies processed 3,700 policies with
approximately $3 million of premium using the initial version of the new
integrated processing system for six personal lines of business. As the
technology is rolled out sequentially to other states over the next several
years, management believes the program could have a substantial positive
benefit on premium growth and evaluation of the company’s personal lines
business. The objectives are to build a single-entry data processing system to
streamline policy issue; to speed up processing time to improve cash flow; and
to offer direct billing, a feature frequently requested by agents. The total
amount capitalized for development of this new software through December 31,
2002 was $15 million.

The reserve estimation policies for the company’s property casualty business
are described under Significant Accounting Policies (see Page 18). As rate and
other actions have begun to contribute to improved overall profitability for
personal lines, the company continually monitors the adequacy of its reserves
relative to personal lines.

Management’s conclusions regarding reserve levels in 2002 reflected refinement
of the manner in which the value of future salvage and subrogation for claims
already incurred is estimated. Also, management increased reserves for incurred
but not yet reported losses because of higher than expected paid and/or
reported development in the homeowner line for accident years



1999 through 2001. The increased IBNR was due to management’s continuous efforts to achieve
its best estimates of the ultimate incurred losses and not due to any specific
event or level of claim activity in a particular line. Management monitors
claim activity and appropriately modifies amounts added to losses and loss
expenses reserves via IBNR additions on an ongoing basis. The IBNR increase in
2001 primarily reflected business growth and the company’s analysis of loss
trends. The IBNR increase in 2000 primarily reflected the $7 million reserve
for UM/UIM.

The personal auto and homeowner business lines together accounted for 89.4
percent, 89.0 percent and 88.6 percent of total personal lines earned premiums
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The following analyzes growth and
profitability for these lines separately:

•

Personal auto — Earned premiums for personal auto grew 7.9 percent, 3.8
percent and 2.8 percent in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The growth
was driven by continued market penetration with rates
remaining relatively unchanged
in 2002. Rate increases from 2.5 percent to 10.0 percent were approved in 20
states in the second half of 2002 and will contribute to earned premium
growth in 2003 and beyond.

Over the last three years, the benefits of a personal auto re-underwriting
program generally served to offset rising loss severity. The re-underwriting
program reviewed and strengthened underwriting standards, required motor
vehicle reports for many insured drivers and obtained commitments for
selected agencies to provide the company with specific premium volume
increases. Excluding salvage and subrogation reserve, the losses and loss
expenses ratio for personal auto was relatively constant at 71.7 percent in
2002, compared with 69.2 percent in 2001 and 73.3 percent in 2000.

•

Homeowner — Earned premiums for homeowners grew 10.0 percent, 6.3 percent
and 8.3 percent in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Catastrophe losses
contributed 20.3 percentage points, 23.5 percentage points and 14.8
percentage points to the homeowner losses and loss expenses in 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. Although the losses and loss expenses ratio
excluding catastrophes for the homeowner line declined to 78.3 in 2002
after rising to 85.4 percent in 2001 from 77.4 for 2000, it remained above
the 70.0 percent to 72.0 percent level the company considers acceptable.
To improve profitability in the homeowner line, the company has focused on:

•

Rate changes — In 2002, rate increases were effective in 20 active
states, with an average increase of approximately
9 percent and with three active states experiencing more than one rate
change during the year. Looking into 2003,
the company has already received approval for rate changes in 11 active
states. Management anticipates the average increase over current rates
will exceed 10 percent over the course of the year. The 2003 rate changes
affect several of the company’s largest states as measured by homeowner
premium volume. Rate changes are applied to new business



and to existing
three-year policies as they come up for renewal. At the same time, the
personal lines underwriters are focusing on insurance-to-value initiatives
to verify the company is receiving the correct level of premium for the
value of the insured risk. Significant earned premium increases are
expected over the next three years as policies renew.

•

Changes in policy terms and conditions — The company has identified
specific coverage areas for updating to increase its control over risk
and pricing. For example, the company has capped the replacement cost
coverage at 125 percent of the amount chosen by the policyholder to
insure the home; previously, full replacement coverage without
a maximum was standard for the company. For water damage, which
represented 21 percent of losses in 2002 and
18 percent of losses in 2001, the company changed its coverage form to let
policyholders choose and pay for the level of coverage they need. This
endorsement began to roll out in September 2002 in three major personal
lines states, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana, which accounted for 50.2 percent
of 2002 homeowner earned premium.

The combined impact of these changes in rates and policy terms and conditions
is seen as existing three-year policies renew. For example, in Ohio, which
accounts for 32 percent of the company’s total homeowner earned premium,
the typical renewal policyholder is experiencing approximately a 30 percent
increase in total premium for their next
three-year policy term. This reflects all rate increases, insured value and
policy changes that were effective over the policyholder’s previous
three-year policy cycle. As the company continues to work through the renewal
policy cycle, management expects to see quarter-over-quarter improvement in
earned premium and losses and loss expenses ratios
in 2003 and beyond.

PERSONAL LINES LOSSES INCURRED ANALYSIS (GAAP)

CATASTROPHE LOSSES

Personal lines catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and before taxes, were
$47 million in 2002 compared with $36 million in 2001 and $32 million in 2000.

EXPENSES

The expense ratio, excluding the one-time charge to expense software
development assets in 2000, remained relatively stable over the past three
years, as the company maintained its level of investment in staff and costs
associated with upgrading technology and facilities.

PREMIUMS

The company’s life insurance subsidiary reported 2002 statutory written
premiums of $220 million, including a single
$33 million general account BOLI policy, up from $102 million in 2001. In 2000,
written premiums were $119 million, including a single $20 million separate
account BOLI policy. Excluding BOLI premiums, written premiums rose 81.9
percent in 2002 compared with 3.0 percent in 2001 and 3.8 percent in 2000.
Written premiums have been reclassified to exclude annuity deposits not
involving life contingencies, which are not recognized as written premium under
statutory rules.
Total written premiums in 2002 included $85 million of annuities, compared with
$10 million in 2001 and $7 million
in 2000, as agents continued to market attractive annuity features including
guaranteed interest and fixed income.

New submitted applications increased 16 percent to more than 47,600 on strong
sales of ordinary life products.
Over the coming months, Cincinnati Life will enhance its disability income
policy and introduce two new, competitive LifeHorizons guaranteed
products-whole life with a single-pay paid-up life rider and long-term
guaranteed universal life.

NET INCOME BEFORE REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES

In 2002, net income before realized investment gains and losses was down 16.7
percent from 2001 in part due to increased regulatory and legal costs. In 2001,
net income before realized investment gains and losses declined 8.1 percent
from the prior year primarily due to higher expenses related to charges for
automation and policy audits and incentives. In 2000, net income before
realized investment gains and losses rose 14.9 percent, due to growth in
investment income, favorable mortality experience, expense control and
continued growth.



INVESTMENT OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Investment operations affect the company’s results of operation through the
inclusion of investment income and realized gains and losses. Investment
operations provide the company’s primary source of pre- and after-tax profits.

INVESTMENT INCOME

Pre-tax investment income reached a new record of $445 million in 2002, up 5.6
percent from the prior record of
$421 million in 2001. Pre-tax investment income grew 2.8 percent in 2001.
Growth in investment income over the past
two years has been driven by excellent cash flow for new investment and
increased dividend income from the common stock portfolio.

The advantages of the excellent cash flow have been somewhat offset by the
effect of the weak economy on overall market conditions and the challenge of
reinvesting proceeds from called or redeemed bonds at prevailing interest
rates.

In 2002, 28 of the 46 common stocks in the portfolio raised their dividends,
which should add approximately $12 million to gross investment earnings on an
annualized basis. The 10 largest holdings in the equity portfolio accounted for
approximately 90 percent of the increase in indicated annual dividends in 2002.

REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES

Realized investment losses, net, before federal taxes were $94 million in 2002
compared with realized investment losses of
$25 million in 2001 and $2 million in 2000.

Over the past three years, realized investment losses have included:

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS

In 2002, the company recorded $98 million in write-downs of securities
management deemed had experienced
an other-than-temporary decline in market value versus $45 million in 2001.
(See Investments — Valuation and Impairment discussion in Significant
Accounting Policies on Page 21 for factors considered by management.) There
were no other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded in the investment
portfolio in 2000. Write-down of the carrying value of distressed airline,
telecommunication, utility/merchant energy/trading and cable bonds represented
71.4 percent of 2002 impairment charges:

•

Airline — In 2002, management recorded other-than-temporary impairment
charges for all unsecured airline-related bonds due to the overall outlook
for that industry, even if they did not otherwise meet the impairment
criteria. Secured notes, or those that have aircraft as collateral for the
trust certificate, were not impaired except for the two carriers in
bankruptcy proceedings (UAL Corporation/United Airlines and US Airways
Group, Inc./US Airways). Management chose to record an
other-than-temporary impairment for most of the secured notes of these two
issuers due to their unique situation.



Management chose to not record an other-than-temporary impairment for most of
the secured bonds because management believed that much higher potential
values based upon underlying asset collateral were not being recognized by
the market.

•

Telecommunication — In 2002, management recorded other-than-temporary
impairment charges for two high-yield corporate bonds and one
convertible issue following the dramatic decline in industry-wide
valuations as a result of overbuilding of infrastructure, corporate
mismanagement and accounting fraud. The impact of the Global Crossing
and WorldCom bankruptcies filtered down through the entire industry.

•

Utility/merchant energy/trading — These bonds also can be divided into
unsecured notes and those with collateral in the form of pipelines,
power facilities and real estate. Valuations throughout the industry
were affected by mismanagement
of trading operations, which contributed to accounting irregularities regarding
the booking of revenue and the valuation of trading contracts.

•

Cable — Market values in this industry have suffered
in the past year in the wake of the Adelphia
bankruptcy and subsequent concerns related to
industry-wide liquidity.

REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES

In 2002, the company recorded $8 million, which included $5 million in gains
from assets sold in the normal course of the company’s investing activities,
compared with $11 million in gains in 2001 and $2 million in losses in 2000.
The company’s investment operations buy and sell securities on an ongoing basis
to help achieve its portfolio objectives. Securities sold at a loss typically
reflected management’s opinion that the security fundamentally no longer meets
the company’s investment expectations. This change in expectations forces
management to consider deviating from its typical intent to hold to maturity.
This may reflect a loss of confidence in management, a change in underlying
risk factors (such as political risk, regulatory risk, sector risk or credit
risk), or a recovery from a previously impaired value. The decision to sell
reflects management’s perception of a change in the underlying fundamentals of
the company and preference to allocate those funds to investments that more
closely meet the established parameters for long-term stability and growth.
Sales of securities that had previously been impaired or distressed securities
totaled $73 million in 2002 versus $66 million in 2001 and $124 million in
2000, with high-yield corporate bonds accounting for 35.7 percent, 42.4 percent
and 54.5 percent of these sales in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As
described in other-than-temporary impairments above, issues affecting the
airline, telecommunication, utility/merchant energy/trading and cable
industries were a primary factor in the decision to sell securities.



VALUATION OF EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES

In 2002, the company recorded $4 million in fair value declines versus $9
million in fair value increases in 2001 due to the application of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, which requires measurement of the
fluctuations in the value of the embedded derivative features in selected
convertible securities. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
Page 58, for details on the accounting for convertible security embedded
options.

OTHER

Operations of the parent company, CFC Investment Company and CinFin Capital
Management Company, excluding investment activities, and other income of the
insurance subsidiaries resulted in $14 million in revenues in 2002, up from
$13 million in 2001 and $11 million in 2000. The losses before income taxes of
$32 million, $35 million and $36 million recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, were primarily due to interest expense from debt of the parent
company and operating expenses of the company’s headquarters.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Investment operations are the company’s primary source of profits. The company
pursues a strategy of investing in
tax advantaged fixed maturities and equity securities to minimize its overall
tax liability and maximize after-tax earnings.
The statutory net underwriting losses in each of the past three years served to
further reduce the company’s tax expense.
The differences in income tax expense and the effective tax rate during the
period were primarily the company’s tax-exempt interest and dividends received
exclusion. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 66, for
detail regarding the company’s effective income tax rate.

Management anticipates that the effective tax rate will approximate 20 percent
if the company achieves its performance objectives of an underwriting profit,
growth in investment income and more normalized realized investment gains.

Reflecting that strategy, the company’s income tax expense (benefit) was $41
million, $28 million and $(9) million for
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, while the effective tax rate was 14.8
percent, 12.7 percent and (8.9) percent for
the same periods.

Cash flow from operations for each of the last three years was sufficient to
meet operating needs of the company, with short-term borrowings utilized for
financing activities during 2001 and 2000. Management believes that operating
cash flows will continue to be the primary source of funds for the company. Net
underwriting cash flows and net investment income have continued to be strong
and contributed to cash flow from operations expansion of more than $120
million over 2001 and more than $180 million over 2000. The company uses cash
provided by operations as well as cash provided by investment sales or calls
primarily to purchase additional fixed-income and equity securities, pay
dividends and repurchase stock.

Future liquidity could be affected by catastrophe losses that are in excess of
the company’s catastrophe reinsurance treaties, which provide coverage for
gross losses up to $300 million. The company has no significant exposure to
assumed reinsurance, which accounted for no more than 2.6 percent of earned
premiums in each of the last three years and is expected to remain at or near
this level in 2003. In 2003, ceded reinsurance agreements will result in higher
ceded premiums and higher retention by the company, which will increase
incurred losses. The company expects to have minimal, if any, cash requirements
related to the pension plan in 2003. However, if asset returns remain at 8
percent per year and the employee population is stable, it is possible that the
defined benefit plan may have minimum contribution requirements as early as
2004.

Common stock repurchases for treasury have continued at a steady pace over the
last several years and occur whenever management believes that stock prices on
the open market are favorable for such repurchases. At December 31, 2002, 6.8
million shares remain authorized for repurchase at any time in the future when
market conditions permit.

During 2002, the life insurance company annuity sales, including premiums and
deposit-type contract funds, were much higher than normal at $110 million
compared with $38 million and $28 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
growth in annuity sales was attributable to the fixed rates and guaranteed
income features that were attractive in 2002’s economic climate.



ASSETS

OVERVIEW

The market value of the company’s investments was $11.257 billion and $11.571
billion at year-end 2002 and 2001, respectively. These investments made up 80.1
percent of the company’s $14.059 billion in assets at year-end 2002 compared
with 83.2 percent of the company’s $13.914 billion assets at year-end 2001.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

Insurance regulatory and statutory requirements designed to protect
policyholders from investment risk influence the company’s investment decisions
on an individual insurance company basis. Cash generated from insurance
operations is invested almost entirely in five types of assets evaluated prior
to purchase based on yield and risk. The company invests primarily in publicly
traded securities, classified as available for sale in the accompanying
financial statements. The balance sheet reflects changes in the fair value of
these securities as other comprehensive income, net of tax.

Within two broad categories, fixed-income securities and equity and convertible
securities, the company invests in
five classes of assets:

FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES

At year-end 2002 and 2001, investments totaling approximately $3.305 billion
and $3.010 billion ($3.220 billion and $3.012 billion at amortized cost) of the
company’s $11.257 billion and $11.571 billion investment portfolio related to
fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2002, the company’s portfolio of
fixed-income securities had a weighted average yield-to-book of 7.4 percent, a
weighted average maturity of 10.6 years and a weighted average modified
duration of 4.9 years. For the insurance companies’ purposes, strong emphasis
has been placed on purchasing current income-producing securities.

By maintaining a well diversified, fixed-income portfolio, the company attempts
to mitigate overall credit risk. No individual fixed-income issuer’s securities
account for more than 2 percent of the fixed-income portfolio. At year-end
2002, the airline industry comprised approximately $97 million in market value
($119 million amortized cost) distributed among the three types of fixed-income
securities. Continued weak performance by the airlines could further impact the
value of the company’s holdings within this sector. See Potential Impairments,
Page 48 for further discussion.

The energy sector, which encompasses utilities and merchant trading, accounted
for $186 million in market value ($197 million amortized book value) of
fixed-income assets. Management monitors industry concentrations for
developments such as the unregulated operations of certain utilities, which may
impact the value of the company’s holdings going forward. See Potential
Impairments, Page 48 for further discussion.



See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 62, for information
regarding the maturity of the company’s fixed-income portfolio. Credit ratings
as of December 31, 2002, for the company investment portfolio, excluding common
and preferred stocks and including $4 million in government treasuries and $72
million in convertible debentures, were:

•

Investment-grade corporate bonds — At year-end 2002 and 2001, approximately $1.488 billion and $1.240
billion ($1.394 billion and $1.208 billion at amortized cost) of the investment portfolio related to
corporate bonds rated as investment grade. Bonds with a Moody’s rating at or above Baa 3 or a Standard
& Poor’s rating at or above BBB- are considered investment grade. A majority of the bonds not rated by
Moody’s are investment grade for statutory purposes and are related to small, tax-exempt bond issues.
The company seeks to balance current income with potential changes
in market value as well as changes in credit risk when determining whether or not to hold these securities to maturity.

•

High-yield corporate bonds — At year-end 2002 and 2001, approximately $630 million and $652 million
($693 million and $718 million at amortized cost) of the investment portfolio were corporate bonds
considered to be high-yield corporate bonds. Bonds with a Moody’s rating below Baa 3 or a Standard &
Poor’s rating below BBB- and non-rated bonds are considered high yield. The company’s strong capital
position permits it to invest in these securities in addition to investment-grade corporate bonds.
While such investments tend to have higher yields, they are inherently more risky and illiquid since
the risk of default by the issuer, as indicated by their ratings, is higher. Historically, they have
made a positive contribution to investment income and, in general, are less sensitive to interest-rate
fluctuations. Similar to investment-grade bonds, the company seeks to balance current income with
potential changes in market value as well as changes in credit risk when determining whether or not to
hold these securities to maturity. During 2002, the corporate bond market experienced the highest
default rates in absolute dollars since 1990-1991. In 2002, the company recorded losses in its
non-investment grade bond portfolio due to deteriorating economic conditions and tightening credit
standards. The company is taking an aggressive approach, closely monitoring this class and selling or
impairing issues that management believes may not be able to recoup lost value. See Potential
Impairments, Page 48 for further discussion.

•

Tax-exempt municipal bonds — At year-end 2002 and 2001, approximately $1.111 billion and $1.042 billion
($1.055 billion and $1.013 billion at amortized cost) of the investment
portfolio were tax-exempt municipal bonds.
The company has historically found municipal bonds attractive because
earnings on these securities are exempt from federal taxes. Because of
alternative minimum tax effects, however, the company uses a blend of
tax-exempt and taxable fixed-maturity securities. The company traditionally
has purchased municipal bonds focusing on essential services,
such as schools, sewer, water or others. While no single municipal issuer
accounts for more than 1.5 percent of the tax-exempt municipal bond
portfolio, concentrations within individual states can be high. Holdings in
the top five states — Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio and Texas — account for approximately 66
percent of the municipal portfolio.



Equity and Convertible Securities

At year-end 2002 and 2001, investments totaling $7.884 billion and $8.495
billion ($2.375 billion and $2.174 billion at cost) of the company’s $11.257
billion and $11.571 billion investment portfolio related to equity securities.

•

Common stocks – Investments in common stocks have been made with an
emphasis on securities with an annual dividend yield of 1.5 percent to 3.0
percent and a history of dividend increases. The company’s strategy in
equity investments is to identify approximately 10 companies in which it
can accumulate 5 percent to 10 percent of their common stock. While this
emphasis on a small group of equities has resulted in significant
concentrations within the portfolio, it also permits
the company to closely monitor and often develop relationships with the management of issuing companies, gaining an
in-depth understanding of their industry and outlook. As a long-term investor, the company has followed this buy-and-hold strategy
for many years, resulting in significant accumulated unrealized appreciation within the equity portfolio.

The company’s portfolio of equity investments had an average dividend yield-to-cost of 9.1 percent at
December 31, 2002.

•

Convertible securities – For more than 30 years, the company has invested
in both convertible bonds and convertible preferred stocks. These
securities are the primary trading vehicle in the portfolio. Management
believes the conversion features enhance the overall value of the security
and does not believe that investments in convertible securities pose any
significant risk to the company or its portfolio due to their
characteristics. As a class, convertible securities tend to be less
sensitive to interest-rate changes than fixed-rate securities and less
sensitive to market conditions than equity securities.

Additional information regarding the composition of investments, together with
maturity data regarding investments in
fixed-maturity obligations, is included in the Note 2 to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Page 62.

OTHER INVESTED ASSETS

Other invested assets of $68 million, compared with $66 million in 2001,
primarily consisted of mortgage loans, policy loans and notes receivable.
During 2002, the company sold an office building in downtown Cincinnati for a
net gain of $2 million, net of tax. See Item 2, Properties, Page 12, for
information regarding the company’s other real estate holdings.

LIABILITIES

OVERVIEW

At December 31, 2002, total long- and short-term debt was 7.1 percent and
insurance reserves were 47.6 percent of total liabilities, with remaining
liabilities consisting of unearned premiums, deferred income taxes, declared
but unpaid dividends and other liabilities.

DEBT

At December 31, 2002, and December 31, 2001, long-term debt consisted of $420
million and $426 million, respectively,
of which $420 million was senior debentures in both years with $6 million in
convertible debentures at year-end 2001,
which matured in 2002. The senior debenture is not encumbered by rating
triggers. The company’s excellent cash flow and strong capital position have
allowed it to minimize its reliance on debt financing although the company
utilizes a line of credit to fund short-term cash needs.

The company has two lines of credit totaling $250 million at year-end 2002.
There are two financial covenants for the company’s $175 million line of
credit. First, consolidated net worth on the last day of each fiscal quarter
shall not be less than $5.0 billion or $4.5 billion if such reduction in
consolidated net worth is due solely to unrealized losses in the company’s
portfolio of debt and equity investments; at year-end 2002, the company’s
consolidated net worth was $5.598 billion.
Second, the company’s consolidated ratio of indebtedness for borrowed money to
net worth, at any time during each fiscal quarter, shall not exceed the ratio
of 0.25-to-1.00; as of year-end 2002, the ratio of indebtedness to net worth
was 0.11-to-1.00. The company’s $75 million line of credit has no financial
covenants. Short-term interest rates will fluctuate. Every 100 basis point
increase in short-term rates will increase interest expense by $2 million,
before-tax, based on the $183 million outstanding on the two lines of credit
at year-end 2002.

During 2001, CFC Investment Company entered into an interest-rate swap as a
cash hedge of variable interest payments for certain variable-rate debt
obligations ($31 million notional amount) to better match fixed rate lease
assets with liabilities having a fixed financing rate. Under this interest-rate
swap contract, the company agreed to pay a fixed rate of interest for a
seven-year period. The contract is considered to be a hedge against changes in
the amount of future cash flows associated with the related interest payments.
Accordingly, the related unrealized gain or loss on this contract is a
component of



comprehensive income. The interest swap contract is reflected at
fair value in the company’s balance sheet. The unrealized loss at December 31,
2002 was $4 million. The net effect of this transaction was to fix the interest
cost on the short-term loan.

The company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Credit and Financial Strength Ratings

Insurers are rated on their financial strength and claims-paying ability to
provide consumers with comparative information in the insurance industry. Among
other factors, the ratings focus on items such as results of operations,
capital resources and minimum policyholders’ surplus requirements as well as
qualitative analysis.

During 2002, the company’s ratings from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and A.M.
Best remained unchanged and a new rating from Fitch was initiated at A+ (very
strong). In 2001, Standard & Poor’s had changed their rating of the company due
to their outlook for the overall insurance industry and the company.

While factors such as the company’s catastrophe exposures, investment
philosophy and bias towards incremental change with an eye toward stability
instead of quick fixes have the potential to introduce volatility, the ratings
agencies have consistently asserted that the company has built appropriate
financial strength to manage that volatility and seek higher long-term returns
for shareholders.

While management believes its financial position is strong, the rating agencies
could decide to change their ratings in the future. The following table

DIVIDENDS

Cincinnati Financial has increased cash dividends to shareholders for 42
consecutive years and, periodically, the board of directors authorizes stock
dividends or splits. In February 2003, the board of directors authorized a 12.4
percent increase in the regular quarterly dividend to an indicated annual rate
of $1.00. In February 2002, the board authorized a 6.0 percent increase; and in
February 2001, a 10.5 percent increase. Over the past 10 years, the company has
paid an average of 40 percent
to 45 percent of net income as dividends, with the remaining 55 percent to 60
percent reinvested for future growth.
The ability of the company to continue paying cash dividends is subject to
factors as the board of directors may deem relevant.

Since 1992, the company’s board also has authorized four stock splits or stock
dividends: a three-for-one stock split in 1998;
a 5 percent stock dividend in 1996; a 5 percent stock dividend in 1995; and, a
three-for-one stock split in 1992. After the most recent stock split in 1998, a
shareholder who purchased one Cincinnati Insurance share before 1957 would own
1,947 Cincinnati Financial shares if all shares from accrued stock dividends
and splits were held and cash dividends not reinvested.



COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE

The Cincinnati Financial board believes that stock repurchases can help fulfill
the company’s commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Consequently, the
company’s board has authorized the repurchase of outstanding shares.
At December 31, 2002, 6.8 million shares remained authorized for repurchase at
any time in the future. The company has purchased 1.1 million shares at a cost
of $42 million, 1.2 million shares at a cost of $46 million and 2.1 million
shares at a cost of $67 million during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. Shares repurchased total
14.1 million, at a total cost to the company of $465 million, since the
inception of the share repurchase program in 1996.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

At year-end 2002, total shareholders’ equity was 39.8 percent of total assets.

As a long-term investor, the company has followed a buy-and-hold strategy for
more than 40 years. A significant amount of unrealized appreciation on equity
investments has been generated as a result of this policy. Unrealized
appreciation on equity investments, before deferred income taxes, was $5.509
billion and $6.321 billion at year-end 2002 and 2001,
respectively. It constituted 69.9 percent of the equity investment portfolio; and, after
deferred income taxes, 65.1 percent of total shareholders’ equity at year-end
2002.

The unrealized appreciation is primarily due to the company’s holdings in Fifth
Third Bancorp (Nasdaq:FITB) and Alltel Corporation (NYSE:AT) common stock.



Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risk is the potential for a decrease in value resulting from broad yet
uncontrollable forces such as: inflation, economic growth, interest rates,
world political conditions or other widespread unpredictable events. It is
comprised of many individual risks that, when combined, create a macroeconomic
impact. Some of the risks are:

Company-specific risk is the potential for a particular issuer to experience a
decline in valuation due to the impact of sector
or market risk on the holding or because of issues specific to the firm.

•

Fraud – the potential for a negative impact on an issuer’s performance
due to actual or alleged illegal or improper activity of individuals
its employs.

•

Credit risk – the potential for deterioration in an issuer’s financial
profile due to specific company issues, problems it faces in the
course of its operations or industry-related issues.

•

Default risk – the possibility that an issuer will not make a required
payment (interest payment or return of principal)
on its debt. Generally this occurs after its financial profile has
deteriorated (credit risk) and it no longer has the means
to make its payments.

The investment committee of the board of directors monitors the investment risk
management process primarily through its executive oversight of investment
activities. The company takes an active approach to managing market and other
investment risks, including the accountabilities and controls over these
activities. Actively managing these market risks is integral to the company’s
operations and could require a change in the character of future investments
purchased or sold or require a shift in the existing asset portfolios to manage
exposure to market risk within acceptable ranges. The approach is applied daily
by investment portfolio managers to each of the five asset classes in which the
company invests.



Risks associated with the five asset classes can be summarized as follows (H –

Sector risk is the potential for a negative impact on a particular industry due
to its sensitivity to factors that make up market risk. General supply/demand
factors for an industry will be affected by market risk and will affect
companies within that industry to varying degrees.

FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES

For investment-grade corporate bonds, the inverse relationship between interest
rates and bonds prices would lead to falling bond values during periods of
increasing interest rates. Although the potential for a worsening financial
structure, and ultimately default, does exist with investment-grade corporate
bonds, their higher-quality financial profiles make credit risk less of a
concern than for lower-quality investments. The company addresses this risk by
consistently investing within a particular maturity range, which has, over the
years, provided the portfolio with a laddered maturity schedule less subject to
large swings in value due to interest-rate changes. While a single maturity
range may see values drop due to general interest-rate levels,
other maturity ranges will be less affected by those changes. Additionally,
purchases are spread across a wide spectrum of industries and companies,
diversifying the company’s holdings and minimizing the impact of specific
industries or companies with greater sensitivities to interest-rate
fluctuations.

The primary risk related to high-yield corporate bonds is credit risk or the
potential for a deteriorating financial structure.
A weak financial profile can lead to rating downgrades from the credit rating
agencies, which can put further downward pressure on bond prices. This
weakening financial picture can lead to an inability to pay corporate
obligations and to default. Interest rate risk is less of a factor with
high-yield corporate bonds, as valuation is related more directly to underlying
operating performance than to general interest rates. This puts more emphasis
on results achieved by the issuer rather than general economic trends or
statistics within the marketplace. The company addresses this concern by
focusing on issuer –
and industry-specific financial analysis and ongoing monitoring of holdings
within this asset class.

The primary risk related to tax-exempt bonds is interest-rate risk as well as
geo-political risk associated with the specific economic environment within the
political boundaries of the issuing municipal entity. The company addresses
these concerns by focusing on municipalities’ general-obligation debt and on
essential-service bonds. Essential-service bonds are key because they derive
funds from services provided by the municipality, which are vital to the people
living in the area (schools, water service, sewer service, etc.). This enhances
the ongoing need (demand) for service and thus provides stability to the
financial picture of the issuer. Another risk related to tax-exempt bonds is
regulatory risk or the potential for legislative changes that would negate the
benefit of owning tax-exempt bonds. The company monitors regulatory activity
for situations that may negatively affect current holdings and its ongoing
strategy for investing in these securities.

The final, less significant risk is a small exposure to credit risk for a
portion of the tax-exempt portfolio that has support from corporate entities,
for example bonds insured by corporate bond insurers or bonds with interest
payment made by a corporate entity through a municipal conduit/authority. While
decisions regarding these investments primarily are made based on the
underlying municipal situation, the existence of third-party insurance in the
event of default reduces risk. In circumstances in which the municipality was
unable to meet its obligations, risk would be increased if the insuring entity
were experiencing financial duress. Because of the company’s diverse exposure
and focus on higher-rated entities with strong financial profiles, the company
does not feel this is a material concern.



INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

The company recently developed financial planning models to further incorporate
analytical tools in assessing market risks. Management believes the models will
improve the company’s ability to measure the impact on bond values resulting
from changes in interest rates. Improving measurement of the impact of
interest-rate changes should allow for improved matching
of the company’s assets and liabilities.

Hypothetically, an increase in interest rates (market yields to maturity) of
100 basis points at December 31, 2002, would decrease the fair value of the
fixed-income portfolio by $161 million, or to $3.144 billion from $3.305
billion.
The interest-rate change selected represents management’s views of a shift in
rates that is quite possible over a one-year period. The rates selected should
not be considered a prediction of future events as interest rates may be much
more volatile in the future. The analysis is not intended to provide a precise
forecast of the effect of changes in rates on the company’s results
or financial condition, nor does it take into account any actions that might be
taken to reduce exposure to such risks.

EQUITY AND CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES

The primary risk related to convertible securities is similar to other
corporate fixed-income securities in terms of their sensitivity to interest
rates, credit risk and default risk. The better the financial condition of the
underlying issuer, the lower
the credit risk. However, higher-rated convertible securities are more likely
to be sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates.
Alternatively, issuers with a weaker financial profile have a higher potential
for default and lower sensitivity to interest rates. For these issuers,
operational performance is the most significant factor in valuing the security.

Common stocks are subject to a variety of risk factors encompassed within the
umbrella of market risk. General economic swings influence the performance of
the underlying industries and companies within those industries. A downturn in
the economy will have a negative impact on an equity portfolio. Industry- and
company-specific risks have the potential to substantially affect the market
value of the company’s equity portfolio. The company addresses industry- and
company-specific risks by maintaining investments in a small group of holdings
that management can analyze closely, better understanding their business and
the related risk factors.

While the company’s financial position would be affected by changes in the
market valuation of its investments, in 2002,
the company’s equity portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 Index, a common
benchmark of market performance, losing
7.3 percent versus a decline of 22.1 percent for the Index. Over the past five
years, the portfolio performed similarly, with
an average annual return of 7.1 percent compared with an average annual decline
of 0.6 percent for the S&P 500 Index. While past performance cannot guarantee
future returns, management believes the company’s investment style – focused on
companies that pay and increase dividends to shareholders – offers some
protection in down markets. A prolonged downturn in the stocks of financial
institutions would make future comparisons with the S&P 500 Index more
difficult.

At December 31, 2002, the company held six individual equity investments that
accounted for approximately 90 percent of the after-tax net unrealized
appreciation of the entire investment portfolio. The company’s largest equity
holding is
Fifth Third Bancorp common stock, of which the company held 72.8 million shares
at a cost of $283 million at December 31, 2002. The market value of the
company’s Fifth Third Bancorp position was $4.261 billion at year-end 2002, or
54.0 percent of its total equity portfolio. The after-tax unrealized gain
represented by the company’s Fifth Third Bancorp position was $2.586 billion,
or 71.0 percent of the company’s total after-tax unrealized gains at year-end
2002.
The Fifth Third Bancorp position represented $16.00 of the company’s total book
value of $34.65 per share at year-end 2002. Every $1.00 change in the market
price of Fifth Third Bancorp’s common stock has approximately a 29-cent impact
on Cincinnati Financial’s book value per share. A 20 percent change in the
market price of Fifth Third Bancorp’s common stock, which was $58.55 at
year-end 2002, would result in a $852 million change in assets and a $554
million change in after-tax unrealized gains. This would affect shareholders’
equity by 10 percent and book value by $3.43 per share.

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS

Based on an evaluation of the portfolio at year-end 2002, 59 securities trading
below 70 percent of book value are being monitored for potential
other-than-temporary impairment. These securities had a market value of $139
million and a book value of $231 million, or 2.0 percent of total invested
assets, at year-end 2002. If all securities trading below 70 percent of
book value had been written down for an other-than-temporary impairment charge,
the company would have recorded an additional $92 million in realized
investment losses, before taxes, at December 31, 2002. Of the 59 securities
trading below
70 percent of book value at year-end, the unrealized loss associated with the
22 securities trading below book value for less than four quarters amounted to
$42 million, before tax. The 37 securities trading below book value for more
than four quarters accounted for the remaining $50 million, before tax, of the
unrealized loss at December 31, 2002.



Management’s decision to continue monitoring these 59 securities reflected its
application of its asset impairment policy, which evaluates: significant
decreases in the market value of the assets; changes in legal factors or in the
business climate;
or, other such factors indicating whether or not the carrying amount may be
recoverable. Objective measures, such as a declining trend in market value,
the extent of the market value decline and the length of time in which the
value has been depressed, can be outweighed by subjective measures such as
impending events and issuer liquidity. Impairment will be evaluated, however,
in the event of a declining market value for four consecutive quarters with
quarter-end market value below 50 percent of book value or a market value 50
percent below book value for three consecutive quarters.

As discussed in Significant Accounting Policies on Page 58, when evaluating
other-than-temporary impairments, management considers the company’s ability to
retain a security for a period adequate to recover a substantial portion of
their cost. Because of the company’s investment philosophy and strong
capitalization, it can hold securities until their scheduled redemption that
might otherwise be deemed impaired. In management’s judgment, the 59 securities
trading below 70 percent of book value at year-end 2002 that were not written
down do have the potential of recovery based on analysis of economic-,
industry-
or company-specific factors. Based on its continuous monitoring of potential
impairments and if market conditions continue to be adverse, management
believes that some or all of the 59 securities being monitored as potentially
impaired, or other securities, could meet the criteria for other-than-temporary
impairment during the first quarter of 2003. Management believes that the
company could record an other-than-temporary impairment charge at March 31,
2003 in the range of $30 million to $50 million, before tax, or 0.3 percent to
0.4 percent of invested assets at December 31, 2002.

Management deems the risk related to securities trading between 70 percent and
100 percent of book value to be relatively minor and at least partially offset
by the earned income potential of these investments. At year-end 2002,
impairment to market value of all 214 securities trading in this range would
have resulted in only $80 million in additional realized investment losses,
before tax. In 2002, securities trading between 70 percent and 100 percent of
book value, which represented 7.3 percent of the total market value of the
portfolio, generated $63 million, or 14.2 percent, of total earned income.



The following table summarizes the portfolio at December 31, 2002:

(Dollars in millions)



Outlook

Management believes the outlook for the company’s results of operation and
liquidity and capital resources is positive in
2003 and beyond for a number of reasons:

•

Property casualty insurance operations – The company believes that its
strategies provide it with important competitive advantages within the
overall insurance marketplace. In the past, those advantages have led
to above average growth rates and have continued to contribute to
profitability measures well ahead of industry measures, despite the
industry-wide challenges of rising loss frequency and severity.

•

Based on the strong performance of the property casualty insurance
operations in 2002, with earned premiums rising
15.8 percent and the GAAP combined ratio at 99.7 percent, management believes its strategies to return performance
to historic levels will be successful. As a result, the company anticipates strong growth for 2003 and believes that the
full-year GAAP combined ratio should be 99.0 percent or below (98.5 percent or below on a statutory basis),
presuming catastrophe losses remain in the range of 3 percent of earned premiums and recognizing that 2003 quarterly IBNR amounts
may exceed that of 2002. Industry analysts are projecting a 102.1 percent statutory combined ratio for the property casualty
insurance industry in 2003.

•

Investment operations – To address current market conditions, the
company is shortening the duration of the fixed-income portfolio
and emphasizing higher credit quality investments. Management also
will continue to emphasize
long-term equity investments in companies with increasing sales, earnings and dividends, strong management teams
and favorable outlooks. Pending a significant shift in market conditions, however, management anticipates achieving investment
income growth in the range of 4 percent in 2003, ahead of industry averages, although at a lower pace than
the company has traditionally achieved.

•

Liquidity and capital resources – During the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, the company had realized investment losses
amounting to $152 million, $105 million and $118 million, offset by
realized investment gains of
$58 million, $80 million and $116 million, respectively. At December 31,
2002, there were unrealized investment losses in the investment portfolio
amounting to $176 million and unrealized investment gains of $5.770 billion.
Given current market conditions, the company could record additional
other-than-temporary impairment charges during 2003.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

NATURE OF OPERATIONS –

Cincinnati Financial Corporation (company), through four
insurance companies, markets insurance mainly through a network of local
independent agents. Insurance products include fire, automobile, casualty,
bonds and all related forms of property casualty insurance as well as life
insurance, long-term care, disability income policies and annuities. In
addition, the company has finance/leasing and asset management operations
through the CFC Investment Company and CinFin Capital Management Company
subsidiaries.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION –

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the company and subsidiaries, each of which is wholly owned, and
are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. All significant inter-company balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE –

Expenses incurred in the issuance of policies are
deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies. These expenses vary with
and are primarily related to acquiring insurance business, principally agents’
commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting costs. Anticipated
investment income is not considered in determining if a premium deficiency
related to insurance contracts exists. Policy premiums are deferred and earned
on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies. The portion of written
premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as
unearned premiums. Losses and loss expense reserves are based on claims
reported prior to the end of the year and estimates of unreported claims, based
upon facts in each claim and the company’s experience with similar claims. The
establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is
an inherently uncertain process. Reserve estimates are regularly reviewed and
updated, using the most current information available. Any resulting
adjustments are reflected in current operations.

The Cincinnati Insurance Companies market property casualty insurance policies
in 31 states. In 2002, 98.6 percent of the company’s agencies’ direct written
premium volume was in the 27 states in which the company has had a presence for
more than five years. Further, agencies in Ohio contributed 24 percent and
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania each contributed between
5 percent and 10 percent of premium volume in 2002. No single agency accounted
for more than 1.1 percent of the company’s total agency direct written premiums.

LIFE INSURANCE –

Traditional products require the policyholder to pay scheduled
premiums over the life of the coverage. The company recognizes premiums
received on traditional products as revenue when due.

Limited-pay products require the policyholder to pay scheduled premiums up
front but coverage is provided for an extended period. The company defers the
amount of premium in excess of the amount necessary to provide for all benefits
and expenses and recognizes it over the life of the coverage using the gross
profit method.

Universal life products include those that allow policyholders to vary premiums
at their discretion or provide benefits or permit charges that are not fixed
according to the terms of the policy. Premiums for universal life products are
not recognized as revenue when received. The company recognizes cost of
insurance charges, administration charges and surrender charges as revenue when
earned using the gross profit method.

Reserves for traditional products are based on expected expenses, mortality,
withdrawal rates and investment yields, including provision for adverse
deviation. Once these assumptions are established, they generally are
maintained throughout the lives of the contracts. Expected mortality is derived
primarily from industry experience and withdrawal
rates are based on company and industry experience, while investment yield is
based on company experience and the economic conditions then in effect.

Reserves for universal life products are equal to the cumulative account
balances, which include premium deposits plus credited interest less charges
and withdrawals. Interest rates on approximately $446 million and $344 million
of such reserves at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, are periodically
adjusted subject to economic conditions then in effect and subject to
contractually guaranteed minimum rates.



Expenses incurred in the issuance of policies, as noted above in property
casualty insurance, are deferred and amortized over the premium paying period
of the policies using the gross profit method.

ACCIDENT HEALTH INSURANCE –

Expenses incurred in the issuance of policies, as
noted above in property casualty insurance, are deferred and amortized in level
proportion to gross premiums over the expected lifetime of the contract. Policy
premium income, unearned premiums and reserves for unpaid losses are accounted
for in substantially the same manner as property casualty insurance items
discussed above.

LEASE/FINANCE –

CFC Investment Company provides auto and equipment direct
financing (leases and loans) to commercial and individual clients. Generally,
lease contracts transfer ownership of the property to the lessees at the end of
the lease terms and contain bargain purchase options. Income is recognized over
the financing term using the interest method.

Identified initial direct costs associated with the origination of a lease or
loan are capitalized and amortized, using the interest method, over the life of
the financing. These costs include, but are not limited to, finder fees, broker
fees, filing fees and the cost of credit reports.

ASSET MANAGEMENT –

As of December 31, 2002, CinFin Capital had 35
institutional, corporate and individual clients and $726 million under
management, compared with 35 clients and $663 million at December 31, 2001.
Billings are based on a fee structure calculated upon the market values of the
assets at the end of the period. Revenues are recognized as fees are earned.

REINSURANCE –

In the normal course of business, the company seeks to reduce
losses that may arise from catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable
underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of
exposure with other insurance companies and reinsurers. Reinsurance contracts
do not relieve the company from any obligation to policyholders. Although the
company historically has not experienced uncollectible reinsurance
recoverables, failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in
losses to the company. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a
manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured
policy.

The company also assumes some reinsurance from other insurance companies,
reinsurers and involuntary state pools. Such assumed reinsurance activity is recorded principally on the basis of
reports received from the ceding companies.

INVESTMENTS –

Fixed maturities (bonds and notes) and equity securities (common
and preferred stocks) are classified
as available for sale and are stated at fair values.

Unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes, are included in
shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains
and losses on investments are recognized in net income on a specific
identification basis.

Investment income consists primarily of interest and dividends. Interest is
recognized on an accrual basis and dividends are recorded at the ex-dividend
date. The interest method is used for amortizing premium for discounts on
fixed-maturity securities.

Other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of investments are recognized
in net income as realized investment losses at
the time when facts and circumstances indicate such write-downs are warranted.

FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES –

Fair values for investments in equity and
fixed-maturity securities (including redeemable preferred stock and assets held
in separate accounts) are based on either quoted market prices or data provided
by an outside resource that supplies global securities pricing.

The fair values for liabilities under investment-type insurance contracts
(annuities) are estimated using discounted cash flow calculations, based on
interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities
consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. Fair values for
short-term notes payable are estimated using interest rates currently available
to the company. Fair values for long-term debentures are based on the quoted
market prices for such debentures. Fair value of the interest rate swap is determined by a bank.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES –

The company invests
in certain financial instruments that contain embedded options, which are
stated at fair value and are attached to the host contracts, such as
convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. The company also entered into
an interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge during 2001 in order to
lock in an interest rate related to certain of its variable rate debt
obligations ($31 million notional amount). Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” as amended requires changes in the fair value of the
company’s derivative financial instruments and its interest rate swap agreement
to be recognized periodically in income or shareholders’ equity (as a component
of accumulated other



comprehensive income), respectively. Neither the adoption
of SFAS No. 133 nor any subsequent changes in fair values of these instruments
have had a significant impact on the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT –

Property and equipment is recorded at cost less
accumulated depreciation.
The company provides depreciation based on estimated useful lives using
straight-line and accelerated methods. Depreciation expense recorded in 2002,
2001 and 2000 was $22 million, $25 million and $18 million, respectively. The
company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances, such as significant decreases in market values of
assets, changes in legal factors or in the business climate, an accumulation of
costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or
construct an asset, or other such factors indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable.

The company capitalizes costs related to computer software developed for
internal use during the application development stage of software development
projects. These costs generally consist of certain external, payroll and
payroll-related costs. During 2000, the company wrote off $39 million of
previously capitalized costs related to the development of next-generation
software to process property casualty policies. Management conducted a review
of the project, including an assessment by an independent firm, and determined,
after several deliverable dates were missed, that the project design would not
perform as originally intended. The decision required that the application
software under development be abandoned and a new application purchased.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES –

Deferred income tax liabilities and assets are computed
using the tax rates in effect for the time when temporary differences in book
and taxable income are estimated to reverse. Deferred income taxes are
recognized for numerous temporary differences between the company’s taxable
income and book-basis income and other changes in shareholders’ equity. Such
temporary differences relate primarily to unrealized gains on investments and
differences in the recognition of deferred acquisition costs and insurance
reserves. Deferred income taxes associated with unrealized appreciation (except
the amounts related to the effect of income tax rate changes) are charged to
shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income, and deferred
taxes associated with other differences are charged to income.

SEPARATE ACCOUNTS –

The company issues life contracts with guaranteed minimum
returns, referred to as bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies, the assets
and liabilities of which are legally segregated and recorded as assets and
liabilities of the separate accounts. Minimum investment returns and account
values are guaranteed by the company and also include death benefits to
beneficiaries of the contract holders.

The assets of the separate accounts are carried at fair value. Separate account
liabilities primarily represent the contract holders’ claims to the related
assets and are carried at the fair value of the assets. In the event that the
asset value of contract holders’ accounts is projected below the value
guaranteed by the company, a liability is established through a charge to the
company’s earnings. Generally, investment income and realized investment gains
and losses of the separate accounts accrue directly to the contract holders
and, therefore, is not included in the company’s Consolidated Statements of
Income; however, each separate account contract includes a negotiated realized
gain and loss sharing arrangement with the company. A percentage of each
separate account’s realized gain and loss accrues to the company and is
transferred from the separate account to the company’s general account and is
recognized as revenue or expense. Revenues and
expenses for the company related to the separate accounts also consist of
contractual fees and mortality, surrender and expense risk charges.

EARNINGS PER SHARE –

Net income per common share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during each of the respective
years. The calculation of net income per common share (diluted) assumes the
conversion of convertible senior debentures and the exercise of stock options.

STOCK OPTIONS –

The company has primarily qualified stock option plans under
which options are granted to employees at prices which are not less than market
price at the date of grant and which are exercisable over 10-year periods. The
company applies Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for these plans. Accordingly, no compensation
cost has been recognized for the stock option plans.



Had compensation cost for the company’s stock option plans been determined
based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans
consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” the company’s net income and earnings per share would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

In determining the pro forma amounts above, the fair value of each option was
estimated on the date of grant using the binomial option-pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively: dividend yield of 2.52 percent, 2.20 percent and 2.11 percent;
expected volatility of 25.90 percent, 25.54 percent and 24.92 percent;
risk-free interest rates of 4.26 percent, 5.54 percent and 5.30 percent; and
expected lives of 10 years for all years. Compensation expense in the pro forma
disclosures is not indicative of future amounts as options vest over several
years and additional grants generally are made each year.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS –

The company’s adoption of SFAS No. 142
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which requires an impairment-only
approach to valuing goodwill and other intangible assets, had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 143 “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” which addresses accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
the associated asset retirement costs, is not applicable to the company and
therefore has no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The company’s adoption of SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to
be disposed of, also had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 145 “Rescission
of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections” in April 2002, which eliminates inconsistencies in
certain lease transactions, includes certain other technical corrections and
clarifies language; SFAS No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal” was issued in June 2002 and requires that liabilities for costs
associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured at fair
value when the liability is incurred; SFAS No. 147 “Acquisitions of Certain
Financial Institutions” was issued in October 2002 and relates to the
application of the
purchase method of accounting and requires those transactions be accounted for
in accordance with SFAS No. 141 “Business Combinations” and
No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”; management has determined that
these newly issued accounting pronouncements will have no effect on the
company’s consolidated financial statements.

FASB issued SFAS No. 148 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition
and Disclosure” in December 2002. This pronouncement provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based compensation. In addition, it requires more
prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of
the method used on reported results. The company has adopted the disclosure
provisions of this pronouncement and will adopt a transition method at the time
when a consistent fair value recognition and measurement provision is
determined by FASB
(in conjunction with the international accounting standards setters) and is
required to be adopted.

FASB Interpretation 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” became
effective December 15, 2002. This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures
to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations
under certain guarantees that it has issued. Management has determined that
this interpretation will have no effect on the company’s consolidated financial
statements.



FASB Interpretation 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” was issued
in January 2993 and is effective at various dates for various requirements.
This interpretation addresses consolidation of variable interest entities
(formerly known as special purpose entities). Management has determined that
this interpretation will have no effect on the company’s consolidated financial
statements.

RECLASSIFICATIONS –

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with current-year classifications, including outstanding loss checks
payable, which prior to 2002 were classified as liabilities in the balance
sheets, and now,
as a result of a new check clearing process with the company’s bank, are
included in cash.

3.     Deferred Acquisition Costs

Acquisition costs incurred and capitalized during 2002, 2001 and 2000 amounted
to $580 million, $481 million and
$438 million, respectively. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs was $523
million, $454 million and $405 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.



4.     Property
Casualty Losses and Loss Expenses

Activity in the reserve for losses and loss expenses is summarized as follows:

As a result of changes in estimates of insured events in prior years, the
provision for losses and loss expenses decreased by
$45 million, $62 million and $20 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000. These
decreases are due in part to the effects of settling reported (case) and
unreported (IBNR) reserves established in prior years for less than expected.

The reserve for losses and loss expenses in the accompanying balance sheets
also includes $26 million and $22 million
at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for certain life health losses.

5.     Life Policy Reserves

Life policy reserves have been calculated using the account value basis for
universal life and annuity policies and modifications of the 1975-80 select and
ultimate table for traditional policies. Life policy reserves are summarized as

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value associated with the annuities
shown above approximated $331 million and $213 million, respectively.

6.     Notes Payable

The company and subsidiaries had no compensating balance requirement on debt
for either 2002 or 2001. The company had two lines of credit with commercial
banks amounting to $250 million in 2002 (expiring in 2003) and $275 million in
2001, of which $183 million was in use at December 31, 2002 and 2001. Interest rates charged on such borrowings ranged
from 1.78 percent to 6.11 percent during
2002, which resulted in an average
interest rate of 3.01 percent. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the
notes payable approximated the carrying value and the weighted average interest
rate approximated
2.63 percent.



The company entered an interest-rate swap agreement during 2001, which expires
in seven years, to hedge future cash flows (thereby obtaining a fixed interest
rate) related to certain variable rate debt obligations ($31 million notional
amount). This swap is reflected at fair value in the accompanying balance sheet
and the unrealized loss, net of tax, at December 31, 2002,
of $2 million is a component of comprehensive income; the fair value was not
significant at December 31, 2001.
The company does not expect any significant amounts to be reclassified into
earnings as a result of interest rate changes in the next 12 months.

7.     Senior Debentures

The company issued $420 million of senior debentures due 2028 in 1998. The
convertible senior debentures matured in 2002 and were convertible into shares
of common stock at a conversion price of $14.88 per share (67.23 shares for
each
one thousand dollars principal). At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value
of the debentures approximated $429 million and $415 million, respectively.

8.     Shareholders’ Equity and Dividend Restrictions

The insurance subsidiaries paid cash dividends to the company of approximately
$100 million total, each year in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Dividends paid to the
company by insurance subsidiaries are restricted by regulatory requirements of
the insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary state. Generally, the maximum dividend
that may be paid without prior regulatory approval is limited to the greater of
10 percent of statutory surplus or 100 percent of statutory net income for the
prior calendar year, up to the amount of statutory unassigned surplus as of the
end of the prior calendar year. Dividends exceeding these limitations may be
paid only with approval of the insurance department of the subsidiaries’
domiciliary state. During 2003, the total dividends that may be paid to the
company without regulatory approval are approximately $234 million.

The company’s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of outstanding
shares. The company has purchased
14.1 million shares at a cost of $465 million between the inception of the
share repurchase program in 1996 and
December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, 6.8 million shares remain authorized
for repurchase at any time in the future.

Six million shares of common stock were available for future stock option
grants, as of December 31, 2002.

Declared cash dividends per share were 89 cents, 84 cents and 76 cents as of
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

10.     Federal Income Taxes

Significant components of the company’s net deferred tax liability are as
follows:

The provision for federal income taxes is based upon a consolidated income tax
return for the company and subsidiaries. Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets
will be realized based on the assumption that certain levels of income will be
achieved.

The differences between the statutory federal rates and the company’s effective
federal income tax rates are as follows:

No provision was made December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 for federal income taxes
on approximately $14 million of the
life insurance subsidiary’s retained earnings, since such taxes will become
payable only to the extent that such retained earnings are distributed as
dividends or exceed limitations prescribed by tax laws. The company does not
contemplate any such dividend.



11.     Net Income Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of
shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the
weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares
outstanding.

For the company, dilutive potential common shares consist of outstanding stock
options and shares issuable under the matured 5.5 percent convertible senior
debentures (debentures). The computations of basic and diluted earnings per
share are as follows:

Options to purchase 1 million shares of common stock were outstanding during
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, but were not included in the computation of
net income per common share (diluted) because the options’ exercise prices were
greater than the average market price of the common shares.

12.     Pension Plan

The company and subsidiaries sponsor a defined contribution plan (401(k)
savings plan) and a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all
employees. Benefits for the defined benefit plan are based on years of credited
service and compensation level. Contributions to the plan are based on the
frozen entry age actuarial cost method. Pension expense is composed of several
components that are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial cost
method and based on certain actuarial assumptions.



The following table sets forth summarized information on the company’s defined
benefit pension plan:

The fair value of the company’s stock comprised $22 million of the plan’s
assets at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

13.     Statutory Accounting Information

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America differ
in certain respects from statutory insurance accounting practices prescribed or
permitted for insurance companies by regulatory authorities.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted the Codification of
Statutory Accounting Principles (Codification). Codification, which is intended
to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to state insurance
departments, became effective January 1, 2001. However, statutory accounting
principles will continue to be established by individual state laws and
permitted practices. Ohio, the domiciliary state of the company’s insurance
subsidiaries, required adoption of Codification with certain modifications for
the preparation of statutory financial statements effective
January 1, 2001. The following table reconciles consolidated net income for the
years ended December 31, and
shareholders’ equity at December 31, as reported herein in conformity with
GAAP, with total statutory net income and
capital and surplus of the company’s insurance subsidiaries prepared in
accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by
insurance regulatory authorities.

Adopting Codification reduced statutory capital and surplus as of January 1,
2001, by $392 million for the property casualty insurance subsidiaries and $62
million for the life insurance subsidiary.



14.     Transactions with Affiliated Parties

The company paid certain officers and directors, or insurance agencies of which
they are shareholders, commissions of approximately $17 million, $14 million
and $14 million on premium volume of approximately $113 million, $95 million
and $87 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

15.     Contingencies

Various litigation and claims against the company and its subsidiaries are in
process and pending resulting from normal insurance and non-insurance
activities. Based upon a review of open matters with legal counsel, management
believes that the outcomes of normal insurance matters will not have a material
effect upon the company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations and non-insurance matters will be covered by external insurance
coverage.

16.     Stock Options

17.     Segment Information

The company is organized and operates primarily in two industries, property
casualty insurance and life insurance, and has four reportable segments –
commercial lines property casualty insurance, personal lines property casualty
insurance, life insurance and investment operations – which company management
regularly reviews to make decisions about allocating resources to the segments
and assessing their performance. Included in the other category below are the
parent company,
CFC Investment Company and CinFin Capital Management Company operations,
excluding investment activities,
and other income of the insurance subsidiaries.

Revenue is primarily from unaffiliated customers. Insurance segments’ revenues
are insurance premiums earned; investment operations’ revenue represents net
investment income and realized investment gains and losses; and other revenue
is primarily finance/lease income, asset management fees and other income of
the insurance subsidiaries.

Income before income taxes for the insurance segments represents underwriting
profit (loss) – premiums earned minus losses and loss expenses incurred or
policyholder benefits and other expenses. The commercial lines property
casualty segment and the personal lines property casualty segment incurred an
impairment charge amounting to $25 million and $14 million, before tax,
respectively, for capitalized computer software development costs in 2000.
Income before income taxes for the investment operations represents net
investment income, plus realized investment gains and losses, less interest
credited to contract holders. The investment operations segment incurred
other-than-temporary impairment charges related to investments of
$98 million in 2002 and $45 million in 2001. Other losses before income taxes
of $32 million, $35 million and $36 million recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, were primarily due to interest expense from debt of the parent
company and operating expenses of the company’s headquarters.

Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective
segment’s operations. Information regarding identifiable assets is not reported
for two reportable segments – commercial lines and personal lines of property
casualty insurance – because these amounts are not used by company management
for analysis of those segments. All fixed-maturity and equity security
investments, regardless of ownership, are included in the investment operations
segment.



Segment information, is summarized in the following table.

management implemented minor changes as a result of such review, primarily to
formalize and document procedures already in place. The company also
established a disclosure committee that consists of certain members of the
company’s senior management.

The company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
material information relating to the company and its subsidiaries required to
be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Within the 90 days prior to the date of this annual report, the company carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on that evaluation of these disclosure controls and
procedures, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded
that Cincinnati Financial Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of the date of such evaluation.

The chief executive officer and chief financial officer also have concluded
that there were no significant changes in the company’s internal controls or in
other factors that could significantly affect the internal controls subsequent
to the date that the company completed its evaluation.
