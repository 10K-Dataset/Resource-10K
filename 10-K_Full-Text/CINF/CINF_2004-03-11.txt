Part I

Item 1. Business

Introduction

Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CFC or the company) is an Ohio corporation.
Through its subsidiaries, Cincinnati Financial has been conducting insurance
operations since 1950, marketing commercial, personal and life insurance. The
company reports results in four segments:

•

commercial lines property casualty insurance

•

personal lines property casualty insurance

•

life insurance

•

investments

The commercial lines and personal lines property casualty insurance segments
combined to generate more than 83 percent of the company’s revenue in 2003.
Segment information for revenues, income before income taxes, and identifiable
assets is included in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page
72. The company’s segments are defined based on the financial information used
internally to evaluate performance and determine the allocation of resources.

CFC owns 100 percent of its three subsidiaries: The Cincinnati Insurance
Company, CFC Investment Company and CinFin Capital Management Company. The
Cincinnati Insurance Company owns 100 percent of its three subsidiaries: The
Cincinnati Casualty Company, The Cincinnati Indemnity Company and The
Cincinnati Life Insurance Company.

The Cincinnati Insurance Company, founded in 1950, leads the property casualty
group. The Cincinnati Casualty Company and The Cincinnati Indemnity Company
round out the property casualty insurance group, providing flexibility in
pricing and underwriting while ceding substantially all of their business to
The Cincinnati Insurance Company. The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company
primarily markets life insurance and annuities. CFC Investment Company
complements the insurance subsidiaries with leasing and financing services.
CinFin Capital Management Company provides asset management services to
institutions, corporations and high net worth individuals.

CFC’s Headquarters is located in Fairfield, Ohio. At December 31, 2003, the
company had 3,720 associates. The company’s filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission are available, free of charge, on the company’s Web site,

www.cinfin.com

, as soon as possible after they have been filed with the SEC.

Property Casualty Insurance Operations

The company markets its commercial and personal insurance policies in 31 states
through a select group of 963 independent insurance agencies. The company is
committed to the independent agent distribution system, recognizing that
locally based independent agencies have relationships in their communities that
lead to profitable business. Field marketing and other associates provide
service and accountability to the agencies, living in the communities they
serve and working from offices in their homes, providing 24/7 availability. The
company differentiates itself by providing exceptional claims service, through
locally based field claims associates serving the needs of agents and
policyholders, and by offering competitive products, rates and compensation.

Agencies chosen by the company demonstrate the same commitments that
distinguish the company in the marketplace: doing business person to person;
offering broad, value-added services; maintaining sound balance sheets and
managing their agencies professionally. A Best Practices Study by Reagan &
Associates reported that in 2002 just 16 percent of the 39,200 agencies
industrywide generated more than $1.25 million in total revenues compared with
40 percent of the agencies representing the company.

In 2003, agencies representing the company averaged approximately $2.9 million
in agency written premiums for the company. In 2002, the average was
approximately $2.6 million, or 18 percent of agency total volume, up from $2.3
million in 2001. No single agency accounted for more than 1.2 percent of the
company’s total agency written premiums.

In 2003, nine states with at least $100 million in agency earned premium
generated approximately 70 percent of total property casualty premiums. In
these states, agency earned premiums grew 11.1 percent, or $191 million. Ohio,
where the company has 187 independent agencies, accounted for 24.6 percent of
total earned premiums. In the remaining 22 states, agency earned premiums grew
17.8 percent, or $125 million, in 2003.

Over the past several years, the company has created smaller marketing
territories to lower the number of independent agencies for which each local
field marketing representative is responsible. Smaller territories allow
marketing representatives to devote more time to field underwriting and service
as well as to ask for and earn new business. The smaller territories also give
marketing representatives more time to research and appoint new agencies. At
year-end 2003, the company had 87 property casualty field territories, up from
74 at the end of 2000. During 2004, the company plans to split and staff
another five to six territories. The company believes that it can continue to
grow by taking actions intended to maintain or increase its penetration within
its agencies and through the appointment of additional agencies. The company
does not expect to enter any new states in the foreseeable future.

The company’s competitive position reflects:

Insurance companies are rated on their financial strength and claims-paying
ability, providing consumers with comparative information. Among other factors,
independent ratings organizations focus on items such as results of operations,
capital resources and minimum policyholders’ surplus requirements as well as
qualitative analysis. While management believes its financial position will
continue to be strong, the independent rating agencies could change their
criteria or the company’s ratings based on their ongoing reviews.



The company’s current financial strength ratings are summarized as follows:

•

In November 2002, A.M. Best Co. affirmed its top A++ (superior) financial strength
ratings and stable outlook for the company’s property casualty group and subsidiaries.
A.M. Best cited the company’s superior capitalization, sustained profitability and
benefits from its long-standing independent agency strategy. A.M. Best said these
strengths are somewhat offset by the company’s common stock leverage, continued
stockholder dividends and robust reserves with redundancies below historic levels. The
Cincinnati Insurance Companies are one of only 21 insurance groups, out of 1,087 groups
reviewed by the agency and given a rating, to receive an A++ (superior) rating from
Best. Each of the company’s property casualty subsidiaries also is separately rated A++
(superior).

•

In May 2002, Fitch Ratings announced an initial rating of AA (very strong) with a stable
outlook based on the company’s strong financial condition and excellent financial
flexibility. Fitch commented that the property casualty operation is defined by strong
profitability, which is derived in part by above-average premium growth relative to its
peers and strong capitalization at the operating level. The rating also considers the
company’s significant investment concentration in common stocks.

•

In November 2002, Moody’s Investors Service reaffirmed its Aa3 ratings of the property
casualty subsidiaries, noting key factors including the company’s sound balance sheet,
conservative leverage profile and sizable capital base. Moody’s noted that the company’s
pricing and underwriting initiatives should continue to offset large loss severity
trends, which are closely monitored by the company. Other challenges include the risks
inherent in the company’s investment strategy, which is concentrated in a limited number
of equities, and continued development to replace technology systems that lag companies
of comparable size. Following the company’s announcement of year-end 2003 results,
Moody’s noted that the company’s sound capitalization and earnings improvements continue
to support their ratings and stable outlook.

•

In November 2003, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services re-affirmed its AA- (very strong)
ratings and changed its outlook to negative. The AA- rating applies to each insurance
subsidiary based on the company’s strong, competitive business position, high business
persistency, strong capitalization and extremely strong financial flexibility. Standard
& Poor’s noted these factors are countered by the company’s aggressive investment
strategies and relatively slow response to significant market changes. In changing its
outlook, Standard & Poor’s expressed concerns about the slow recovery of the company’s
homeowner business line and the company’s approach to equity investing.

While the potential for volatility exists due to the company’s catastrophe
exposures, investment philosophy and bias towards incremental change, the
ratings agencies consistently have asserted that the company has built
appropriate financial strength and flexibility to manage that volatility and
seek higher long-term returns for shareholders. Management remains committed to
strategies that emphasize long-term stability instead of quickly reacting to
changes in market conditions to obtain short-term benefits.

Consistently high rankings in agent and consumer satisfaction surveys also
demonstrate the company’s market position. Most recently, in a November 2003
survey of the Professional Insurance Agents of Ohio, the company ranked among
the highest in contact time and fairness of claims handling, in approachability
and confidence of company management and in field marketing support. Cincinnati
was named the agents’ top-choice carrier for commercial auto business in a June
2003 survey by

Crittenden’s Property/Casualty Ratings™

, which asked insurance
agents to compare insurers’ accessibility and timely response, premium pricing,
efficiency and fairness of claims payments.

In a 2003 study, Ward Group again named Cincinnati Insurance to its annual
lists of the top 50 property casualty and life/health insurers in America. The
Ward’s 50 names companies that over the past five years have excelled in
balancing performance with policyholder safety. Cincinnati is one of only eight
property casualty insurers that have qualified for the list in each of its 13
years.

Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Reserves

When claims are made by or against policyholders, any amounts that the
company’s property casualty operations pay or expect to pay to the claimant are
termed losses. The costs of investigating, resolving and processing these
claims are termed loss expenses. The consolidated financial statements include
property casualty loss and loss expense reserves that estimate the costs of
paying claims incurred through December 31 of each year. The reserves include
estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have
been incurred but not yet reported, along with estimates of loss expenses
associated with processing and settling those claims. The various estimates are
developed based on individual claim evaluations and statistical projections.
Loss reserves are reduced by the estimated amount of salvage and subrogation.

While the company believes that reported reserves are sufficient for all unpaid
loss and loss expense obligations, the estimation process involves uncertainty
by its very nature. The estimates are continually reviewed, and as facts
regarding individual claims develop and new information becomes known, the
reserve is adjusted as necessary. Adjustments due to loss development for prior
years are reflected in the calendar year in which they are identified. Item 7,
Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Reserves,
Page 18, includes more information about the process used to analyze potential
losses and establish reserves.

The anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating
reserves for loss and loss expenses. While anticipated price increases due to
inflation are considered in estimating the ultimate claim costs, the increase
in average severity of claims is caused by a number of factors that vary with
the individual type of policy written. Average severity is based on historical
trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards, policy
provisions and general economic trends. These trends are monitored based on
actual development. The company does not discount any of its property casualty
loss and loss expense reserves.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the company’s reserve
for losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented
in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 64. The reconciliation
of the December 31, 2002 beginning reserve balance and net incurred losses one
year later recognizes approximately $80 million in redundant reserves. The
redundancy was partially due to the recovery of $38 million Ohio uninsured
motorist/underinsured motorist reserves as discussed in Item 7, Property
Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Reserves, Page 25.

Development of Loss and Loss Expenses



Differences between the property casualty reserves reported in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets (prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America — GAAP) and those same
reserves reported in the annual statements (filed with state insurance
departments in accordance with statutory accounting practices — SAP), relate
principally to the reporting of reinsurance recoverables, which are recognized
as receivables for GAAP and as an offset to reserves for SAP.

The table above shows the development of the estimated reserves for loss and
loss expenses for the years prior to 2003:

•

Section A shows the total property casualty loss and loss expense
reserves recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated
calendar years on a gross and net basis. Those reserves represent the
estimated amount of loss and loss expenses for claims arising in all
prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date, including
losses that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company.

•

Section B shows the cumulative net amount paid with respect to the
previously recorded reserve as of the end of each succeeding year. For
example, as of December 31, 2003, the company had paid $880 million of
loss and loss expenses that have been incurred after 1993; thus an
estimated $135 million of losses incurred as of the end of 1993 remain
unpaid as of year-end 2003.

•

Section C shows the re-estimated amount of the previously reported
reserve based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The
estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes known
about the frequency and severity of claims.

•

Section D, cumulative net redundancy, represents the aggregate change
in the estimates for all years subsequent to the year the reserves
were initially established. For example, reserves established at
December 31, 1993 had developed a $278 million redundancy over 10
years, net of reinsurance, which has been reflected in income over the
10 years. The effects on income in 2003, 2002 and 2001 of changes in
estimates of the reserves for loss and loss expenses for all accident
years are shown in the reconciliation above.

In evaluating this information, it should be noted that each amount includes
the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods. For example, the
amount of deficiency or redundancy related to losses settled in 2003 but
incurred in 1997 will be included in the cumulative deficiency or redundancy
amount for 1998 and each subsequent year. In addition this table presents
calendar year data, not accident or policy year development data, which readers
may be more accustomed to analyzing. Conditions and trends that have affected
development of the reserve in the past may not necessarily occur in the future.
Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or
deficiencies based on this data.

Commercial Lines Property Casualty Insurance Segment

The commercial lines property casualty insurance segment contributed $1.908
billion in net earned premiums to the company’s total revenues and $167 million
of income before income taxes in 2003. The company markets its full complement
of commercial products in all 963 independent agencies and all 31 states in
which it markets property casualty insurance. The company’s emphasis is on
providing products that agents can market to small- to mid-size businesses in
their communities.

Commercial lines net earned premiums grew 10.8 percent in 2003 and 18.6 percent
in 2002. In 2003, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, each with
at least $100 million in agency earned premium, generated 50.8 percent of
commercial lines premiums compared with 51.7 percent in the prior year. In
these states, agency earned premiums grew 12.0 percent, or $108 million, in
2003 compared with 16.1 percent, or $125 million, in 2002. Ohio, where the
company has 187 independent agencies, accounted for 19.4 percent of commercial
lines earned premiums, versus 19.8 percent in 2002. In the remaining 26 states,
agency earned premiums grew 16.3 percent and 9.0 percent, or $137 million and
$133 million, in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Four business lines — commercial multi-peril, workers compensation, commercial
automobile and other liability — account for approximately 90 percent of
commercial lines earned premiums.

•

Commercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage, typically for small- to mid-size businesses.
Property insurance covers damages such as those caused by fire, wind, hail, water, theft, vandalism and business interruption
resulting from a covered loss. Liability coverage insures businesses against third-party liability from accidents occurring on
their premises or arising out of their operations, such as injuries sustained from products sold.

•

Workers compensation covers employers for specified benefits payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries to employees.

•

Commercial auto covers businesses against losses incurred from personal medical payments, uninsured motorists, bodily injury to
third parties, property damage to an insured’s vehicle and property damage to other vehicles and property resulting from the
ownership, maintenance or use of automobiles and trucks in a business.

•

Other liability includes commercial umbrella, commercial general liability and most executive risk policies, which cover liability
exposures including bodily injury, directors and officers and employment practices, property damage arising from products sold and
general business operations.

The remainder of commercial lines earned premiums was derived from a variety of
other types of insurance products the company offers to commercial customers,
including fiduciary and surety bonds and machinery and equipment policies.



Personal Lines Property Casualty Insurance Segment

The personal lines property casualty insurance segment contributed $745 million
in net earned premiums to the company’s total revenues and a $27 million loss
before income taxes in 2003. The company markets its full complement of
personal lines products in 22 of the 31 states in which it markets commercial
lines insurance and selected products within certain agencies in the nine
remaining states.

Personal lines net earned premiums grew 11.2 percent in 2003 and 8.2 percent in
2002. In 2003, Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, each
with $35 million or more in agency earned premium, generated 72.8 percent of
personal lines premiums, compared with 74.1 percent in 2002. In these states,
agency earned premiums grew 8.3 percent, or $42 million, in 2003, versus
7.0 percent, or $33 million, in the prior year. Ohio, where the company has 182
independent agencies writing personal lines products, accounted for 38.2
percent of 2003 personal lines agency earned premiums compared with 39.5
percent in 2002. In the remaining 25 states, agency earned premiums grew 15.9 percent and 12.0 percent, or $28
million and $19 million, in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The company markets homeowners and personal automobile insurance products
through 639 of the 963 independent agencies that represent The Cincinnati
Insurance Companies. The 324 agencies that do not sell these personal lines
products either are located in states in which the company does not actively
market these products or the company has determined, in conjunction with agency
management, that the company’s personal lines products are not appropriate for
their agencies at this time. Personal automobile accounted for 57 percent and
homeowners accounted for 32 percent of personal lines earned premium in 2003.

•

Personal automobile covers liability to others for both bodily injury
and property damage, medical payments to insureds and occupants of
their vehicle, physical damage to an insured’s own vehicle from
collision and various other perils, and uninsured motorists. In
addition, many states require policies to provide first-party personal
injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.

•

Homeowners covers losses to dwellings and contents from a wide variety
of perils, as well as liability arising out of personal activities
both on and off the covered premises. The company also offers coverage
for condominium unit owners and renters.

The remainder of personal lines earned premium was derived from a variety of
other types of insurance products the company offers to individuals such as
dwelling fire, inland marine, umbrella liability and watercraft coverages.

Life Insurance Segment

The life insurance segment contributed $97 million of the company’s total
revenues and a $3 million loss before income taxes in 2003. The life insurance
segment reported a loss because its investment income is included in investment
segment results. See Item 7, Life Insurance, Page 36, for additional information regarding life insurance
segment profitability.

The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company’s mission complements that of the overall
company: to provide products and services that attract and retain high-quality
independent agencies. The company primarily focuses on life products that
produce revenue growth through a steady stream of premiums rather than seeking
to accumulate assets through the sale of single-premium-type policies.

Cincinnati Life seeks to round and protect accounts in the property casualty
agency and to improve account persistency. At the same time, the life operation
looks to increase diversification, revenues and profitability for both the
agency and the company. This strategy enhances the already strong relationship
built by the combination of the property casualty and life
companies.

Cincinnati Life seeks to become the life insurance carrier of choice for the
independent agencies that work with the property casualty operations by
providing competitive products, responsive underwriting, high quality service
and reasonable commissions. At year-end 2003, approximately 86 percent of the
company’s 963 property casualty agencies offered Cincinnati Life’s products to
their policyholders. The life company also seeks to develop life business from
other independent life insurance agencies in a manner that does not conflict
with or compete with the property casualty agencies.

Four lines of business -term insurance, whole life insurance, universal life
insurance and worksite products — account for approximately 85 percent of the
life insurance segment’s revenues:

•

Term insurance — policies under which the benefit is
payable only if the insured dies during a specified
period of time or term; no benefit is payable if the
insured survives to the end of the term. While
premiums are fixed, they must be paid as scheduled.
The proposed insured is evaluated using normal
underwriting standards.

•

Whole life insurance — policies that provide life
insurance for the entire lifetime of the insured; the
death benefit is guaranteed never to decrease and
premiums are guaranteed never to increase. While
premiums are fixed, they must be paid as scheduled.
The proposed insured is evaluated using normal
underwriting standards.

•

Universal life insurance — long-duration life
insurance policies. Contract assessments are neither
fixed nor guaranteed; however, the contract does
specify a minimum interest crediting rate and a
maximum cost of insurance charge and expense charge.
Premiums are not fixed and may be varied by the
contract owner. The proposed insured is evaluated
using normal underwriting standards.

•

Worksite products — term insurance, whole life
insurance and universal life insurance offered to
employees through their employer. Premiums are
collected by the employer using payroll deduction.
Polices are issued using a simplified underwriting
approach and for smaller face amounts than similar
regularly underwritten policies. Term and worksite
insurance products provide the company’s property
casualty agency force with excellent cross serving
opportunities for both commercial and personal
accounts. Agents find



that offering worksite marketing
to employees of their small commercial accounts
provides a benefit to the employees at low cost to the
employer.

In addition, Cincinnati Life markets:

•

Disability income insurance — provides monthly
benefits to offset the insured’s loss of income when
he or she is unable to work due to accident or
illness.

•

Deferred annuities — provides regular income payments
that commence after the end of a specified period or
when the annuitant attains a specified age. During the
deferral period, any payments made under the contract
accumulate at an annually determined crediting rate
declared by the company but not less than a
contract-specified guaranteed minimum rate of interest
of 3 percent to 5 percent. A deferred annuity may be
surrendered during the deferral period for a cash
value equal to the accumulated payments plus interest
less a surrender charge.

•

Immediate annuities — provides some combination of
regular income and lump sum payments in exchange for a
single premium. Most of the immediate annuities
written by the life insurance segment are purchased by
the company’s property casualty companies to settle a
casualty claim.

In 2003, the life insurance segment stopped offering long-term care insurance
to concentrate on its traditional life insurance products.

Cincinnati Life is a financially strong and stable life insurance company.
Cincinnati Life’s statutory adjusted risk-based surplus increased 5.5 percent
to $443 million at December 31, 2003, from $420 million a year earlier.
Liabilities as a percentage of adjusted statutory surplus, a key measure of
life insurance company capital strength, was 39.2 percent at year-end 2003
compared with an estimated industry average of 10.2 percent. A.M. Best — A+
(Superior), Fitch — AA (Very Strong) and Standard & Poor’s -
AA- (Very Strong, negative outlook) maintained their ratings for Cincinnati
Life in 2003.

Investments Segment

Strategy

The investment segment contributed $424 million of the company’s total revenues
in 2003, primarily from net investment income and realized investment gains and
losses from investment portfolios managed for the holding company and each of
the operating subsidiaries. It contributed $381 million of income before income
taxes, or 88.5 percent of total income before income taxes, primarily
investment segment revenues less interest credited to contract holders
(interest assumed in life insurance policy reserve calculations).

While the company seeks to generate an underwriting profit in its property
casualty and life segments, it is the investment segment that historically has
provided the primary source of profits and contributed to the company’s
financial strength, driving long-term growth in shareholders’ equity and book
value.

Under the direction of the investment committee of the board of directors, the
company’s analysts and portfolio managers seek to balance current investment
income opportunities and long-term appreciation so that current cash flows can
be compounded to achieve above-average long-term total return.

While focused on long-term total return, the company maintains liquidity to
meet both its immediate and long-range insurance obligations with the purchase
and maintenance of medium-risk fixed-maturity and equity securities. In recent
years, the company has taken into account the trend toward a flatter corporate
yield curve and an overall decline in credit quality by purchasing
higher-quality corporate bonds with shorter maturities as well as tax-exempt
municipal bonds and U.S. agency paper. The company’s focus on long-term total
return may result in variability in the level of realized and unrealized
investment gains or losses from one period to the next.

Over the long term, unrealized gains in the investment portfolio (accumulated
other comprehensive income) from appreciation and investment of cash flows, has
led to year-end 2003 shareholders’ equity of $2.917 billion at the holding
company level. This gives management flexibility to support the capitalization
policies for the subsidiaries, improving the ability of the insurance companies
to write additional premiums. For the property casualty operations, the
long-term appreciation has contributed to shareholders’ equity of $2.360
billion at year-end 2003 and a ratio of property casualty written premiums to
statutory surplus of 1.0-to-1 compared with an estimated industry average of
1.3-to-1.

In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, convertible securities are
included in Fixed-maturities or Equity Securities, based on the characteristics
of the underlying security (bond or preferred stock). When monitoring and
evaluating investment operations results, the company broadly categorizes
investments as Fixed-income Securities, which includes investment-grade
corporate bonds, high-yield corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal bonds, and
Equity and Equity-linked Securities, which includes common stocks and all
convertible securities.



At year-end 2003 and 2002, these five classes of assets accounted for the

By maintaining a well diversified, fixed-income portfolio, the company attempts
to reduce overall credit risk. With the exception of
U.S. agency paper, no individual fixed-income issuer’s securities account for
more than 2 percent of the fixed-income portfolio.
For the insurance companies’ portfolios, strong emphasis is placed on
purchasing current income-producing securities.

•

Investment-grade corporate bonds have a Moody’s rating at or above Baa 3
or a Standard & Poor’s rating at or above BBB-.
The company seeks to balance current income with potential changes in market
value as well as changes in credit risk when determining whether or not to hold
these securities to maturity.

•

High-yield corporate bonds have a Moody’s rating
below Baa 3 or a Standard & Poor’s rating below BBB-
or are non-rated. The company’s strong capital
position provides the flexibility to invest in these
securities in addition to investment-grade corporate
bonds. While such investments tend to have higher
yields, they are inherently more risky, as their
ratings indicate with a higher potential for default
by the issuer. Historically, they have contributed
positively to investment income and, in general, are
less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Similar
to investment-grade bonds, the company seeks to
balance current income with potential changes in
market value as well as changes in credit risk when
determining whether or not to hold these securities
to maturity. This security class is closely monitored
for selective buying opportunities, but more
importantly for changes in the market that may
negatively impact existing holdings. See Item 7(a),
Potential Impairments, Page 49, for further
discussion.

•

Tax-exempt municipal bonds are exempt from federal
taxes, a feature the company continues to find
attractive. The company invests in a blend of
tax-exempt and taxable fixed-maturity securities,
however, because of alternative minimum tax effects.
The company traditionally has purchased municipal
bonds focusing on essential services, such as
schools, sewer, water or others. While no single
municipal issuer accounts for more than 2 percent of
the tax-exempt municipal bond portfolio,
concentrations within individual states can be high.
Holdings in five states — Indiana, Illinois,
Missouri, Ohio and Texas — account for approximately
67 percent of the municipal bond portfolio.

Equity and Equity-linked Securities

The company’s equity and equity-linked portfolio includes a core group of
common stocks that the company can monitor closely to gain an in-depth
understanding of their organization and industry. It also includes a broader
group of smaller positions in common stocks and convertible securities,
creating trading flexibility and other risk management advantages. The
company’s portfolio of equity investments had an average dividend yield-to-cost
of 9.1 percent at December 31, 2003.

•

Common stocks — Approximately 56 percent of the common stock (measured by
market value) is held at the parent company level. Common stock
investments generally are securities with annual dividend yields of 1.5
percent to 3.0 percent and histories of dividend increases. Other criteria
include increasing sales and earnings, proven management and a favorable
outlook.

When investing in common stock management seeks to identify companies in
which it can accumulate more than 5 percent of their common stock. There also
is a core group of 15 common stocks in which the company holds a market value
of at least $100 million, including five of the six investments where the
company holds more than 5 percent of the common stock. While this emphasis on
a small group of equities and long-term investment horizon has resulted in
significant concentrations within the portfolio, the company has followed
this buy-and-hold strategy for many years, resulting in significant
accumulated unrealized appreciation within the equity portfolio. At year-end
2003, the largest industry concentrations within these large common equity
holdings were the financials sector at 71.7 percent of total market value and
the healthcare sector at 7.8 percent of total market value.

Convertible securities — For more than 30 years, the company has invested
in convertible bonds and convertible preferred stocks. These securities
are the primary trading vehicle in the portfolio. Management believes the
conversion features enhance the overall value of the security and does not
believe that investments in convertible securities pose any significant
risk to the company or its portfolio due to their characteristics. As a
class, convertible securities tend to be less sensitive to interest rate
changes than fixed-rate securities and less sensitive to market conditions
than common stocks.

Additional information regarding the composition of investments is included in
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 62.



Regulations

State Regulation

Insurance Holding Company Regulation

The company’s subsidiaries primarily engage in the property casualty insurance
business, and secondarily in the life insurance business, both subject to
regulation as an insurance holding company system by the State of Ohio, the
domiciliary state of the company and its insurance subsidiaries. Such
regulation requires that each insurance company in the system register with the
department of insurance of its state of domicile and annually furnish financial
and other information about the operations of the individual companies within
the holding company system. All transactions within a holding company affecting
insurers must be fair and equitable. Notice to the insurance commissioner is
required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or
control of an insurer and prior to certain material transactions between an
insurer and any person or entity in its holding company. In addition, some of
those transactions cannot be consummated without the commissioner’s prior
approval.

Subsidiary Dividends

The dividend-paying capacity of the company’s insurance subsidiary is regulated
by the laws of Ohio, the domiciliary state. The insurance subsidiary must
provide a 10-day advance informational notice to the Ohio insurance department
prior to payment of any dividend or distribution to its shareholders. Ordinary
dividends must be paid from earned surplus, which is the amount of unassigned
funds set forth in the insurance subsidiary’s most recent statutory financial
statement.

Prior approval by the Ohio Department of Insurance is required before the
payment of an extraordinary dividend to shareholders. Declaration of any
extraordinary dividend or distribution is conditional, conferring no rights
upon shareholders until 30 days after the superintendent of insurance receives
notice of the declaration and either has not disapproved it or has
affirmatively approved it. Extraordinary dividends or distributions include
cash or other property whose fair market value, together with that of other
dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the
greater of the net income for the preceding calendar year or 10 percent of the
policyholders’ surplus as of the last day of the preceding calendar year. Any
dividend or distribution paid from other than earned surplus also is considered
an extraordinary dividend or extraordinary distribution.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 65, for information
concerning dividends paid by its insurance subsidiary in the year 2003.

Insurance Operations

The company’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to licensing and supervision
by departments of insurance in the states in which they do business. The nature
and extent of such regulations vary, but generally have their source in
statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to
state insurance departments. Such regulations, supervision and administration
of the insurance subsidiaries include, among others, the standards of solvency
which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents;
the nature and limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the
benefit of policyholders; regulation of policy forms and premium rates;
periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other
reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for
other purposes; requirements regarding reserves for unearned premiums, losses
and other matters; the nature of and limitations on dividends to policyholders
and shareholders; the nature and extent of required participation in insurance
guaranty funds; and the involuntary assumption of hard-to-place or high-risk
insurance business, primarily workers compensation insurance.

Loss ratio trends in property casualty insurance operations may be improved by
actions such as changing the amounts or kinds of coverages provided by
policies, providing loss prevention and risk management services, increasing
premium rates, purchasing reinsurance or combining these and other actions. The
ability of the insurance subsidiaries to respond to emerging adverse
underwriting trends may be delayed, from time to time, by the effects of laws
that require prior approval by insurance regulatory authorities of changes in
policy forms and premium rates or that restrict the ability to cancel or
non-renew insurance policies.

Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments

Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which the associations
may assess life and property casualty insurers doing business in the state for
certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and
claimants. Typically, states assess each member insurer in an amount related to
the insurer’s proportionate share of business written by all member insurers in
the state. Assessments to the company’s insurance subsidiaries were $2 million
and $9 million, net of refunds, in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The company
cannot predict the amount and timing of any future assessments on its insurance
subsidiaries under these laws.

Shared Market and Joint Underwriting Plans

State insurance regulation requires insurers to participate in assigned risk
plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations, which are
mechanisms that generally provide applicants with various basic insurance
coverages when they are not available in voluntary markets. Such mechanisms are
most commonly instituted for automobile and workers compensation insurance, but
many states also mandate participation in FAIR Plans or Windstorm Plans, which
provide basic property coverages. Participation is based upon the amount of a
company’s voluntary market share in a particular state for the classes of
insurance involved. Underwriting results related to these organizations, which
tend to be adverse to the company, have been immaterial to the company or its
results of operations.



Statutory Accounting

For public reporting, insurance companies prepare financial statements in
accordance with GAAP. However, certain data also must be calculated according
to statutory accounting rules as defined in the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual.

While not a substitute for any GAAP measure of performance, statutory data
frequently is used by industry analysts and other recognized reporting sources
to facilitate comparisons of the performance of insurance companies. When
appropriate, the company uses statutory data to analyze trends or make
comparisons to industry performance. Estimated industry data is referenced from
materials presented on a statutory basis by A.M. Best, a leading insurance
industry analytical and financial strength rating organization. Statutory data
for the company is labeled as such; all other company data is presented on a
GAAP basis.

The NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles
(Codification) in March 1998. Codification, which standardizes regulatory
accounting and reporting to state insurance regulators, became effective
January 1, 2001. Codification now is incorporated into the NAIC Accounting
Practices and Procedures Manual. The effects of the company’s adoption of
Codification, effective January 1, 2001, are discussed below.

Codification of Statutory Accounting Practices

The effect of adopting Codification is reported as a cumulative-effect type
change in accounting principles for the company’s insurance subsidiaries’
statutory financial statements as of January 1, 2001. This means that the
January 1, 2001, balances of the insurance subsidiaries’ statements of admitted
assets, liabilities, capital and surplus were adjusted to the amounts that
would have been reported had Codification been in effect since the subsidiaries
began operations. Accordingly, there were significant changes to the statutory
surplus on January 1, 2001. For the property casualty companies, a net decrease
in surplus of $392 million resulted from: deferred tax assets of $314 million,
consisting primarily of taxes on the timing of loss reserves and unearned
premiums; deferred tax liabilities of $701 million, comprised mainly of taxes
on net unrealized gains; guaranty fund assessments and premium tax liabilities
of $11 million; and earned-but-unbilled premium receivables of $6 million. For
the life company, deferred tax liabilities of $62 million, comprised mainly of
taxes on net unrealized gains, resulted in a corresponding decrease in surplus
on January 1, 2001.

Additionally, prior to 2001, the company’s property casualty insurance
subsidiaries recognized written premiums as they were billed throughout the
policy period, which was a previously acceptable method. Beginning on January
1, 2001, the subsidiaries began recognizing written premiums on an annualized
basis at the effective date of the policy as required by Codification. This
method of recognizing written premiums had no effect on earned premiums. To
account for unbooked premiums related to policies with effective dates prior to
January 1, 2001, the company recorded a written premium adjustment on January
1, 2001, of $402 million that appeared in the 2001 statutory financial reports
submitted to insurance regulatory authorities. Since this adjustment affected
written premiums only and was one-time in nature, it has been excluded from
comparisons of statutory written premiums between 2003, 2002 and 2001 in this
report. Written premiums for 2000 presented in this report have been
reclassified to conform with the 2001 presentation based on policy contract
periods; information was not readily available to reclassify earlier years’
statutory data.

Insurance Reserves

State insurance laws require that insurance subsidiaries analyze the adequacy
of reserves annually. The company’s outside actuaries must submit an opinion
that reserves are adequate for policy claims-paying obligations and related
expenses.

Risk-Based Capital Requirements

The NAIC’s risk-based capital (RBC) requirements for property casualty and life
insurers serve as an early warning tool for the NAIC and the state regulators
to identify companies that may be undercapitalized and may merit further
regulatory action. The ratio of a company’s actual policyholders’ surplus to
its minimum capital requirement determines whether any state regulatory action
is required. At December 31, 2003, the company’s lead insurance subsidiary and
each of its subsidiaries had more than sufficient capital to meet the RBC
minimum requirements and had excess capacity beyond these requirements to write
additional premiums.

Federal Regulation

Although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not
directly regulate the business of insurance, federal initiatives often have an
impact. Some of the current and proposed federal measures that may
significantly affect the company’s business are discussed below.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA), signed into law on November
26, 2002, provides a temporary federal backstop for losses related to the
writing of the terrorism peril in property casualty insurance policies. TRIA
currently is scheduled to expire December 31, 2005. Under regulations
promulgated under this statute, insurers are required to offer terrorism
coverage for certain lines of property casualty insurance, including property,
commercial multi-peril, fire, ocean marine, inland marine, liability,
commercial auto, aircraft, surety and workers compensation. In the event of a
terrorism event defined by TRIA, the federal government will reimburse
terrorism claim payments subject to the insurer’s deductible. The deductible is
calculated as a percentage of premiums written for the preceding calendar year.
For 2003, the company’s deductible was $136 million. For 2004, the company’s
deductible will be $199 million (10 percent of 2003 subject premiums); and for
2005, the deductible will be 15 percent of 2004 subject premiums.

The company’s life insurance subsidiary protects consumer health information
pursuant to regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Regulations effective April 14, 2003,
require health care providers such as doctors and hospitals, as well as health
and long-term care insurers and health care clearinghouses, to institute
physical and procedural safeguards to protect the health records of patients
and insureds. Examples of mandated safeguards include requirements to send
notices of the entity’s privacy practices to patients and insureds and to give
patients and insureds the right to access and



request amendments to their
records. The insured’s authorization is required before a provider, insurer or
clearinghouse can use health information for marketing and certain other
purposes. Effective October 16, 2003, additional regulations require health
plans to electronically transmit and receive standardized healthcare
information. These rules and regulations minimally impact the company as its
health insurance writings are limited to its self-funded health plan for
company associates and a small number of run-off medical and hospital expense
insurance policies. The company does not actively market medical and hospital
expense insurance policies.

Item 2. Properties

Cincinnati Financial Corporation owns its headquarters building located on 75
acres of land in Fairfield, Ohio. This building contains approximately 615,000
square feet, of which approximately 5 percent is available for future CFC

million as of December 31, 2003, and is classified as Other invested assets.

The company’s headquarters property is adequate and suitable for its business
needs for at least the next two years. The company will determine the timeline
for developing additional space at its headquarters location in 2004.

permitting only the individual claims of named plaintiffs to proceed. The
company denies the allegations of the suit and is vigorously defending this
action.

The company is involved in no other material litigation other than routine
litigation incident to the nature of its insurance business.

company’s equity compensation plans is available in Note 8 and Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, Pages 65 and 71.



Item 6. Selected Financial Data

One-time charges or adjustments:

In 2003, as the result of a settlement negotiated with a vendor, pretax results
included the recovery of $23 million of the $39 million one-time, pretax charge
incurred in 2000.

In 2000, the company recorded a one-time charge of $39 million, pre-tax, to
write down previously capitalized costs related to the development of software
to process property casualty policies.

In 2000, the company earned $5 million in interest in the first quarter from a
$303 million single-premium bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policy booked at
the end of 1999 that was segregated as a Separate Account effective April 1,
2000. Investment income and realized investment gains and losses from separate
accounts generally accrue directly to the contract holder and, therefore, are
not included in the company’s consolidated financials.

In 1993, results included a credit related to the method of accounting for
income taxes to conform with Statement of Accounting Financial Standards No.
109 and a charge related to the effect of 1993 increases in income tax rates on
deferred taxes recorded for various prior-year items.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction

The following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the
consolidated results of operations and financial position of Cincinnati
Financial Corporation (CFC). It should be read in conjunction with Item 6,
Selected Financial Data, Pages 14 and 15 and Item 8, Consolidated Financial
Statements and related Notes, beginning on Page 58.

Among the various factors that influence the consolidated results of operations
and financial position of the company, management considers its relationships
with independent agencies to be the most significant. To continue to achieve
its performance targets, the company must maintain its strong relationships
with the select group of agencies with which it does business, write a
significant portion of each agency’s business and attract new agencies. The
company seeks to be an indispensable partner in each agency’s success. The
company measures its accomplishment of this objective based on being the
largest or second largest carrier in each agency, either by dollars of premium
or number of policies written, depending on the agency’s mix of business.

As described in the safe harbor statement below, some factors could affect
relationships with its independent agencies and limit opportunities for growth.
Management is responsible for monitoring and managing those risk factors. In
Item 1, Business, Page 1, and the Results of Operations, Page 22, management
covers factors that it believes ensure it can sustain its relationships with
independent agencies. In addition, the Management’s Discussion and Analysis
reviews other important factors relating to the outlook, including its
investing and reserving philosophy.

Safe Harbor Statement

The following discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that
involve potential risks and uncertainties. The company’s future results could
differ materially from those discussed. Factors that could cause or contribute
to such differences include, but are not limited to:

•

recession or other economic conditions resulting in lower demand for insurance products

•

unusually high levels of catastrophe losses due to changes in weather patterns, environmental events or other causes

•

increased frequency and/or severity of claims

•

events or conditions that could weaken or harm the company’s relationships with its independent agencies and limit opportunities for growth, including a downgrade of the company’s
financial strength ratings, concerns that doing business with the company is too difficult or perceptions that the company’s level of service is no longer a distinguishing
characteristic in the marketplace

•

delays in the development, implementation and benefits of technology enhancements

•

amount of reinsurance purchased and financial strength of reinsurers

•

inaccurate estimates or assumptions used for critical accounting estimates

•

sustained decline in overall stock market values negatively affecting the company’s equity portfolio, in particular a sustained decline in market value of Fifth Third Bancorp shares

•

events that lead to a significant decline in the market value of a particular security and impairment of the asset

•

decreased ability to generate growth in investment income

•

insurance regulatory actions, legislation or court decisions that increase expenses or place the company at a disadvantage in the marketplace

•

adverse outcomes from litigation or administrative proceedings

Further, the company’s insurance businesses are subject to the effects of
changing social, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory
initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium
rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards
and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and
regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock,
such as recent measures impacting corporate financial reporting and governance.
The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are
uncertain.

Readers are cautioned that the company undertakes no obligation to review or
update the forward-looking statements included in this material.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Cincinnati Financial Corporation’s financial statements are prepared using
GAAP. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and
accompanying Notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial
statements are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
Page 58. In conjunction with that discussion, material implications of
uncertainties associated with the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying
the company’s critical accounting policies are discussed below. The audit
committee of the board of directors reviews the annual financial statements
with management and the independent auditor. These discussions cover the
quality of earnings, review of reserves and accruals, reconsideration of the
suitability of accounting principles, review of highly judgmental areas
including critical accounting policies, audit adjustments and such other
inquiries as may be appropriate.

Property Casualty Insurance Loss Reserves

The most significant estimates relate to the company’s reserves for property
casualty loss and loss expenses. Insurance loss reserves are affected directly
by management’s reserving philosophy. Management bases the estimates on company
experience and information from internal analysis, and obtains additional
information from consulting outside actuaries.

Reserve estimates are established for the total of unpaid loss and loss
expenses, including estimates for claims that have been reported, estimates for
claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and estimates of loss
expenses associated with processing and settling those claims. Reserves are
allocated to various lines of business. For reported claims, management
establishes case reserves within the parameters of coverage provided in the
policy. For claims incurred but not yet reported, management uses a variety of
tools, including actuarial and statistical analysis, to estimate reserves. Loss
reserves are reduced by the estimated amount of salvage and subrogation.

At year-end 2003, the total reserve balance, net of reinsurance, was $2.845
billion compared with $2.608 billion at year-end 2002 and $2.352 billion at
year-end 2001. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 64,
for a reconciliation of property casualty reserve balances with the loss and
loss expenses liability on the balance sheet. The increase in reserves in each
year reflected the increases in policies and coverage in force, loss
development reflecting the trend toward larger average losses and management’s
conclusions regarding adequate reserve levels. Management believes that the
stability of the company’s business makes its historic data the most important
source for establishing adequate reserve levels. Traditionally, management and
the outside actuaries have conducted a thorough evaluation in the calendar
fourth quarter of the adequacy of reserves as of the end of the third quarter
of each year. As a result, the most significant variation in reserves
traditionally has been implemented in the fourth quarter. In the quarters
following, less detailed but continuous reviews of reserve adequacy are made
and any resulting adjustments are reflected in that quarter’s results. In 2004
and beyond, management plans to conduct more extensive analysis of reserve
adequacy each quarter.

While the company believes that reported reserves make a reasonable provision
for all unpaid loss and loss expense obligations, the estimation process
involves a number of variables and assumptions. Management believes this
uncertainty is mitigated by the historic stability of the company’s book of
business and by its continuous review of estimates. As experience develops and
new information becomes known, the reserve is adjusted as appropriate. In this
process, the company monitors trends in the industry, relevant court cases,
legislative activity and other current events in an
effort to ascertain new or additional exposures to loss. If management
determines that reserves established in prior years were not sufficient or were
excessive, the change is reflected in current year results.

The company’s outside actuary provides management with an opinion regarding the
acceptable range for adequate statutory reserves based on generally accepted
actuarial guidelines. Historically, the company has established adequate
reserves in the upper half of the actuary’s range. This approach has resulted
in recognition of reserve redundancies in each of the past 10 years, which
moderated beginning in 2000. Modestly redundant reserves support the company’s
business strategy to retain high financial strength ratings and remain a market
for agencies’ business in all market conditions.

The outside actuary’s range for adequate statutory reserves, net of
reinsurance, was $2.696 billion to $2.906 billion for 2003; $2.492 billion to
$2.674 billion for 2002; and $2.267 billion to $2.429 billion for 2001. The
assumptions used to establish the recommended ranges were consistent with prior
year practices as described above and in Item 1, Property Casualty Loss and
Loss Expense Reserves, Page 3.

Slowness to recognize or respond to new or unexpected loss patterns, such as
those caused by the risk factors cited in the company’s safe harbor statement,
could lead to a rise in reserves, which would lead to a higher loss and loss
expense ratio; each percentage point increase in the loss and loss expenses
ratio would reduce pre-tax income by $27 million based on 2003 earned premiums.



Highly Uncertain Exposures

In the normal course of its business, the company may provide coverage for
exposures for which estimates of losses are highly uncertain. Most significant
are catastrophic events. Due to the nature of these events, management is
unable to predict precisely the frequency or potential cost of catastrophe
occurrences. However, in an effort to control such losses, the company does not
market property casualty insurance in California, reviews aggregate exposures
to huge disasters and monitors its exposure in certain coastal regions.
Analysis of a once-in-250-year event affirms the company has catastrophe
exposure to:

•

hurricanes in the gulf and southeastern coastal regions

•

earthquakes in the New Madrid fault zone, which lies within the central Mississippi valley, extending from northeast
Arkansas through southeast Missouri, western Tennessee and western Kentucky to southern Illinois

•

tornado, wind and hail in the Midwest, Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions

The company uses the Risk Management Solutions and Applied Insurance Research
models to evaluate exposures and aid in determining appropriate reinsurance
coverage programs. Reinsurance mitigates the risk of these highly uncertain
exposures and limits the maximum net loss that can arise from large risks or
risks concentrated in areas of exposure. In conjunction with these activities,
the company also continues to explore and analyze credible scientific evidence,
including the impact of global climate change, that may affect its exposure
under insurance policies. Management’s decisions regarding the appropriate
level of property casualty risk retention are affected by various factors,
including changes in the company’s underwriting practices, capacity to retain
risks and reinsurance market conditions. See Reinsurance, Page 26, for a
discussion of the company’s 2004 reinsurance treaties.

Asset Impairment

Fixed-income and equity investments are the company’s largest assets. Certain
estimates and assumptions made by management relative to investment portfolio
assets are critical. The company’s asset impairment committee continually
monitors investments and all other assets for signs of other-than-temporary
and/or permanent impairment. Among other signs, the committee monitors
significant decreases in the market value of the assets, changes in legal
factors or in the business climate, an accumulation of costs in excess of the
amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset, uncollectability
of all other assets, or other factors such as bankruptcy, deterioration of
creditworthiness, failure to pay interest or dividends or signs indicating that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

The application of the company’s impairment policy resulted in
other-than-temporary impairment charges and write-offs of investments that
reduced the company’s income before income taxes by $80 million, $98 million
and $45 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Other-than-temporary impairment in the value of securities is defined by the
company as declines in valuation that meet specific criteria established in the
asset impairment policy. Such declines often occur in conjunction with events
taking place in the overall economy and market, combined with events specific
to the industry or operations of the issuing corporation. These specific
criteria include a declining trend in market value, the extent of the market
value decline and the length of time the value of the security has been
depressed, as well as subjective measures such as pending events and issuer
liquidity. Generally, these declines in valuation are greater than might be
anticipated when viewed in the context of overall economic and market
conditions. See Investment Portfolio, Page 44, for information regarding
valuation of the invested assets.

Impairment charges are recorded for other-than-temporary declines in value, if,
in the asset impairment committee’s judgment, there is little expectation that
the value will be recouped in the foreseeable future. The impairment policy
defines a security as distressed when it is trading below 70 percent of book
value or has a Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s credit rating below B3/B-.
Distressed securities are monitored as potentially impaired. The security may
be written down in the event of a declining market value for four consecutive
quarters with quarter-end market value below 50 percent of book value, or when
a security’s market value is 50 percent below book value for three consecutive
quarters. A sudden and severe drop in market value that does not otherwise meet
the above criteria is reviewed for possible immediate impairment. Not
withstanding the above, the company’s portfolio managers constantly monitor the
status of their assigned portfolios for indications of potential problems or
issues that may be possible impairment issues. If a significant impairment
indicator is noted, the portfolio managers even more closely scrutinize the
security.

When evaluating other-than-temporary impairments, the committee considers the
company’s ability to retain a security for a period adequate to recover a
significant percentage of cost. Because of the company’s investment philosophy
and strong capitalization, it can hold securities that have the potential to
recover value until their scheduled redemption, when they might otherwise be
deemed impaired. Investment assets that have already been impaired are
evaluated based on their adjusted book value and further written down, if
deemed appropriate. The decision to sell or write down an asset with impairment
indications reflects, at least in part, management’s opinion that the security
no longer meets the company’s investment expectations. See Item 7(a),
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Page 47, for
detailed information regarding securities trading in a continuous loss position
at December 31, 2003. Other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of
investments are recognized in net income as realized losses at the time when
facts and circumstances indicate such write-downs are warranted.

Permanent impairment charges (write-offs) are defined as those for which
management believes there is little potential for future recovery, for example,
following the bankruptcy of the issuing corporation. These permanent declines
in the fair value of investments are written off at the time when facts and
circumstances indicate such write-downs are warranted, and they are reflected
in realized losses.



Other-than-temporary and permanent impairments are distinct from the ordinary
fluctuations seen in the value of a security when considered in the context of
overall economic and market conditions. Securities considered to have a
temporary decline would be expected to recover their market value or are
fixed-income securities that the company intends to hold until maturity. Under
the same accounting treatment as market value gains, temporary declines
(changes in the fair value of these securities) are reflected on the company’s
balance sheet in other comprehensive income, net of tax, and have no impact on
reported net income.

Life Insurance Policy Reserves

Reserves for traditional life insurance policies are based on expected
expenses, mortality, withdrawal rates and investment yields, including a
provision for adverse deviation. Once these assumptions are established, they
generally are maintained throughout the lives of the contracts. Expected
mortality is derived primarily from industry experience. Withdrawal rates are
based on company and industry experience, while investment yield is based on
company experience and the economic conditions then in effect.

Reserves for the company’s universal life, deferred annuity and investment
contracts are equal to the cumulative account balances, which include premium
deposits plus credited interest less charges and withdrawals.

Employee Benefit Plan

The company has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all
employees. Contributions and pension costs are developed from annual actuarial
valuations. These valuations involve key assumptions including discount rates
and expected return on plan assets, which are updated each year. Any
adjustments to these assumptions are based on considerations of current market
conditions. Therefore, changes in the related pension costs or credits may
occur in the future due to changes in assumptions.

The key assumptions used in developing the 2003 net pension expense were a 6.5
percent discount rate, an 8.0 percent expected return on plan assets and rates
of compensation increases ranging from 5 percent to 7 percent, depending on the
age of the employee. The 8 percent return on assets assumption is based on the
fact that substantially all of the investments held by the pension plan are
common stocks that pay annual dividends. Management believes this rate is
representative of the expected long-term rate of return on these assets. These
assumptions were consistent with the prior year except that the discount rate
was reduced by one half of one percent due to current market conditions.
Compared with the prior year, the net pension expense was increased by $4
million. For 2004, the company expects a net pension expense of $8 million,
primarily as a result of lower plan assets, lower expected returns and one half
of one percent reduction in the interest rate used in converting the lump-sum
cash-out form of payment at retirement.

Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half of one percent increase or
decrease in the discount rate would have increased or decreased the company’s
2003 net income before income taxes by $1 million. Likewise, a one half of one
percent increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have
increased or decreased 2003 income before income taxes by $1 million.

In addition, the fair value of the plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit
obligation by $21 million at December 31, 2003, and by $31 million at December
31, 2002. The fair value of the plan assets was less than the projected plan
benefit obligation by $29 million at December 31, 2003, and by $9 million at
December 31, 2002. Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect
future assets and liabilities of the pension plan. An additional liability may
be required in the future, with the potential for a charge to equity to the
extent the minimum liability exceeds unrecognized prior service cost upon
measurement of plan obligations, which is usually completed by the company at
the end of each year.

Deferred Acquisition Costs

The company establishes a deferred asset for costs that vary with and are
primarily related to acquiring property casualty and life business. These costs
are principally agent commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting
costs, which are deferred and amortized into income as premiums are earned.
Deferred acquisition costs have grown in line with the growth in premiums.
Underlying assumptions are updated periodically to reflect actual experience.
Changes in the amounts of timing or estimated future profits could result in
adjustments to the accumulated amortization of these costs.

For property casualty policies, deferred costs are amortized over the terms of
the policies. For life policies, acquisition costs are deferred and amortized
over the premium-paying period of the policies.

Separate Accounts

The company issues life contracts with guaranteed minimum returns, referred to
as bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLI), the assets and liabilities of
which are legally segregated and recorded as assets and liabilities of the
separate accounts. Minimum investment returns and account values are guaranteed
by the company and also include death benefits to beneficiaries of the contract
holders.

The assets of the separate accounts are carried at fair value. Separate account
liabilities primarily represent the contract holders’ claims to the related
assets and are carried at the fair value of the assets. Generally, investment
income and realized investment gains and losses of the separate accounts accrue
directly to the contract holders and, therefore, are not included in the
company’s Consolidated Statements of Income, however, each separate account
contract includes a negotiated realized gain and loss sharing arrangement with
the company. This share is transferred from the separate account to the
company’s general account and is recognized as revenue or expense. In the event
that the asset value of contract holders’ accounts is projected below the value
guaranteed by the company, a liability is established through a charge to the
company’s earnings.



In the company’s most significant separate account written in 1999, realized
gains and losses are retained in the separate account and are deferred and
amortized to the contract holder over a five-year period, subject to certain
limitations. Upon termination or maturity of this separate account contract,
any unamortized deferred gains and/or losses will revert to the general
account. In the event this separate account holder were to surrender the
contract, there would be a surrender charge equal to 10 percent of the
contract’s account value during the first five years. Beginning in year 6, the
surrender charge decreases 2 percent a year to 0 percent in year 11. At
December 31, 2003, net unamortized losses amounted to $2 million. In accordance
with this separate account agreement, the investment assets must meet certain
criteria established by the regulatory authorities to whose jurisdiction the
group contract holder is subject. Therefore, sales of investments may be
mandated to maintain compliance with these regulations, possibly requiring
gains or losses to be recorded, and charged to the general account.
Potentially, losses could be material; however, unrealized losses at December
31, 2003, in the separate account portfolio were less than $1 million.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 61, for information
regarding recent accounting pronouncements. Management has determined that
recent accounting pronouncements have not had nor are they expected to have any
material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

The consolidated results of operations reflect the operating results of each of
the company’s four segments along with parent company and other non-insurance
related activities. The four segments are:

•

commercial lines property casualty insurance

•

personal lines property casualty insurance

•

life insurance

•

investments

Highlights of the consolidated results for the past three years include:

Revenues – Revenue growth accelerated over the three-year period on strong
property casualty performance. Earned premium growth slowed in 2003 as
commercial pricing increases continued, but at a lower rate. In addition,
realized investment losses were substantially lower in 2003 than 2002 and
investment income continued to rise. The company’s emphasis on common stock
holdings with an increasing flow of dividend payments has led to continued
growth of investment income even though low prevailing interest rates have
limited opportunities to expand income from fixed-income investments.

Net income – Net income rose 57.0 percent in 2003 and 23.3 percent in 2002. In
each of the past three years, the company’s total benefits and expenses have
grown less rapidly than revenues, as management’s strategies to improve
profitability have taken effect. Strong property casualty underwriting profit
in 2003 led to a higher effective tax rate.

Realized investment gains and losses – A significant factor in the growth rate
for net income in any year can be realized investment gains and losses.
Management believes it is important to carefully consider the impact of
realized investment gains and losses on net income when evaluating the
company’s primary business areas: property casualty insurance and life
insurance. Management believes the level of realized investment gains and
losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may obscure the
performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period. While
realized investment gains and losses are integral to the company’s insurance
operations over the long term, the determination to recognize gains or losses
in any period may be subject to management’s discretion and is independent of
the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, under applicable accounting
requirements, gains and losses can be recognized from certain changes in market
values of securities without actual realization.

In the three-year period, the after tax impact of realized investment losses
was to reduce net income by $27 million, or 17 cents per share, in 2003, by $62
million, or 38 cents, in 2002 and by $17 million, or 10 cents, in 2001. Net
realized investment losses were lower in 2003 than 2002 as other-than-temporary
impairment charges declined due to the economic and market recovery and as net
gains on the sale of securities rose to a higher level. See Investments Results
of Operations, Page 38, for additional information on net realized investment
gains and losses.

Other considerations – In addition, two items in 2003 that the company
considered to be unusual should be taken into consideration when evaluating
ongoing business operations:

•

Software recovery – In the third quarter of 2003, the company recovered
$23 million pretax in a settlement negotiated with a vendor. The recovery
added $15 million, or 9 cents per share, to after tax net income. The
negotiated settlement related to the
$39 million one-time, pretax charge incurred in the third quarter of 2000 to write off previously capitalized software development costs.

•

Uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist reserve release – In the
fourth quarter of 2003, the company released $38 million pretax of
previously established UM/UIM reserves following the Ohio Supreme
Court’s decision to limit its 1999

Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mutual

decision. That action added $25 million, or 15 cents per share to
after tax net income. See Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense
Reserves, Page 25, for additional information regarding UM/UIM
reserves.



Option expense – In each of the past three years, net income would have been
reduced by approximately 6 cents if option expense, calculated using the
binomial option-pricing model, was included in operating expenses.

Book value – Book value reached a record high of $38.69 at year-end 2003
because of the recovery in the financial markets that led to higher market
values for equity investments. Year-end 2002 and 2001 book value declined
primarily because of fluctuations in market values for the equity investment
portfolio.

Comprehensive income – Accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes
the accumulated unrealized gains on investments and derivatives, grew by $441
million in 2003 after declining $470 million and $43 million in 2002 and 2001.
See Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 7, for additional information on the
investment portfolio and see Shareholders’ Equity, Page 46, for information on
unrealized gains and losses. Return on equity improved for the third
consecutive year while return on equity based on comprehensive income rose to
13.8 percent from a negative 4.0 percent in 2002 and 2.5 percent in 2001.

Outlook

Based on its outlook for the insurance and investment markets, its progress in
implementing operating strategies and its results for 2003, management has
established certain performance targets for 2004 including:

•

Property casualty written and earned premium growth in the high single digits.

•

Combined ratio for the property casualty operations in the range of 95 percent compared with 94.7 percent in 2003, which
included a benefit of 0.8 percentage points from the software recovery and 1.4 percentage points from the UM/UIM reserve
release. The 2004 target does not include benefits anticipated from additional UM/UIM reserve releases and assumes the
combined ratio will include approximately 3.0 to 3.5 percentage points for catastrophe losses.

•

Investment income growth of 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent compared with 4.7 percent in 2003.

Factors supporting management’s outlook for 2004 and beyond are discussed in
the results of operations for each of the four business segments.

Segment Results of Operations

As described in Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 72,
management measures segment profit or loss for its property casualty and life
businesses based upon underwriting results. Insurance underwriting results
(profit or loss) represent net earned premium less loss and loss expenses and
underwriting expenses on a pretax basis. Management also measures aspects of
the performance of its commercial lines and personal lines segments on a
combined property casualty insurance operations basis. For the combined
property casualty insurance operations as well as the commercial lines and
personal lines segment, statutory accounting data and ratios are key
performance indicators that are used for comparison to industry results since
GAAP-based industry data is not readily available. Statutory accounting data
and ratios also are key performance indicators for The Cincinnati Life
Insurance Company, the life insurance subsidiary.

The related investment portfolios for the property casualty and life insurance
segments are managed separately from the underwriting businesses, along with
investments held by the parent company. Net investment income and net realized
investment gains and losses are discussed in the investments segment
discussion. Underwriting results and segment pretax operating income are not a
substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP.

The following sections review results of operations for the combined property
casualty insurance operations and, separately, for each of the company’s four
reportable segments (see Commercial Lines Results of Operations, Page 27,
Personal Lines Results of Operations, Page 32, Life Insurance Results of
Operations, Page 36, and Investments Results of Operations, Page 38).

Within the property casualty insurance market, the company offers both
commercial and personal policies through a network of independent agencies.
Highlights of the performance for the combined property casualty insurance
operations included:

•

Earned premiums – Over the past three years, the company has taken
advantage of strong insurance industry pricing and leveraged its
relationships with independent agencies to obtain higher premiums on new
and renewal business. The rate of increase for commercial lines earned
premiums slowed in 2003, reflecting changing market conditions, while the
rate of increase for personal lines earned premium rose due to higher
rates. Total policy count was down 2.2 percent in 2003 after rising
1.7 percent in 2002.

Management considers statutory net written premium growth to be a key
performance indicator, since it can be used to compare the company’s growth
to industry performance and allows it to evaluate the success of its
strategies. The estimated industry growth rate was 10.2 percent, 14.9 percent
and 8.5 percent in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The company’s statutory
net written premiums on an adjusted basis rose 11.7 percent in 2003, 14.0
percent in 2002 and 13.0 percent in 2001. The company’s 2003 and 2002
statutory net written premiums were adjusted for the effect of a refinement
adopted in 2002 of the company’s estimation process for matching written
premiums to policy effective dates. The company’s 2001 statutory net written
premiums were adjusted for the adoption of Codification.

•

Underwriting results and combined ratio – For the third consecutive year,
combined property casualty underwriting performance improved on a
year-over-year basis as the result of growth in premiums, in particular
more adequate premium per policy, and as a result of benefits from
underwriting efforts. The statutory industry averages are estimated 101.1
percent, 107.4 percent and
115.9 percent for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. On a statutory adjusted
basis, the 2003 property casualty combined ratio of 95.0 percent before the
software recovery, included a 1.4 percentage-point benefit from the UM/UIM
reserve release, and compared with 99.6 percent and 103.6 percent in 2002 and
2001. The company’s 2002 ratio reflects the written premium adjustment and
the 2001 ratio reflects the adoption of Codification. The favorable
comparison of this key performance indicator to industry trends highlights
the success of the company’s strategies.

The company achieved strong growth by leveraging the competitive
characteristics discussed in Item 1, Property Casualty Insurance Operations,
Page 1. It continues to apply its relationship-based strategies, including a
case-by-case approach to new business and account renewals. While insisting on
adequate premiums for covered exposures, the company continues to do business
the way it always has; on the local level, focusing on each relationship
separately. Commercial lines pricing remained flexible to respond to each risk
in cooperation with local agencies, which are in a position to know their
market and their business. The company believes that this approach results in
more high-quality accounts over the long term, further solidifies its
relationships with independent agencies and establishes a basis for continued
growth.

The company has been more aggressively identifying and measuring exposures to
match coverage amounts and premiums to the risk. Where this matching is not
possible, accounts are not being renewed unless there are mitigating factors.
Agents agree on the need to carefully select risks and assure pricing adequacy.
They appreciate the time the company’s associates invest in creating solutions
for their clients while protecting profitability, whether that means working on
an individual case or developing modified policy terms and conditions that
preserve flexibility, choice and other sales advantages.



Growth also has reflected the efforts to improve customer service through the
creation of smaller marketing territories, permitting local field marketing
representatives to devote more time to each independent agency. At year-end
2003, the company had 87 property casualty field territories, up from 76 at the
end of 2001. During 2004, the company plans to split and staff another five to
six territories. Smaller territories allow marketing representatives to
increase the level of service as well as expand the opportunities to ask for
and earn new business. The average net earned premium per territory rose 7.8
percent in 2003 to $32 million following a 5.0 percent increase in 2002.

The company’s success has been built on frontline decision-making. The company
expects to continue to strengthen its relationships with agencies with
technology that brings agencies greater efficiencies while permitting
associates to spend more time with people and less with paper. CinciLink, the
company’s Web site for agencies, enables agencies to obtain information and
access the
company’s new Web-based systems. The Web site includes content to make it
easier for agencies to place business with the company, such as online policy
loss information, software updates and a property casualty electronic coverage
forms library. The initial rollout of commercial lines and personal lines
rating software was achieved through CinciLink.

In 2003, WinCPP, an online system for commercial lines processing, was expanded
to 10 states and now is available for agencies writing more than 70 percent of
the company’s total premiums. CMS, a new claims file management system, was
deployed in late 2003 to field claims associates in all states. CMS supports
the company’s continued comitment to providing exemplary claims service with a
personal touch by lifting the administrative burden from the field claims
representatives. Through December 31, 2003, capitalized development costs
related to CMS totaled $14 million. In 2004, management anticipates investing
another $10 million to enhance CMS, providing capabilities for agencies and
more comprehensive financial reporting.

The discussion of the commercial lines and personal lines segments provides
additional detail regarding these strategies and trends.

Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Reserves

The largest component of the property casualty segments’ expenses is loss and
loss expenses incurred, which includes both paid losses and net reserve
additions for unpaid losses as well as expenses related to each. Paid losses
and related loss expense accounted for 86.9 percent, 85.3 percent and 89.3
percent of property casualty insurance losses and policyholder benefits
incurred in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The remaining 13.1 percent, 14.7 percent and 10.7 percent in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively, reflected additions to reserves for all unpaid loss and
loss expense obligations, including case reserves for reported losses and
reserves for incurred but not yet reported losses, offset by released reserves.
The reserve estimation policies for the property casualty segments are
described in Property Casualty Insurance Loss Reserves, Page 18. The majority
of IBNR increases over the past three years have been due to growth in premiums
and loss cost inflation as well as management’s continuous efforts to achieve
its best estimates of ultimate incurred losses. The assessment is made for each
business line within the commercial lines and personal lines segments.

Reserve levels in 2003 also reflected management’s assessment that mold-related
reserves should be strengthened and the need to establish higher loss expense
reserves because of the rise in litigation costs due to larger and more complex
claims. These two 2003 increases were offset by the release of $38 million in
UM/UIM reserves following the November 2003 Ohio Supreme Court’s limiting of
its 1999

Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mutual

decision. As the company reviews
pending claims in light of the recent court decision, up to an additional $37
million in UM/UIM case reserves may be released in coming quarters.

In the November 2003 decision to limit the Scott-Pontzer decision, the court
ruled that an employer’s commercial automobile insurance policy only covers
injured employees and only when the accident happens in the course and scope of
their employment. Since 1999, the company had established case reserves and
IBNR for past UM/UIM losses incurred but not yet reported related to these
decisions.

As background, the Ohio Supreme Court’s 1999 decision in Scott-Pontzer greatly
increased the exposure on commercial auto insurance policies. That ruling
extended Ohio businesses’ UM/UIM coverage in force over the past 15 years to
their employees when they were not at work and to the employees’ resident
family members. It contributed to changes in policy wording for UM/UIM
coverage. Additionally, the same court’s 2000 decision in

Linko v. Indemnity

effectively caused insurers to extend UM/UIM coverage, at the newly increased
level of exposure, to every auto insurance policy in Ohio at no additional
premium. The two court rulings affected all auto insurers in the state.

Management’s conclusions regarding reserve levels in 2002 reflected refinement
of the manner in which the value of future salvage and subrogation for claims
already incurred is estimated. Also, management increased reserves for incurred
but not yet reported losses because of higher than expected paid and/or
reported development in workers compensation, commercial casualty, commercial
and other umbrella lines for accident years 1999 through 2001.

Asbestos and Environmental Reserves

Management has reviewed its exposure to asbestos and environmental risk,
including mold risk. Management believes that reserves are adequate at this
time and that these coverage areas are immaterial to the company’s financial
position due to the types of accounts the company has insured in the past.
Factors evaluated to reach those conclusions include:

•

Open claim counts for the long-tail asbestos and environmental losses annually ranged from 400 to 600, or less than 1 percent of the total open claim count, in each of the three years.

•

Loss and loss expenses incurred for all asbestos and environmental claims were $13 million, or 0.7 percent of total loss and loss expense in 2003, compared with $20 million, or 1.2
percent, in 2002 and $7 million, or 0.4 percent, in 2001.



•

Reserves for all asbestos and environmental claims were constant at $71 million in 2003 and 2002, up from $63 million in 2001. Reserves for all asbestos and environmental claims were
2.5 percent, 2.7 percent and 2.7 percent of total reserves, in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Commercial accounts were written by the company after the development of
coverage forms that exclude cleanup costs. The company’s exposure to risks
associated with past production and/or installation of asbestos materials is
minimal because the company was primarily a personal lines company when most of
the asbestos exposure occurred. The commercial coverage the company did offer
was predominantly related to local-market construction activity rather than
asbestos manufacturing. Further, over the past two years, to limit its exposure
to mold and other environmental risks going forward, the company has revised
policy terms where permitted by state regulation.

Reinsurance

The company has property casualty working reinsurance treaties for 2004 through
reinsurance companies that have written its treaties for more than 15 years.
The strong relationships the company has with these reinsurers has allowed the
company to negotiate favorable terms and conditions during a difficult time in
the market cycle. The property casualty working treaties align the company with
three of the most financially sound reinsurance companies in the world. The
company also secures property catastrophe coverage and catastrophic casualty
protection.

The 2004 property and casualty reinsurance program encompasses four primary components:

•

Property per risk treaty – The primary purpose of the property treaty is to
provide excess limits capacity up to $25 million, supplying adequate capacity for
the majority of the risks the company writes. The ceded premium is estimated to be
$27 million for 2004, compared with $25 million in 2003 and 2002. In 2004, the
company is retaining the first $2 million of each loss, and 40 percent of the next
$3 million of loss. The $2 million base retention has been in place for many
years, and the co-participation is the same percentage as 2003, up from 20 percent
in 2002. Losses in excess of $5 million are reinsured at 100 percent up to $25
million.

•

Casualty per occurrence treaty – The casualty treaty provides the company with
excess capacity up to $25 million. Similar to the property treaty, this provides
sufficient capacity to write the vast majority of casualty accounts the company
insures. The ceded premium is estimated to be $60 million in 2004, compared with
$55 million in 2003 and $52 million in 2002. In 2004, the company is retaining the
first $2 million of each casualty loss, and 60 percent of the next $2 million of
loss. This structure is identical to 2003. In 2003, the co-participation rose 40
percent from the 2002 level. Losses in excess of $4 million are reinsured at 100
percent up to $25 million.

•

Casualty fourth excess treaty – The company also purchases a casualty reinsurance
treaty that provides an additional $25 million in casualty loss protection. This
treaty, along with the casualty per occurrence treaty, provides $50 million of
protection for workers compensation losses, bad faith losses and “clash coverage”
when there is a single occurrence involving multiple Cincinnati Insurance Company
policyholders or multiple policies for one insured. The ceded premium is estimated
to be $2 million in 2004 compared with $2 million in both 2003 and 2002.

•

Property catastrophe treaty – To protect against catastrophic events such as wind
and hail, hurricanes or earthquakes, the company purchases property catastrophe
reinsurance, with a limit up to $400 million. For the 2004 treaty, ceded premiums
are estimated to be $25 million, up from $21 million in 2003 and 2002. Part of the
increase for 2004 is due to the increase in the limit to $400 million from $300
million effective April 1, 2003 to keep limits in line with increases in exposures
due to company growth. The company will retain the first $25 million of losses
arising out of a single event and will retain 43 percent of losses from $25
million to $45 million as it did in 2003. The company retains 5 percent of all
losses in excess of $45 million, up to $400 million.

Individual risks with limits in excess of $25 million must be handled by a
different reinsurance mechanism. Property coverage for individual risks with
insured values between $25 million and $50 million are reinsured under an
automatic facultative treaty. For those risks with property values exceeding
$50 million, the company negotiates the purchase of facultative coverage on an
individual certificate basis. For casualty coverage on individual risks with
limits exceeding $25 million, facultative reinsurance coverage is placed on an
individual certificate basis.

Dealing with the challenges presented by terrorism has become a very important
issue for the insurance industry over the last two years. Terrorism coverage at
various levels has been secured in all of the company’s reinsurance agreements.
The broadest coverage for this peril is found in the property and casualty
working treaties, which provides coverage for commercial and personal risks.
Our property catastrophe treaty provides coverage for personal risks and the
majority of our reinsurers provide limited coverage for commercial risks with
total insured values of $10 million or less. For insured values between $10
million and $25 million, there also may be coverage in the property working
treaty.

Reinsurance protection for the company’s surety and life insurance businesses
are covered under separate treaties with many of the same reinsurers that write
the property casualty working treaties.

All reinsurance agreements in place for 2004 are similar to those for 2003 and
2002. The 2004 estimated incremental cost increase of $7 million, net of tax,
is primarily due to the growth in the company’s premium base. The company has
the financial ability to absorb losses at the current retention levels, and the
2004 reinsurance agreements are a means of balancing reinsurance costs with an
acceptable level of risk.

Performance highlights for the commercial lines segment include:

•

Earned premiums – The primary source of
growth in the past three years has been
higher pricing on new and renewal
commercial business and
insurance-to-value initiatives, more then
offsetting the company’s deliberate
decisions not to write or renew certain
business. The growth rate in 2003 slowed
as the rate of premium increases
moderated industrywide.

•

Profitability – Since 2001, improvement
in commercial lines profitability has
primarily been driven by more adequate
premiums per policy, with policy count
relatively stable over the three-year
period. In addition, careful attention to
underwriting has slowed the rate of
growth in loss and loss expenses. The
2003 combined ratio included the benefit
of the software recovery and UM/UIM
reserve release, which reduced the ratio
by 0.8 percentage points and 2.0
percentage points, respectively.

Growth

From mid-1999 into 2003, the commercial lines marketplace implemented continued
rate increases in reaction to concerns about the economy and rising loss
severity, exacerbated by the events of September 11, 2001. Also in response to
rising loss severity, during that period, some competitors announced decisions
to exit geographic markets or specific lines of business; others instituted
across-the-board price increases. Industry analysts believed the market was
experiencing a renewed awareness of underwriting discipline.

Late in 2003, competition increased for high-quality accounts, particularly
from other regional carriers that may have been less affected by market events
in 2001 and 2002. Market conditions now vary substantially between geographic
markets, possibly due to differing economic conditions and the presence of
different groups of competitors. Rate increases for high-quality accounts are
in the low- to mid-single digits. In most markets where the company competes
disciplined underwriting generally remains the norm. In certain markets the
company has seen some indication of carriers
seeking to aggressively price average or below-average accounts. In the
company’s opinion, carriers are modifying pricing rather than changing policy
terms and conditions. Regional and national carriers continue to target the
small accounts market, defined by the company as accounts with premiums under
$10,000 annually.

The company has faced and will continue to address these more competitive
conditions by seeking to remain a stable market for its agencies’ best business
although during this three year period, the company has experienced little or
no growth in commercial lines policy count. The slow growth in policy count
reflected the company’s re-underwriting of the existing book of business and
its insistence on obtaining adequate premium for the covered risks, the
combination into a single commercial package unit of coverages formerly
provided by stand-alone umbrella policies and increased competition for smaller
accounts. Looking ahead, management believes that opportunities to obtain new
business and increase policy count will come from its strong relationships with
independent agencies, subdivision of territories to enhance service and
appointment of up to 150 new agencies over the next several years. Offsetting
new appointments will be continued consolidation within the independent agency
marketplace and terminations of agency relationships.

Staying abreast of evolving market conditions is a critical function,
accomplished in both an informal and a formal manner. Informally, the field
marketing representatives are in constant receipt of market intelligence from
the agencies they work with on a daily basis. Formally, the commercial lines
product management group completes periodic market surveys to obtain
competitive intelligence. This market information helps to determine the top
competitors by line of business or specialty program and also determines market



strengths and weaknesses for the company. The analysis encompasses pricing,
breadth of coverage and underwriting/eligibility issues. In addition to
reviewing the company’s competitive position, the product management group
performs underwriting audits to assess profitability initiatives. Further, the
company’s research and development department analyzes opportunities and
develops new products, new coverage options and improvements to existing
insurance products.

Management considers new business measures to be a key indicator of the success
of its competitive strategies. Locally based field marketing representatives
lead the new business effort, working with agencies to underwrite and price
business using personal and direct knowledge of the risk and competitive
environment. In 2003, commercial new business premiums written directly by
agencies rose 6.8 percent to a record $268 million. In 2002, new business
premiums rose 14.4 percent to $251 million from $220 million in 2001. The lower
2003 growth rate reflected the slowing of premium increases industrywide.

In the five states in which the company had at least $100 million in agency
direct earned premiums in 2003, premiums grew
12.0 percent in 2003 and 16.1 percent in 2002. In the remaining 26 states,
agency direct earned premiums grew more rapidly, rising 16.3 percent in 2003
and 9.0 percent in 2002. The stronger growth in the smaller states reflected
the opportunities available to the company in less penetrated markets.

The company’s standard approach is to write three-year policies, a competitive
advantage in the commercial line market. Although the company offers three-year
terms, many policies are adjustable at each annual anniversary for the
subsequent one-year period, and may be cancelled at any time at the discretion
of the policyholder. While writing three-year policies would appear to restrict
opportunities to quickly adjust pricing, contract terms provide that the rates
for automobile, workers compensation, professional liability and most umbrella
liability coverages within multi-year packages may be changed at each of the
policy’s annual anniversaries for the next one-year period. The annual rate
adjustments could incorporate rate changes approved by state insurance
regulatory authorities between the date the policy was written and its annual
anniversary date, as well as changes in risk exposures and premium credits or
debits relating to loss experience, competition and other underwriting judgment
factors. Management estimates that approximately
75 percent of 2003 commercial premium was written on a one-year policy term or
was subject to annual rating adjustments.

Multi-year packages are offered at rates that may be slightly higher than
annual rates. By reducing annual administrative efforts, multi-year policies
reduce the company’s and agency’s expenses and the incentive for the
policyholder to shop for a new policy every year. Management believes that the
advantages of three-year policies in terms of policyholder convenience, account
retention and reduced administrative costs outweigh the potential disadvantage
of these policies in periods of rising rates.

In 2003, the company resumed writing three-year policies for contractor risks
in most states because of these advantages. In 2002, the company temporarily
had ceased writing three-year policies for contractors in favor of one-year
policies while awaiting state regulatory approval for two significant coverage
changes in the company’s general liability and umbrella coverage forms. The
changes brought the company’s policy forms in line with industry practices by
capping the amount payable during a policy period (usually 12 months) for
certain types of liability claims and by clarifying how a policy responds once
the insured learns that injury or damage has occurred during a prior policy
period. Looking ahead, these changes will help the company better manage
liability losses and remain a viable market for agents to place coverage for
well managed, reputable contractors. Underwriters carefully monitor new and
renewal contractor business, continuing to write one-year policies when
competitive or underwriting issues make three-year policies impractical.

Commercial lines software, which is intended to reduce the administrative
burden on the company’s associates and bring the agencies greater efficiencies,
made further progress in 2003. WinCPP, an online system for commercial lines
rating and price quoting was expanded to 10 states from three and was available
for agencies writing more than 70 percent of the company’s total premiums.
Development of e-CLAS™, a commercial lines policy processing system advanced to
the initial field testing stage for the Businessowners Policy, and this product
is expected to go to the pilot stage with selected Ohio agencies in late 2004.
Through December 31, 2003, capitalized development costs related to e-CLAS
totaled $8 million and management anticipates investing another $11 million in
2004.

Profitability

In addition to seeking more adequate premium per exposure over the past three
years, the company has focused on longer-term efforts to enhance profitability.
These have included confirming what exposures the company has for each risk and
making sure it offers appropriate coverages, terms and conditions and limits of
insurance. The company continues to develop new underwriting
guidelines, to re-underwrite books of business with selected agencies and to
update policy terms and conditions where necessary. In addition, the company
continues to leverage its strong local presence. Over the past three years,
field marketing representatives met with every agency to reaffirm agreements on
the extent of frontline renewal underwriting to be performed by local agencies.
Loss control, machinery and equipment and field claims representatives have
been conducting on-site inspections. Field claims representatives prepare full
risk reports on every account reporting a loss above $100,000 or on any risk of
concern.

Specific actions over the three years that have helped the company achieve these favorable results included:

•

Contractor task force – Initiatives resulting from this review
included developing a supplemental application to better identify
exposures; renewing emphasis on agent and underwriter education in
the area of effective risk transfer techniques, particularly for
general contractors; better managing exposures to apartment or
tract housing development; making residential contractors
ineligible for monoline umbrella liability policies; and excluding
mold and external insulating finishing system (EIFS) exposures,
where allowed by state regulations. Accelerated use of insurance
risk reviews by field claims staff helped manage the loss ratio for
contractors and similar types of businesses, contributing to the
loss ratio improvement for commercial lines.

•

Risk-category reviews – These studies emphasized underwriting
guidelines, such as property age, capacity and loss experience.
While the company continues to evaluate each risk on its own
merits, these risk category reviews have helped underwriters
develop guidelines such as caps on umbrella limits for certain
severity-prone risk categories.



•

Commercial auto task force – This review identified or fine-tuned
underwriting guidelines and procedures, with careful attention to
trucking businesses that specialize in transporting goods for
others, in some cases on a long-haul basis.

•

General liability task force –This study focused on loss trends by
classes of business, severity versus frequency and other metrics
for casualty coverages. The objective was to determine why results
had not responded to the company’s other actions to improve
profitability. The task force completed its analysis in mid-2003.
Based on the findings, the company implemented increased
underwriting and pricing attention for certain states and
territories as well as for general liability classifications that
have historically generated unprofitable results.

These actions have helped to address rising loss severity. The significant components of expenses for the commercial lines segment were:

•

Losses incurred – Losses incurred includes both net paid losses and
reserve additions for unpaid losses. As a result of the
underwriting actions noted above, which have led to higher premiums
on a relatively stable level of exposure, incurred losses declined
to 51.2 percent of earned premiums in 2003, including a 2.0
percentage-point benefit from the UM/UIM reserve release, from 57.8
percent in 2002 and 62.3 percent in 2001. Management monitors
incurred losses by size of loss, business line, risk category,
geographic region, agency, field marketing territory and duration
of policyholder relationship, addressing concentrations or trends
as needed. Analysis indicated no significant concentrations beyond
that seen in higher loss ratios for certain business lines, which
management has addressed.

Looking at commercial lines loss data by size, management evaluates new
losses and case reserve adjustments greater than $250,000 to track frequency
and severity. Analysis of loss data by average size of loss supports
management’s belief that the increase in loss severity is not a temporary
phenomenon. However, new losses between $250,000 and $1 million and case
reserve increases greater than $250,000, declined as a percentage of earned
premiums in each of the past two years. New losses greater than $1 million
declined as a percentage of earned premium in 2003 after rising 1.0
percentage point in 2002.

•

Loss expenses incurred – Loss expenses incurred were stable as a percent of earned premium in 2003 and 2002 after rising in 2001 because of higher loss expense reserves.

•

Catastrophe losses – Commercial lines catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and before taxes, were $42 million in 2003, compared with $40 million in 2002 and $28 million in 2001, which included $9 million for
losses related to events of
September 11, 2001.

•

Underwriting expenses incurred — In 2003 the ratio was reduced by 0.8 percentage points due to the software recovery. In 2003, commission expense rose by 1.3 percentage points as total contingent (profit-based)
commissions were two times the level of the prior year because of strong recent results. The company relies on its independent agencies as frontline underwriters who know the businesses and individuals in their
communities; many agencies are benefiting from their hard work over the past several years. Depreciation of capitalized costs in 2003 was 0.2 percentage points higher than the prior year as significant technological
initiatives moved into service. Over the three-year period, non-commission expenses remained steady as a percent of earned premiums.

•

Policyholder dividends incurred – Policyholder dividend expense as a percent of earned premiums was 0.8 percent in 2003 compared with 0.3 percent in 2002 and 1.1 percentage points in 2001. The rise between 2003 and
2002 reflected increased estimates of workers compensation dividends. The decline between 2002 and 2001 was due to the company’s emphasis on pricing for workers compensation as well as its decision not to write or
renew many of these policies.

In total, commercial multi-peril, workers compensation, commercial auto and
other liability accounted for 90.5 percent of total commercial lines earned
premium in 2003 compared with 90.5 percent in 2002 and 91.5 percent in 2001.
Approximately 95 percent of the company’s commercial lines premiums are written
for accounts with coverages from more than one business lines. The company
believes that its commercial lines area is best measured and evaluated on a
segment basis. For reference, however, the table above and discussion below
summarizes growth and profitability trends separately for each of the four
primary business lines.

The accident year loss data provides current estimates of accident year
incurred loss and loss expenses for the past five years. Accident year data
shows the year in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are
actually reported, booked or paid.



Over the past three years, results for the business lines within the commercial
lines segment have reflected the company’s emphasis on underwriting and
obtaining adequate pricing for the covered risk, as discussed above. Other
factors that have affected results for these lines included:

•

Commercial multi-peril – As noted above, the company wrote a higher than
normal number of one-year policies in 2002 pending regulatory approval for
changes in policy terms and conditions. In addition to industrywide
slowing in premium growth, this decision affected the 2003 and 2002 growth
rates for the company’s commercial multi-peril business line as some
liability coverages previously written in premium discounted packages were
moved to non-discounted policies, which are included in the other
liability line of business.

The loss and loss expenses ratio declined steadily over the three-year
period. This is the company’s single largest business line and the loss data
are the best indicators of the success of the growth and underwriting actions
that have been implemented in the past three years. Higher general liability
base rates were effective in most states during 2003. This contributed to
further improvement in the loss and loss expenses ratio in 2003. In 2002,
underwriting and pricing initiatives also contributed, including package
discount eligibility reviews, elimination or reduction of discounts,
promotion of insurance-to-value levels and the salvage and subrogation
reserve. The overall effect of these actions improved the loss and loss
expenses ratio by 3.9 percentage points in 2003 and 7.6 percentage points in
2002. Additions of $27 million to reserves for older accident years offset
the improvement by 4.4 percentage points in 2002.

•

Workers compensation – Conditions within the workers compensation
market improved between 1999 and 2003 as market pricing rose in most
states, albeit offset by continued rising trends in loss severity. As
indicated by the rapid rise in premium volume of state pools for
workers compensation, many carriers chose to exit significant portions
of this line of business. While the company remains highly selective
about the risks covered, workers compensation is available in packages
for commercial lines policyholders, maintaining the company’s
competitive position in selected states. Workers compensation has a
lower commission ratio than the other commercial business lines.

In 2003 and 2002 the company chose not to renew selected policies where the
aggregate terrorism exposure risk was excessive. Any new or renewal policy
covering 200 or more employees at any one location received added scrutiny as
the company sought to manage risk aggregation. On the basis of new business
premiums written directly by agents, new workers compensation premiums rose
5.9 percent in 2003 after declining 17.4 percent in 2002 and 18.4 percent in
2001. Total workers compensation earned premiums were unchanged between 2003
and 2002 because of rate increases offset by a decline in policy count due to
the re-underwriting effort.

The workers compensation loss and loss expense ratio has been steady for
three years. Overall pricing increases for new and renewed risks and
underwriting actions have helped to bring about declining accident year loss
ratios over the three-year period. The loss and loss expenses ratio in 2002
reflected the addition of $23 million to IBNR for older accident years,
offset by the salvage and subrogation reserve. Higher than expected paid and
reported loss development, primarily in accident years 2001 and 2000,
accounted for $21 million of the 2002 IBNR change.

•

Commercial auto – Commercial auto premium growth trends reflected the
factors influencing overall commercial lines performance with the primary
driver being price increases.

In the past several years, the company accelerated efforts to improve
commercial automobile underwriting and rate levels, making certain that
vehicle use was properly classified. As a result, the loss and loss expenses
ratio for commercial auto improved in each of the past three years. Further,
a task force studied loss patterns in this business line and recommended new
or revised underwriting guidelines to assure accurate classification and
pricing. As part of the company’s overall emphasis on underwriting, risk
information is being more closely scrutinized, generally resulting in higher
pricing for renewal policyholders. The 2003 UM/UIM reserve release had its
most substantial impact on the commercial auto line, lowering the full-year
loss and loss expense ratio by 6.9 percentage points. The 2002 ratio
benefited by 7.5 percentage points from the salvage and subrogation reserve.

•

Other liability (commercial umbrella, commercial general liability and
most executive risk policies) – Earned premium growth for the other
liability line continued at a higher pace in 2003 because of the number of
policies written in non-discounted programs and the continuing rise in
liability pricing. Other liability policy count has been stable as growth
in the number of non-discounted policies has offset declines in other
areas, in part due to a change that allowed umbrella coverages to be
endorsed to a primary policy rather than be written separately.

For professional liability coverages, particularly nursing home professional
liability, the company narrowed the underwriting criteria and significantly
increased rates. Directors and officers coverage accounted for 12 percent of
other liability premium in 2003. Director and officer policies are offered
primarily to non-profit organizations, reducing the risk associated with this
line of business; only 35 in-force director and officer policies as of
December 31, 2003, are for publicly traded companies and only nine are for
Fortune 1000 companies.

The loss and loss expense ratio for other liability declined by 24.2
percentage points in 2003 due to current accident year results below historic
levels and improvements in older accident year results. The 2003 ratio also
benefited by 2.6 percentage points due to the UM/UIM reserve release. The
ratio increased by 18.9 percentage points in 2002. Higher than anticipated
accident year 2002 losses for umbrella business resulted in a $19 million
IBNR increase in 2002, adding 6.9 percentage points to the calendar year 2002
ratio.

Commercial Lines Outlook

During 2004, the company anticipates commercial lines insurance market trends
will reflect the industry’s increasing surplus, improving profitability and
growing capacity. The company will continue to markets its products to a broad
range of business classes, price its products adequately and take a package
approach.



On a written premium basis, management anticipates commercial growth of
approximately 10 percent if market conditions remain stable. The company
expects competition to accelerate for property lines of business due to the
historical profitability of this business area and the short-tail exposures
associated with it. Conversely, management anticipates somewhat firmer market
conditions to continue for casualty lines of business. This is due to
profitability challenges and an inflationary legal environment related to these
long-tail exposure lines.

By evaluating each risk individually and making decisions regarding rates, the
use of three-year policies and other policy terms on a case-by-case basis, even
in lines and classes of business that are under pressure, the company believes
it can continue to be a preferred market for its agencies and the types of Main
Street businesses they serve. This should lead to incremental improvements in
its already strong combined ratio.

Performance highlights for the personal lines segment include:

•

Earned premiums – The sources of
increasing growth in the past three years
were rate increases on new and renewal
personal lines business. Agencies and
policyholders in the uncertain marketplace
are attracted to the company’s fair
pricing and long-term approach.

•

Combined ratio – The combined ratio
improved steadily, reflecting the
relatively stable loss and loss expense
ratio in personal auto and the improving
ratio for homeowners due to higher
premiums.

Already unprofitable due to years of inadequate pricing, industrywide personal
lines insurance saw loss ratios further deteriorate in 2001, primarily because
the homeowners market experienced an upswing in water damage and mold claims.
In response, insurance companies have sought rate increases and added coverage
exclusions for the homeowner line. A number of carriers have taken dramatic
steps, restricting new business and exiting certain territories. For many
insurance companies marketing homeowner products, responses to those issues
already are substantially improving their results. While the personal
automobile area has been less volatile in recent years, many carriers continued
to seek rate increases throughout 2003 to keep up with rising claim costs.



Growth

Management considers new business measures to be a key indicator of the success
of its competitive strategies. In 2003, personal lines new business premiums
written directly by agencies declined 9.3 percent to $60 million. In 2002, new
business premiums rose 27.2 percent to $66 million from $52 million in 2001.
The decline in new business growth in 2003 reflected the company’s emphasis on
underwriting personal lines. In addition, recent homeowner rate increases
brought pricing more in line with industry averages, potentially diminishing a
differentiating factor for more price-sensitive consumers. Further, agencies
may be placing less business with the company until the introduction of the
personal lines policy processing system in their state.

In the six states in which the company wrote $35 million or more in personal
lines agency direct earned premium in 2003, premiums grew 8.3 percent in 2003
and 7.0 percent in 2002. In the remaining 25 states, agency direct earned
premiums grew more rapidly, rising 15.9 percent in 2003 and 12.0 percent in
2002. Similar to commercial lines, the stronger growth in the smaller states
reflected the opportunities available to the company in less penetrated
markets.

In August 2002, the company introduced Diamond, a Web-based policy processing
system for personal lines products, to agencies in Kansas. The single-entry
data processing system streamlines policy issue, reduces processing time to
improve cash flow and offers direct billing. Longer-term, management believes
this program could have a substantial positive benefit on premium growth as the
technology presents solutions sought by independent agencies. State-by-state
development and rollout will take place over the coming years as the software
undergoes upgrades and modifications to accommodate each state’s rules and
rates. Agencies in three of the company’s most significant personal lines
states –Indiana, Michigan and Ohio – are targeted for deployment in 2004.
Through December 31, 2003, capitalized development costs related to the project
totaled $25 million. In 2004, management anticipates investing another $10
million.

Profitability

While generally seeking to leverage the relationships with the company’s
independent agencies, efforts to improve personal lines profitability have
focused on the personal auto and homeowner business lines as discussed below.
The significant components of expenses for the personal lines segment were:

•

Losses incurred – Losses incurred includes both net paid losses and
reserve additions for unpaid losses. For personal lines, losses incurred
rose to $513 million in 2003 from $476 million in 2002 and 2001 as the
number of policies grew slightly over the three-year period. That
reflected the industrywide rise in loss severity over the past several
years due to escalating medical costs and home values. Management monitors
incurred losses by size of loss, business line, risk category, geographic
region, agency, field marketing territory and duration of policyholder
relationship, addressing concentrations or trends as needed. Analysis
indicated no significant concentrations beyond that seen in higher loss
ratios for certain business lines, which management has addressed.

Looking at personal lines loss data by size, management evaluates new losses
and case reserve adjustments greater than $250,000 to track frequency and
severity. Analysis of loss data by average size of loss supports management’s
belief that the increase in loss severity is not a temporary phenomenon. For
personal lines, losses greater than $1 million have stabilized on both an
absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of earned premium in the past two
years after rising from 2001’s level. However, losses between $250,000 and $1
million continue to rise, in line with higher overall loss severity. Case
reserve increases greater than $250,000 declined as a percentage of earned
premiums in 2003 after rising sharply in 2002. Management remains focused on
establishing adequate case reserves at the time a claim is reported.



•

Loss expenses incurred were stable as a percent of earned premium in 2003 and 2002 after rising in 2001 because of higher loss expense reserves.

•

Catastrophe losses – Personal lines catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and before taxes, were $55 million in 2003 compared with $47 million in 2002 and $36 million in 2001.

•

Underwriting expenses incurred – In 2003 the ratio was reduced by 1.1 percentage points due to the software recovery. Over the three-year period, expenses have declined as a
percent of earned premiums because premiums are rising more rapidly than overhead and contingent commissions have been steady. Depreciation of capitalized costs in 2003 was
0.2 percentage points higher than the prior year as significant technological initiatives moved into service.

The personal auto and homeowner business lines together accounted for 89.5
percent, 89.4 percent and 89.0 percent of total personal lines earned premiums
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The company’s intent is to write personal
auto and homeowners coverages in personal lines packages. The company believes
that personal lines is best measured and evaluated on a segment basis. For
reference, however, the table and discussion below summarizes growth and
profitability trends for the personal auto and homeowner business lines.

The accident year loss data provides current estimates of accident year
incurred loss and loss expenses for the past five years. Accident year data
shows the year in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are
actually reported, booked or paid.

Personal auto – Earned premiums for personal auto grew 9.8 percent, 7.9 percent
and 3.8 percent in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The growth was driven by
continued market penetration and the effect of rate increases beginning in late
2002. Rate increases ranging from 5 percent to 8 percent went into effect in
four of the six largest personal lines states in 2003. Additional single-digit
increases have been filed and approved for 10 states for 2004, including
increases in the range of 4 percent to 6 percent in three of the six largest
personal lines states. Management believes the company’s personal auto rates
remain competitive.

Over the last three years, the benefits of a personal auto re-underwriting
program generally served to offset rising loss severity. The program reviewed
and strengthened underwriting standards, required motor vehicle reports for
many insured drivers and obtained commitments for selected agencies to provide
the company with specific premium volume increases. The loss and loss expense
ratio for personal auto was relatively constant at 71.1 percent in 2003, 67.6
percent in 2002 and 70.6 percent in 2001. The 2002 ratio included a 5.0
percentage-point benefit from the salvage and subrogation reserve.

The planned rate increases and introduction of the Diamond policy processing
system into larger states should contribute to earned premium growth in 2004
and beyond. Management believes the loss and loss expense ratio for personal
auto could improve slightly over the next year as underwriting efforts continue
to enhance profitability.

Homeowner – Earned premiums for homeowners grew 14.0 percent, 10.0 percent and
6.3 percent in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Catastrophe losses
contributed 19.9 percentage points, 20.3 percentage points and 23.5 percentage
points to the homeowner loss and loss expense ratio in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Although the loss and loss expense ratio for the



homeowner line
declined to 92.7 percent in 2003 from 98.6 percent in 2002 and 108.9 percent in
2001, the ratio remains above the 72 percent to 74 percent quarterly level the
company has targeted for the end of 2005.

To obtain profitability for the homeowner line, the three most significant actions taken are summarized below:

•

Rate changes – In 2003, 23 rate increases were effective in 21 of the
25 states in which the company writes homeowners policies. Four of the
company’s six largest personal lines states as measured by homeowner
premium volume experienced rate increases in the 10 percent to 20
percent range in 2003. Additional rate increases in the 5 percent to 18
percent range have been filed and approved for 2004 in these same
states. At the same time, the personal lines underwriters are focusing
on insurance-to-value initiatives to verify the company is receiving
the correct level of premium for the value of the insured risk. Rate
changes are applied to new business and to existing policies as they
come up for renewal. Management believes the company’s homeowner rates
remain competitive.

•

Changes in policy terms and conditions – Over the past three years, the
company has identified specific coverage areas for updating to increase
its control over risk and pricing. For most policyholders, the company
has capped the guaranteed replacement cost coverage at 125 percent of
the amount chosen by the policyholder to insure the home; previously,
full replacement coverage without a maximum was standard for the
company. For water damage, which represented 22 percent of losses in
2003, 21 percent of losses in 2002 and 19 percent of losses in 2001,
the
company changed its coverage form to let policyholders choose and pay for the
level of coverage they need rather than include broadened coverage with all
policies. The guaranteed replacement cost coverage change and water damage
endorsement began to roll out in September 2002 in three major personal lines
states, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana, which accounted for 49.2 percent of 2003
homeowner earned premium. These changes were approved in all but two of the
homeowner states at year-end 2003.

•

Shift to one-year policies – In conjunction with the
deployment of the Diamond personal lines policy
processing system, the company will begin to write
homeowner policies on a one-year basis instead of
three-years. One-year policies will allow the company
to modify rates, terms and conditions more rapidly
when necessary. Homeowner policies were being written
on a one-year basis beginning in January 2004 in
Indiana and Michigan and February 2004 in Ohio. Other
states will shift to one-year policies in advance of
the Diamond deployment for each specific state.
Diamond will provide greater efficiencies to assist
the company and its agencies in processing annual
renewals.

The combined impact of these changes in rates and policy terms and conditions
is seen as existing three-year policies renew. For example, in Ohio, which
accounts for 32.2 percent of the company’s total homeowner earned premium,
typical policyholders coming off a three-year term are experiencing
approximately a 40 percent increase in total premium for their 2004 renewal
policy. This reflects all rate increases, insured value and policy changes that
were effective over the three-year policy cycle that is coming to an end. Ohio
policies are being renewed on a one-year policy term beginning in early in
2004.

Personal Lines Outlook

Management is maintaining reasonable growth projections for the personal lines
area as the company prepares for the introduction of the new personal lines
processing system in the key states of Indiana, Michigan and Ohio in the first
half of 2004. The training program for agency representatives in Indiana and
Michigan should be completed in the first half of 2004 and in Ohio during the
fourth quarter of 2004. After that education effort is complete, the company
has identified Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky for the next
round of deployment. The new system will make it easier for agents to place
personal auto, homeowners and other personal lines business with the company
while greatly increasing policy issuance efficiency and providing direct bill
capabilities. It currently is in use in the company’s Kansas agencies and is
undergoing a series of upgrades and modifications to accommodate each state’s
rules and rates. The appointment of new agencies over the next several years
also could contribute to personal lines growth.

In addition, management believes that it has in place strategies to improve the
profitability of its homeowner line of business while maintaining or slightly
improving personal auto profitability. While primarily focusing on longer-term
targets for the homeowner line because of the existing base of three-year
policies, as the company continues to work through the renewal policy cycle,
management expects to see quarter-over-quarter improvement in loss and loss
expenses ratios in 2004 and beyond.

Performance highlights for the life insurance segment include:

•

Revenues – Revenue growth has accelerated
over the past three years as the company
increased life policy face amounts in
force to $38.492 billion in 2003 from
$32.486 billion at year-end 2002 and
$27.534 billion at year-end 2001.

•

Profitability – The life insurance segment
reports a GAAP-based segment loss because
investment income is included in
investment segment results, except
investment income credited to contract
holders (interest assumed in life
insurance policy reserve calculations).

At the same time, management recognizes that assets under management, capital
appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluation of the success
of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products.
For that reason, management also evaluates GAAP data including results for
investment activities on life insurance-related assets for The Cincinnati
Life Insurance Company subsidiary, which comprises the life insurance
segment. Looking at a key performance indicator for Cincinnati Life, GAAP net
income grew 25.8 percent in 2003 to $22 million from $17 million in 2002 and
$26 million in 2001. Results improved in 2003 because operating expenses
remained level and mortality experience remained within pricing guidelines as
premiums continued to rise. The decline in 2002 was due in part to increased
regulatory and legal cost. GAAP net income in 2001 exceeded that of both 2003
and 2002 primarily because of higher capital losses in those years.

Growth

Cincinnati Life offers a full line of whole, term and universal life products,
fixed annuities and disability income products. Revenues are derived
principally from:

•

premiums from traditional products, principally term insurance, which contributed 71.7 percent of 2003 revenues

•

fee income from interest-sensitive products, principally universal life insurance, which contributed 26.0 percent of 2003 revenue

•

asset management fee income, generated primarily from separate account assets, which contributed 2.3 percent of 2003 revenue

The company’s life insurance subsidiary reported 2003 statutory written life
premium of $102 million, compared with $131 million in 2002, which included the
sale of a single $33 million general account bank-owned life insurance policy,
and $89 million in 2001. Statutory written premiums have been reclassified to
exclude annuity deposits not involving life contingencies, which are not
recognized as written premium under statutory rules. New annuity sales were $37
million in 2003 compared with $85 million in 2002 and $10 million in 2001. The
growth in 2002 annuity sales was attributable to the fixed rates and guaranteed
income features that were attractive in 2002’s economic climate.

While the life insurance industry generally experienced declines during 2003 in
applications submitted and face amount issued, the company’s life insurance
segment experienced a 5.9 percent rise in applications submitted and a 20.0
percent increase in face amount issued due to continued strong sales of term
insurance marketed through the company’s property casualty agency force.

Cincinnati Life continues to introduce new and enhanced products specifically
designed for property casualty agencies. The LifeHorizons Whole Life, Universal
Life and Disability Income products are well suited for financial, estate and
business planning. Approximately 75 percent of the company’s premium volume for
these products comes from the property casualty agencies, with the remaining 25
percent from independent life agencies.

In 2002, the life insurance industry was challenged by a number of
factors, including the higher-than-historic level of bond defaults, stock
market declines that impacted variable annuities and competitive pressures that
affected rates for term products. As a result, the industry saw an overall
decline in statutory surplus, accelerated write-downs of deferred acquisition
costs and lower income. In combination, these factors resulted in ratings
downgrades for many life insurance companies during 2002.

During the same period, many large, widely known life insurance companies have
transitioned to investor-owned companies from mutual companies. Industry
analysts believe these transitions could result in accelerated consolidation in
the life insurance industry.



The future presence of larger competitors could
have a negative impact on smaller, stand-alone life insurance companies because
of their potentially greater efficiency and their ability to be more aggressive
in setting prices as rating agencies continue to downgrade the financial
strength of numerous companies.

Management believes such pressures are mitigated for the life insurance company
because of its association with the property casualty operations, its leverage
of the property casualty agency franchise and its careful selection of
independent agencies. Within this marketplace, Cincinnati Life is able to be
competitive and attracts its share of business from the property casualty
agencies with which the company has strong relationships, especially as other
property casualty companies continue to exit the life business.

As the economy improved in 2003, the level of bond defaults and impairments
improved to historic levels. Interest rates earned on new investments remained
at historically low levels. Most of the company’s interest-sensitive life and
deferred annuity contracts contain guaranteed crediting rates of 3.0 percent to
5.0 percent. The company’s average interest rate earned overall on its
investment portfolio, while decreasing in this period, still provides ample
margins to allow for maintenance of pricing spreads when determining
interest-crediting rates.

Over the past several years, the life insurance company has worked to introduce
a portfolio of new and enhanced products, primarily under the LifeHorizons
name. For example, during 2003, the company introduced a new guaranteed whole
life policy and a non-cancelable rider for its disability income product. In
2002, the life company revised the rates for the LifeHorizons term series and
introduced a new risk classification system that better matches risk profile
and rate. Other recent launches in the LifeHorizons product series included a
simplified term policy specifically for clients of the company’s property
casualty agencies.

In 2004, Cincinnati Life continues to enhance the LifeHorizons portfolio of
products to meet changing needs of both consumers and agencies. Product
development centers on mortality-oriented products combined with contract
guarantees. Distribution expansion into western and northeastern states is a
high priority, and management anticipates adding a life field marketing
representative for the northeast in 2004.

Profitability

Life segment expenses consist principally of:

•

Insurance benefits paid and reserve increases, primarily related to traditional life products, which accounted for 63.6 percent of 2003 expenses

•

Commissions, general and other business expenses, net of deferred acquisition costs, accounted for 36.4 percent of 2003 expenses

Segment profitability depends largely on premium levels, the adequacy of
product pricing, underwriting skill and operating efficiencies. Life segment
results include only investment interest credited to contract holders (interest
assumed in life insurance policy reserve calculations). The remaining
investment income is reported in the investment segment results. The life
investment portfolio is managed to earn target spreads between earned
investment rates on general account assets and rates credited to policyholders.
Management considers the amount of assets under management and the life
investment portfolio investment income as key performance indicators for the
life insurance segment.

The life insurance company maintains a competitive advantage with respect to
benefits paid and reserve increases by consistently achieving better than
average claims experience due to skilled underwriting. Commissions paid by the
life insurance operation are on par with industry averages. During the past
three years, the company has invested in imaging and workflow technology. As a
result, the efficiency of application processing has improved significantly.
During this period, submitted applications have increased at an annualized rate
of approximately 6 percent, while staff involved with the underwriting and
policy issue has declined 5 percent. This has been accomplished while
maintaining the company’s service standards.

Life Insurance Outlook

In 2004 the life insurance company will introduce a long-term guaranteed
universal life plan to further expand its product portfolio. As the life
insurance company seeks to increase penetration of the property casualty
agencies, management’s objective is growth in the premium base through the sale
of new products, in particular term insurance, which would place more emphasis
on growth in statutory gross and net written premiums.

The investment segment contributes investment income and realized gains and
losses to results of operations. Investments provide the company’s primary
source of pretax and after-tax profits.

•

Investment income – Pretax investment income reached a new record of
$465 million in 2003, rising 4.7 percent from the prior record in
2002. Growth in investment income over the past two years has been
driven by strong cash flow for new investments and increased dividend
income from the common stock portfolio.

•

Realized gains and losses – Realized losses were substantially lower
in 2003 than 2002. Due to the economic and market recovery, fewer
other-than-temporary impairment charges were recorded in the second
half of the year. Offsetting full-year
other-than-temporary impairment charges primarily were net gains on the sale
of securities. Realized losses rose in 2002 due to higher impairment charges.

Investment Income

The advantages of strong cash flow in the past three years have been somewhat
offset by the effect of the weak economy on overall market conditions and the
challenge of reinvesting proceeds from called or redeemed bonds at lower
prevailing interest rates. Overall, dividends contributed 48.8 percent of
pretax investment income in 2003, up from 46.9 percent in 2002 and 45.9 in
2001. The higher contribution was primarily because of lower yields on the
fixed-income portfolio and dividend increases from companies in the common
stock portfolio. In 2003, 29 of the 51 common stock holdings in the portfolio
raised their indicated dividend payout, as did 28 of the 46 in 2002. The 2003
increases should add approximately $16 million to investment income on an
annualized basis. Fifth Third, the company’s largest equity holding,
contributed 60 percent of the increase and 41.8 percent of total dividend
income in 2003.

Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses

Over the past three years, net realized investment losses have been made up of
other-than-temporary impairment charges, realized investment gains and losses
on the sale of securities and changes in the valuation of embedded derivatives
within certain convertible securities. These three areas are discussed below:

Other-than-temporary impairment charges

In 2003, the company recorded $80 million in write-downs of securities
management deemed had experienced an other-than-temporary decline in market
value versus $98 million in 2002 and $45 million in 2001. See Asset Impairment,
Page 19, for factors considered by management. These other-than-temporary
impairment charges represented 0.6 percent, 0.9 percent and 0.4 percent of
total invested assets at year-end 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Also
included in other-than-temporary impairments are unrealized losses of holdings
that the company has identified for sale but not yet completed a transaction.

Lingering weakness in the economy during the first half of 2003 led to the
continued write-downs of securities that management deemed had experienced
other-than-temporary declines in market value. Of the $80 million in
other-than-temporary write-downs in 2003, $69 million occurred in the first six
months of the year.



The majority of the write-downs in 2003 related to 31 high-yield corporate
bonds written down $39 million and 10 convertible securities written down $26
million. Unlike the prior year, the market value declines in 2003 were related
to company-specific events rather than industry issues. Utility/merchant
energy/trading, airline and healthcare bonds represented 72.1 percent of 2003
and 42.9 percent of 2002 impairment charges:

•

Utility/merchant energy/trading – Valuations throughout the industry
were affected by mismanagement of trading operations and accounting
irregularities regarding the booking of revenues and the valuation of
trading contracts.

•

Airline – In 2002, management recorded other-than-temporary impairment
charges for all unsecured airline-related bonds due to the overall
outlook for that industry, even if they did not otherwise meet the
company’s asset impairment criteria. Secured notes, or those that have
aircraft as collateral for the trust certificate were not impaired
except for two carriers in bankruptcy
proceedings (UAL Corporation/United Airlines and US Airways Group, Inc./US
Airways). Additional impairments in 2003 were for selected secured bonds that
management believed had inferior collateral.

The other-than-temporary impairments of airline-related bonds as well as
sales of securities reduced the company’s exposure to this industry to
approximately $57 million at year-end 2003, down from $140.0 million at
year-end 2001.

•

Healthcare – The 2003 healthcare impairment charges related primarily to
the sudden default by Healthsouth Corporation and subsequent fraud
charges. These securities have since recovered and all coupon payments
have been made.

At December 31, 2003, they were trading above their pre-default level.

Other-than temporary impairment charges by industry are summarized as follows:

Realized investment gains and losses

In 2003, the company recorded $30 million in net realized investment gains
compared with $8 million in 2002 and $11 million 2001. The company buys and
sells securities on an ongoing basis to help achieve its portfolio objectives.
Although the company prefers to hold fixed-income securities until maturity, a
decision to sell reflects management’s perception of a change in the underlying
fundamentals of the security and preference to allocate those funds to
investments that more closely meet the established parameters for long-term
stability and growth. Management’s opinion that the security fundamentally no
longer meets the company’s investment expectations may reflect a loss of
confidence in the issuer’s management, a change in underlying risk factors
(such as political risk, regulatory risk, sector risk or credit risk), or a
recovery from a previously impaired value.

Changes in the valuation of embedded derivatives

In 2003, the company recorded $9 million in fair value increases versus $4
million in fair value declines in 2002 and $9 million in fair value increases
in 2001 due to the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(SFAS) No. 133, which requires measurement of the fluctuations in the value of
the embedded derivative features in selected convertible securities. See Note 1
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 58, for details on the
accounting for convertible security embedded options.

Investments Outlook

Management believes that it can achieve investment income growth of 3.5 percent
to 4.5 percent in 2004 as a result of the anticipated growth in dividend
income, strong cash flow from insurance operations and overall portfolio
growth. While management does not forecast realized investment gains and
losses, it believes that impairment charges in 2004 will be limited to
securities marked to market because they have been identified for sale, or
those where issuer-specific events cause sharp declines in market value with
little or no warning.

Other

Operations of the parent company, CFC Investment Company and CinFin Capital
Management Company, excluding investment activities, and other income of the
insurance subsidiaries resulted in $7 million in revenues in 2003, down from
$14 million in 2002 and $10 million in 2001. Losses before income taxes of $38
million, $32 million and $37 million recorded in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, were primarily due to interest expense from debt of the parent
company and operating expenses of the company’s headquarters.

Taxes

The company’s income tax expense was $106 million, $41 million and $28 million
for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, while the effective tax rate was 22.0
percent, 14.8 percent and 12.7 percent for the same periods. Investment
operations are the company’s primary source of profits. The company pursues a
strategy of investing in tax-advantaged fixed maturities and equity securities
to minimize its overall tax liability and maximize after-tax earnings. A 2003
GAAP net underwriting gain of $140 million increased the company’s tax expense
compared with a gain of $7 million in 2002 and a loss of $102 million in 2001.
The differences in income tax expense and the effective tax rate during the
period were primarily the company’s tax-exempt interest and dividends received
exclusion. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 66, for
detail regarding the company’s effective income tax rate. Management
anticipates that the effective tax rate will be in the 21 percent to 24 percent
range if the company continues to achieve its performance objectives of an
underwriting profit, growth in investment income and more normalized realized
investment gains.

Liquidity is a measure of the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash
flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of business
obligations. The company’s primary means of meeting its liquidity requirements
are through dividends from its insurance subsidiaries and investment income
from its investment portfolio. The parent company’s cash requirements include
general operating expenses, interest payments on its debt, dividends to
shareholders and common stock repurchases. The company’s lines of credit also
provide another potential source of short-term liquidity.

The property casualty and life insurance operations’ short-term cash needs
primarily consist of paying insurance loss and loss expenses and ongoing
operating expenses. Those needs are met through cash flows from insurance
premiums and investment income. Although the company has never sold investments
to pay claims, the sale of investments would provide an additional source of
liquidity, if required.

After satisfying short-term cash requirements, excess cash flows from
underwriting and investment activities are used to build the investment
portfolio, leading to the potential for increases in future investment income
and realized gains. Underwriting generates positive cash flows because cash
from premium payments generally is received in advance of cash payments
required to settle claims.

The company’s property casualty and life insurance operations generated
positive cash flows from underwriting of $472 million,
$441 million and $478 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This strong
underwriting cash flow was primarily due to growth of premiums in the past
three years. In addition, investment income from the insurance operations
generated cash flows of $332 million, $316 million and $298 million in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the insurance subsidiaries invested $1.398 billion,
$843 million and $708 million in fixed-income and equity securities. Those
purchases were offset by sales of fixed-income securities totaling $143
million, $64 million and $19 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Calls and maturities of fixed-income securities added $389 million, $219
million and $186 million to cash flow in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Sales, calls or maturities of equity and equity-linked securities totaled $209
million,
$98 million and $187 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. See Item 1,
Investments Segment, Page 7, for a discussion of the portfolio allocation and
quality.

As described in Item 1, Regulations, Page 10, and Note 8 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Page 65, dividends paid to the parent company by its
insurance subsidiary are restricted by Ohio regulatory requirements. Further,
management intends for all insurance subsidiaries to maintain their superior
financial strength ratings, which may constrain their dividend-paying capacity.
In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the company’s insurance subsidiary paid dividends of
$50 million, $100 million and $100 million, respectively, to the parent
company.

As a result of investment income from its investments and dividends and
borrowings from its insurance subsidiary, the parent company met its cash
requirements for general operating expenses, interest payments on its long- and
short- term debt, dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchase.
Investing activities generated $48 million of cash flow in 2003 after using $39
million in 2002 and $34 million in 2001.

Dividends

Cincinnati Financial has increased the indicated annual cash dividend rate to
shareholders for 44 consecutive years and, periodically, the board of directors
authorizes stock dividends or splits. In January 2004, the board of directors
authorized a 10.0 percent increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to an
indicated annual rate of $1.10. In February 2003, the board of directors
authorized a
12.4 percent increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to an indicated
annual rate of $1.00. In February 2002, the board authorized a 6.0 percent
increase; and in February 2001, a 10.5 percent increase.

In January 2004, the board also authorized a 5 percent stock dividend payable
June 15, 2004, to shareholders of record April 30, 2004. This is the 28th stock
dividend or split declared over the past 47 years.



Over the past 10 years, the company has paid an average of 45 percent of net
income as dividends, with the remaining 55 percent reinvested for future
growth. The ability of the company to continue paying cash dividends is subject
to factors the board of directors may deem relevant.

Common Stock Repurchase

The Cincinnati Financial board believes that stock repurchases can help fulfill
the company’s commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Consequently, the
company’s board has authorized the repurchase of outstanding shares. In 2003,
repurchases were made as follows:

Remaining shares authorized for repurchase

5,278,000

Common stock repurchases for treasury have continued at a steady pace over the
last several years and occur whenever management believes that stock prices on
the open market are favorable for such repurchases. At a minimum, the company
would expect to offset dilution of option exercises. Shares repurchased total
15.6 million, at a total cost to the company of $520 million, since the
inception of the share repurchase program in 1996. At December 31, 2003, 5.3
million shares remain authorized for repurchase.

Outlook

Management continues to believe that cash provided by operating activities will
continue to be the primary source of funds for the company. Future liquidity
could be affected by catastrophe losses in excess of the company’s catastrophe
reinsurance treaties, which provide coverage for gross losses up to $400
million. The company has no significant exposure to assumed reinsurance, which
accounted for no more than 2.4 percent of earned premiums in each of the last
three years and is expected to remain at or near this level in 2004.

Management anticipates its insurance subsidiary will pay dividends of at least
$75 million to the parent company in 2004. During 2004, the company will
determine the timeline for developing additional space at its headquarters
location although management anticipates no extraordinary cash outlays in the
next two years.

Assets

At December 31, 2003, the investment portfolio made up 80.3 percent of total
assets. The remainder consisted primarily of other invested assets (0.5
percent), premium receivables (6.8 percent), reinsurance receivables (4.0
percent), deferred acquisition costs
(2.4 percent) and separate accounts (3.0 percent). These percentages have
remained relatively constant over the last few years.

Total assets increased 9.8 percent, or $1.387 billion, to $15.509 billion at
December 31, 2003. The increase primarily reflected:

•

$1.262 billion increase in investment portfolio assets as discussed below.

•

$104 million increase in premiums receivables and $29 million increase in deferred policy acquisition costs due to the higher premium volume.

•

$27 million increase in reinsurance recoverables is primarily due business growth and an increase in the recoverable related to the company’s USAIG pool
participation. As discussed under Reinsurance, Page 26, the company’s working reinsurance treaties are with highly rated and financially strong reinsurers and the
company has experienced no collection or aging problems with the property casualty or life reinsurance receivables. See USAIG Pool Participation, Page 44, for a
discussion of that reinsurance recoverable.

•

$36 million increase in separate accounts primarily due to market appreciation of assets held and reinvestment of income as discussed in Separate Accounts, Page 20.

Offsetting the increases were a $31 million decline in other assets due to the
elimination of a prepaid federal tax assets in 2003 and a $21 million decline
in cash.



Investment Portfolio

The market value of the company’s investments was $12.527 billion and $11.265
billion at year-end 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Insurance regulatory and statutory requirements designed to protect
policyholders from investment risk influence the company’s investment decisions
on an individual insurance company basis. Cash generated from insurance
operations is invested almost entirely in five classes of assets evaluated for
yield and risk prior to purchase (See Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 7, for
a discussion of the five classes of assets).

The company invests primarily in publicly traded fixed-income and equity and
equity-linked securities, classified as available for sale in the accompanying
financial statements. Valuations of all of the company’s investments are based
on either listed prices or data provided by FT Interactive Data, an outside
resource that supplies global securities pricing. Changes in the fair value of
these securities, based on the listed prices or information from FT Interactive
Data, are reported on the company’s balance sheet in other comprehensive
income, net of tax. Fixed maturities (bonds and notes) and equity and
equity-linked securities (common and preferred stocks) are classified as
available for sale and recorded at fair value in the financial statements.

At December 31, 2003, the company’s portfolio of fixed-income securities had a
weighted average yield-to-book value of 6.5 percent,
a weighted average maturity of 10.2 years and a weighted average modified
duration of 5.0 years. At December 31, 2002, the company’s portfolio of
fixed-income securities had a weighted average yield-to-book of 7.4 percent, a
weighted average maturity of 10.6 years and a weighted average modified
duration of 4.9 years. The decline in the yield-to-book was due to lower
prevailing interest rates and the reinvestment of funds from calls or
redemptions at lower rates. Management is attempting to maintain an
intermediate portfolio duration to protect against the anticipated rise in
interest rates as the economy continues to improve. Duration can be defined as
the average maturity of all bond payments, where each payment is weighted by
its value. In the fixed-income market, duration is used to measure the
sensitivity of an asset price to movements in yields. See Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements,
Page 62, for additional information regarding the maturity of the company’s
fixed-income portfolio.

Over the past year, the company has invested a higher portion of available
funds in U.S. agency paper and insured municipal bonds, resulting in a
significant rise in the percentage of the portfolio rated A and above based on
fair value (market value). Credit ratings as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, for
the company’s fixed income portfolio were:

Similar to the equity portfolio, the fixed-income portfolio is concentrated in
the financials sector, including banks, brokerage, finance and investment and
insurance companies. Management leverages its familiarity with this sector in
its fixed-income portfolio. The financials sector represented 15.6 and 15.9
percent of both the book value and market value, respectively, of the overall
fixed-income portfolio at December 31, 2003. Approximately 95 of the financials
sector holdings are investment-grade corporate bonds. No other industry
accounts for more than 10 percent of the fixed-income portfolio.

USAIG Pool Participation

In 2003, $324 million, or 52.3 percent of total reinsurance receivables,
compared with $311 million in 2002, related to the company’s participation in
USAIG, a joint underwriting association of individual insurance companies that
collectively function as a worldwide



insurance market for all types of aviation
and aerospace accounts. Due to the company’s participation in USAIG for policy
years 2001 and prior, The Cincinnati Insurance Company was named as the
designated insurer for American Airlines’ policy year 2000 business.
Recoverables resulting from all American Airlines accidents during that year
were recorded on The Cincinnati Insurance Companies’ 2001 financial statements.
Management expects to recover 100 percent of the reinsurance recoverables
associated with the USAIG participation although it is impossible to estimate
the timeframe for recovery due to the complex nature of aviation and aerospace
insurance. USAIG has a reinsurance program for its members. Companies
participating in the USAIG reinsurance program are all rated A or higher by
A.M. Best. Reinsurance recoverables on behalf of unauthorized reinsurers
participating in the pool are backed by letters of credit and trust funds from
these reinsurers. The company no longer participates in USAIG.

Liabilities

Overview

At December 31, 2003, insurance reserves were 47.7 percent of total
liabilities. The remainder consisted primarily of unearned premiums (15.5
percent), deferred income tax (20.9 percent) and long- and short-term debt (6.5
percent). These percentages have remained relatively constant over a number of
years.

Total liabilities increased 9.2 percent, or $781 million, to $9.305 billion at
December 31, 2003 from December 31, 2002. The increase primarily reflected:

•

$347 million increase in insurance reserves as discussed in Item 1, Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Reserves, Page 3; Property Casualty Insurance Loss Reserves, Page
18; and Life Insurance Policy Reserves, Page 20, as well as Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Reserves, Page 25. The company does not discount its property casualty
reserves.

•

$127 million increase in unearned premiums due to higher premium volume.

•

$212 million increase in deferred income tax liability to $1.949 billion at December 31, 2003, primarily because of the increase in unrealized gains in the investment portfolio.

Long- and Short-term Debt

At December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2002, long-term debt consisted entirely
of $420 million in senior debentures. The senior debenture is not encumbered by
rating triggers. The company’s excellent cash flow and strong capital position
have allowed it to minimize its reliance on debt financing although the company
utilizes lines of credit to fund short-term cash needs.

The company has two lines of credit totaling $250 million at year-end 2003.
There are two financial covenants for the company’s
$175 million line of credit. First, consolidated net worth on the last day of
each fiscal quarter shall not be less than $5.0 billion or
$4.5 billion if such reduction in consolidated net worth is due solely to
unrealized losses in the company’s portfolio of debt and equity investments; at
year-end 2003, the company’s consolidated net worth was $6.204 billion. Second,
the company’s consolidated ratio of indebtedness for borrowed money to net
worth, at any time during each fiscal quarter, shall not exceed the ratio of
0.25-to-1.00; as of year-end 2003, the ratio of indebtedness to net worth was
0.10-to-1.00. The company’s $75 million line of credit has no financial
covenants. Short-term interest rates will fluctuate. Every 100 basis point
increase in short-term rates will increase annual interest expense by $2
million, before-tax, based on the $183 million outstanding on the two lines of
credit at year-end 2003.

During 2001, CFC Investment Company entered into an interest-rate swap as a
cash hedge of variable interest payments for certain variable-rate debt
obligations ($31 million notional amount) to better match fixed rate lease
assets with liabilities having a fixed financing rate. Under this interest-rate
swap contract, the company agreed to pay a fixed rate of interest for a
seven-year period. The contract is considered to be a hedge against changes in
the amount of future cash flows associated with the related interest payments.
Accordingly, the related unrealized gain or loss on this contract is a
component of comprehensive income. The interest swap contract is reflected at
fair value in the company’s balance sheet. The unrealized loss at December 31,
2003 and 2002 was $3 million and $4 million, net of tax. The net effect of this
transaction was to fix the interest cost on the short-term loan.

The company had no off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2003.

Shareholders’ Equity

Total shareholders’ equity was 40.0 percent and 39.8 percent of total assets at
year-end 2003 and 2002.

As a long-term investor, the company has followed a buy-and-hold strategy for
more than 40 years. A significant amount of unrealized appreciation on equity
investments has been generated as a result of this policy. Unrealized
appreciation on equity investments, before deferred income taxes, was $6.037
billion and $5.509 billion at year-end 2003 and 2002, respectively. It
constituted 65.8 percent of total shareholders’ equity at year-end 2003.

Comprehensive Income

During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the company had
realized investment losses before taxes amounting to $122 million, $152 million
and $105 million, offset by realized investment gains of $81 million, $58
million and $80 million, respectively. At December 31, 2003, unrealized
investment gains before taxes totaled $6.322 billion and unrealized investment
losses in the investment portfolio amounted to $29 million. The unrealized
appreciation was primarily due to the company’s holdings in Fifth Third
(Nasdaq: FITB) and Alltel Corporation (NYSE:AT) common stock.



Item 7(a). Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Introduction

Market risk is the potential for a decrease in value resulting from broad yet
uncontrollable forces such as: inflation, economic growth, interest rates,
world political conditions or other widespread unpredictable events. It is
comprised of many individual risks that, when combined, create a macroeconomic
impact. Some of the risks are:

•

Political – the potential for a decrease in market value due to the real or perceived impact of governmental policies or conditions

•

Regulatory – the potential for a decrease in market value due to the impact of legislative proposals or changes in the laws or regulations

•

Economic – the potential for a decrease in value due to changes in general economic factors (recession, inflation, deflation, etc.)

•

Revaluation – the potential for a decrease in market value due to a change in relative value (change in market multiple) of the market brought on by general economic factors

•

Interest-rate – the potential for a decrease in market value of a security or portfolio due to its sensitivity to changes (increases or decreases) in the general level of interest rates

Company-specific risk is the potential for a particular issuer to experience a decline in valuation due to the impact of sector or market risk on the holding
or because of issues specific to the firm:

•

Fraud – the potential for a negative impact on an issuer’s performance due to actual or alleged illegal or improper activity of individuals it employs

•

Credit – the potential for deterioration in an issuer’s financial profile due to specific company issues, problems it faces in the course of its operations or industry-related issues

•

Default – the possibility that an issuer will not make a required payment (interest payment or return of principal) on its debt. Generally this occurs after its financial profile has
deteriorated (credit risk) and it no longer has the means to make its payments

The investment committee of the board of directors monitors the investment risk
management process primarily through its executive oversight of investment
activities. The company takes an active approach to managing market and other
investment risks, including the accountabilities and controls over these
activities. Actively managing these market risks is integral to the company’s
operations and could require a change in the character of future investments
purchased or sold or require a shift in the existing asset portfolios to manage
exposure to market risk within acceptable ranges. The approach is applied daily
by the company’s portfolio managers and analysts to each of the five asset
classes in which the company invests.

Sector risk is the potential for a negative impact on a particular industry due
to its sensitivity to factors that make up market risk. Market risk affects
general supply/demand factors for an industry and will affect companies within
that industry to varying degrees.

Fixed-Income Securities

For investment-grade corporate bonds, the inverse relationship between interest
rates and bond prices leads to falling bond values during periods of increasing
interest rates. Although the potential for a worsening financial condition, and
ultimately default, does exist with investment-grade corporate bonds, their
higher-quality financial profiles make credit risk less of a concern than for
lower-quality investments. The company addresses this risk by consistently
investing within a particular maturity range, which has, over the years,
provided the portfolio with a laddered maturity schedule less subject to large
swings in value due to interest rate changes. While a single maturity range may
see values drop due to general interest rate levels, other maturity ranges will
be less affected by those changes. Additionally, purchases are spread across a
wide spectrum of industries and companies, diversifying the company’s holdings
and minimizing the impact of specific industries or companies with greater
sensitivities to interest rate fluctuations.



The primary risk related to high-yield corporate bonds is credit risk or the
potential for a deteriorating financial structure. A weak financial profile can
lead to rating downgrades from the credit rating agencies, which can put
further downward pressure on bond prices. Interest rate risk is less of a
factor with high-yield corporate bonds, as valuation is related more directly
to underlying operating performance than to general interest rates. This puts
more emphasis on the financial results achieved by the issuer rather than
general economic trends or statistics within the marketplace. The company
addresses this concern by analyzing issuer- and industry-specific financial
results and by closely monitoring holdings within this asset class.

The primary risks related to tax-exempt bonds are interest rate risk and
geo-political risk associated with the specific economic environment within the
political boundaries of the issuing municipal entity. The company addresses
these concerns by focusing on municipalities’ general-obligation debt and on
essential-service bonds. Essential-service bonds derive a revenue stream from
the services provided by the municipality, which are vital to the people living
in the area (schools, water service, sewer service, etc.). Another risk related
to tax-exempt bonds is regulatory risk or the potential for legislative changes
that would negate the benefit of owning tax-exempt bonds. The company monitors
regulatory activity for situations that may negatively affect current holdings
and its ongoing strategy for investing in these securities.

The final, less significant risk is a small exposure to credit risk for a
portion of the tax-exempt portfolio that has support from corporate entities.
Examples are bonds insured by corporate bond insurers or bonds with interest
payments made by a corporate entity through a municipal conduit/authority.
While decisions regarding these investments primarily consider the underlying
municipal situation, the existence of third-party insurance reduces risk in the
event of default. In circumstances in which the municipality was unable to meet
its obligations, risk would be increased if the insuring entity were
experiencing financial duress. Because of the company’s diverse exposure and
selection of higher-rated entities with strong financial profiles, the company
does not believe this is a material concern.

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis

The company is using a dynamic financial planning model developed during 2002
to further incorporate analytical tools in assessing market risks. Management
believes the model is improving the company’s ability to measure the impact on
bond values resulting from changes in interest rates. Improved measurement of
the impact of interest rate changes should allow for improved matching of the
company’s assets and liabilities.

Hypothetically, an increase in interest rates (market yields to maturity) of
100 basis points at December 31, 2003, would decrease the fair value of the
fixed-income portfolio by approximately 5.0 percent or $195 million, or to
$3.730 billion from $3.925 billion. Investment-grade corporate bonds have the
greatest sensitivity to interest rate changes. Based on the present duration of
the investment-grade corporate bond portfolio, a 100 basis point increase in
interest rates would result in a 5.5 percent decline in the fair value of that
portion of the portfolio. This would be offset by the callable agency paper,
which has higher coupons and, therefore, lower duration effects. The tax-exempt
municipal bond portfolio, with a longer average maturity schedule, would be
somewhat less sensitive to interest rate increases, while the high-yield
corporate bond portfolio would be even less sensitive.

Because of the company’s large surplus, long-term investment horizon and its
ability to hold most fixed-income investments until maturity, management
believes the company is well positioned for a rise in interest rates. A higher
rate environment would provide the opportunity to reinvest cash flow in higher
yielding securities. The potential decline in fair values due to an interest
rate increase would not signal a decline in credit quality. Management believes
that lower values due solely to interest rate changes would not signal the
likelihood of additional other-than-temporary impairments.

In the dynamic financial planning model, the selected interest rate change of
100 basis points represents management’s views of a shift in rates that is
quite possible over a one-year period. The rates modeled should not be
considered a prediction of future events as interest rates may be much more
volatile in the future. The analysis is not intended to provide a precise
forecast of the effect of changes in rates on the company’s results or
financial condition, nor does it take into account any actions that might be
taken to reduce exposure to such risks.

Equity and Equity-linked Securities

Common stocks are subject to a variety of risk factors encompassed under the
umbrella of market risk. General economic swings influence the performance of
the underlying industries and companies within those industries. A downturn in
the economy will have a negative impact on an equity portfolio. Industry- and
company-specific risks have the potential to substantially affect the market
value of the company’s equity portfolio. The company addresses these risks by
maintaining investments in a small group of holdings that management can
analyze closely, better understanding their business and the related risk
factors.

At December 31, 2003, the company held 15 individual equity positions valued at
approximately $100 million or above, see
Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 7, for additional details on these holdings.
These equity positions accounted for approximately
95 percent of the after-tax net unrealized appreciation of the entire
portfolio.

Management believes the company’s equity investment style – centered on
companies that pay and increase dividends to shareholders – is an appropriate
long-term strategy. While the company’s long-term financial position would be
affected by changes in the market valuation of its investments, management
believes the company’s strong surplus position and healthy cash flow provides
it with a cushion against short-term fluctuations in valuation. The continued
payment of cash dividends by the company’s common equities also provides a
floor to their valuation. Management is cognizant that a prolonged downturn in
the stocks of financial institutions would create the greatest long-term
negative effect on the portfolio.

While past performance cannot guarantee future returns, over the longer-term,
the performance of the company’s equity portfolio has exceeded that of the
broader market with a five-year total return of 23.7 percent compared with a
decline of 2.8 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, a common benchmark
of market performance. In 2003, the equity portfolio underperformed the market
with a total return of 9.3 percent compared with the Standard & Poor’s 500’s
return of 28.7 percent. The primary reason for the



difference was the
technology-led nature of the 2003 market rally, a market sector in which the
company has virtually no holdings. Financial institution and healthcare and
pharmaceutical-related issue indices generated returns more in line with the
performance of the company’s portfolio.

Fifth Third’s value in 2003 was affected by uncertainty surrounding a
regulatory review announced in late 2002. Some of the uncertainty was removed
when Fifth Third entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank
and the Ohio Department of Commerce in late March 2003. In the agreement, Fifth
Third outlined the series of steps its management has been taking to strengthen
identified areas. At that time, Fifth Third noted that management is extremely
serious about risk management and internal controls and that the company is
taking the necessary steps to strengthen procedures to fully cooperate with the
regulatory agencies. Fifth Third stated that these efforts, many of which had
already begun, will result in Fifth Third emerging from this process as an even
stronger company. Fifth Third continues to report results that meet Cincinnati
Financial’s investing criteria of increasing sales, earnings and dividends. In
addition, Cincinnati Financial management believes Fifth Third has proven
management and a favorable outlook.

The company held 72.8 million shares of Fifth Third common stock at a cost of
$283 million at December 31, 2003. The market value of the company’s Fifth
Third position was $4.301 billion at year-end 2003, or 52.7 percent of the
company’s total common equity portfolio, compared with $4.261 billion, or 54.0
percent, at year-end 2002. The after-tax unrealized gain represented by the
company’s Fifth Third position was $2.612 billion, or 63.8 percent of the
company’s total after-tax unrealized gains at year-end 2003, compared with
$2.586 billion, or 71.0 percent, at year-end 2002. The Fifth Third position
represented $16.28 of the company’s total book value of $38.69 per share at
year-end 2003 compared with $16.00 of year-end 2002 book value of $34.65. Every
$1.00 change in the market price of Fifth Third’s common stock has
approximately a 29-cent impact on Cincinnati Financial’s book value per share.
A 20 percent ($11.82) change in the market price of Fifth Third’s common stock,
which was $59.10 at year-end 2003, would result in a $860 million change in
assets and a $559 million change in after-tax unrealized gains. This would
affect shareholders’ equity by 9.0 percent and book value by $3.49 per share.

The primary risk related to convertible securities is similar to other
corporate fixed-income securities in terms of their sensitivity to interest
rates, credit risk and default risk. The better the financial condition of the
underlying issuer, the lower the credit risk. However, the pricing of
convertible securities is more likely to be driven by the relationship of the
underlying common stock price to the strike price of the embedded option. If
the underlying stock price is well below the strike price, the convertible
security will trade more like a pure fixed-income instrument and be more
interest rate sensitive. However, as the underlying stock approaches the option
strike price, the convertible will be less interest rate sensitive and more
responsive to movements in the stock.

Potential Impairments

Management monitors securities trading below 70 percent of book value for
potential other-than-temporary impairment in line with its asset impairment
policy discussed in Asset Impairment, Page 19. The reduction in the number of
securities trading below 100 percent of book value at year-end 2003 compared
with year-end 2002 reflected the recent emphasis on increasing the credit
quality of
the bond portfolio, as rated by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, as well as the
downward shift in the yield curve and compression of the spread with treasury
bonds. Further, during 2003 and 2002, 49 and 30 securities, respectively, were
written down as other-than-temporarily impaired.

The asset impairment policy evaluates: significant decreases in the market
value of the assets; changes in legal factors or in the business climate; or
other such factors indicating whether or not the carrying amount may be
recoverable. A declining trend in market value, the extent of the market value
decline and the length of time in which the value has been depressed are
objective measures that can be outweighed by subjective measures such as
impending events and issuer liquidity. Impairment is evaluated in the event of
a declining market value for four consecutive quarters with quarter-end market
value below 50 percent of book value or a market value 50 percent below book
value for three consecutive quarters. In addition to applying the impairment
policy, the status of the portfolio is constantly monitored by the company’s
portfolio managers for indications of potential problems or issues that may be
possible impairment issues. If a significant impairment indicator is noted, the
portfolio managers even more closely scrutinize the security.

As a result of the application of the impairment policy, there are just two
securities with a combined book value of $70 thousand trading below 70 percent
of book value at year-end 2003, compared with 59 securities with a market value
of $139 million and a book value of $231 million, or 2.0 percent of total
invested assets, at year-end 2002. As discussed in Asset Impairment, Page 19,
when evaluating other-than-temporary impairments, management considers the
company’s ability to retain a security for a period adequate to recover a
substantial portion of their cost. Because of the company’s investment
philosophy and strong capitalization, it can hold securities until their
scheduled redemption that might otherwise be deemed impaired as management
evaluates their potential for recovery based economic, industry or company
factors.

Management deems the risk related to securities trading between 70 percent and
100 percent of book value to be relatively minor and at least partially offset
by the earned income potential of these investments. At year-end 2003,
impairment to market value of all
116 securities trading in this range would have resulted in only $24 million in
additional realized investment losses, before tax. These 116 securities, which
represented 5.2 percent of the total market value of the portfolio, generated
$25 million, or 5.5 percent, of total earned investment income.

The two issues trading below 70 percent of book value at December 31, 2003, had
been at that level for 12 months or less. At December 31, 2003, no securities
in the company’s portfolio had traded below 70 percent of book value for more
than 12 months.

For all 116 securities trading at 70 percent to less than 100 percent of book
value, 51 securities representing $19 million in unrealized losses had been
trading in that range for more than 12 months; seven securities representing
less than $1 million in unrealized losses had been trading in that range for
more than six to 12 months; and 58 securities representing $5 million in
unrealized losses had been trading in that range for six months or less.

Of the total 118 holdings trading below book value at December 31, 2003, three
were common stocks and 11 were convertible securities representing total
unrealized losses of $7 million. Financials sector securities accounted for $6
million, or 25.4 percent, of the unrealized losses. At year-end, total
financials sector securities in the common equity portfolio had a market value
of $5.753 billion. The other $18 million in unrealized losses was spread across
a variety of industries.

Reflecting the company’s long-term investment philosophy, of the 1,286
securities trading at or above book value, 581, or 45.2 percent, have shown
unrealized gains for more than 24 months.

Based on current information, the company anticipates application of its policy
will result in other-than-temporary impairment charges less than $5 million in
the first quarter of 2004, barring new developments affecting individual
companies or industries in the portfolio.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Responsibility for Financial Statements

The accompanying financial statements of Cincinnati
Financial Corporation and
subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2003, were prepared by management
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAP).

The management of the company is responsible for
the integrity and objectivity
of the financial statements, which are presented on an accrual basis of
accounting and include amounts based upon management’s best estimates and
judgment. Other financial information in the Annual Report on Form 10-K is
consistent with that in the financial statements. The accounting system and
related internal controls are designed to assure that the books and records
reflect the transactions of the company in accordance with established policies
and procedures as implemented by qualified personnel.

The board of directors has established an audit
committee composed of outside
directors who are believed to be free from any relationship that could
interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as audit committee members.

The audit committee meets periodically with
management, the independent
auditors and the internal auditors to make inquiries as to the manner in which
the responsibilities of each are being discharged and reports thereon to the
board of directors. In addition, the audit committee recommends to the board of
directors the annual appointment of the independent auditors with whom the
audit committee reviews the scope of the audit assignment, adequacy of internal
controls and internal audit procedures.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent auditors,
have audited the financial
statements of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and subsidiaries for the year
ended December 31, 2003, and their report is included herein. The auditors meet
with members of the audit committee of the board of directors to discuss the
results of their examination and are afforded the opportunity to present their
opinions in the absence of management personnel with respect to the adequacy of
internal controls and the quality of financial reporting of the company.

Independent Auditors’ Report

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Cincinnati Financial Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Cincinnati
Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and
financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Cincinnati Financial Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Cincinnati Financial Corporation (company), through
four insurance companies,
markets insurance mainly through a network of local independent agents.
Insurance products include a broad range of business and personal policies, as
well as life and disability income insurance and annuities. In addition, the
company has finance/leasing and asset management operations through the CFC
Investment Company and CinFin Capital Management Company subsidiaries.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the company and
subsidiaries, each of which is wholly owned, and are presented in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAP). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Property Casualty Insurance

Expenses incurred in the issuance of policies are
deferred and amortized over
the terms of the policies. These expenses vary with and are primarily related
to acquiring insurance business, principally agents’ commissions, premium taxes
and certain underwriting costs. Anticipated investment income is not considered
in determining if a premium deficiency related to insurance contracts exists.
Policy premiums are deferred and earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of
the policies. The portion of written premiums applicable to the unexpired terms
of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums. Loss and loss expense
reserves are based on claims reported prior to the end of the year and
estimates of unreported claims net of estimates for salvage and subrogation
reserves, based upon facts in each claim and the company’s experience with
similar claims. The establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves
for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain process. Reserve estimates are
regularly reviewed and updated, using the most current information available.
Any resulting adjustments are reflected in current operations.

The Cincinnati Insurance Companies market property
casualty insurance policies
in 31 states. Nine states with at least $100 million in agency earned premium
in 2003 generated approximately 70 percent and 71 percent of total property
casualty premiums in 2003 and 2002. Ohio, where the company has 187 independent
agencies, accounted for 24.6 percent and 25.3 percent of total earned premiums
in 2003 and 2002. Agencies in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania each
contributed between 5 percent and 10 percent of premium volume in 2003 and
2002. No single agency accounted for more than 1.2 percent of the company’s
total agency direct earned premiums.

Life Insurance

Traditional products require the policyholder to
pay scheduled premiums over
the life of the coverage. The company recognizes premiums received on
traditional products as revenue when due.

Limited-pay products require the policyholder to
pay scheduled premiums up
front but coverage is provided for an extended period. Limited-pay products
include single premium deferred annuities or life insurance policies with a
limited premium paying period. The company defers the amount of premium in
excess of the amount necessary to provide for all benefits and expenses and
recognizes it over the life of the coverage using the gross profit method.

Universal life products include those that allow
policyholders to vary premiums
at their discretion or provide benefits or permit charges that are not fixed
according to the terms of the policy. Premiums for universal life products are
not recognized as revenue when received. The company recognizes cost of
insurance charges, administration charges and surrender charges as revenue when
earned using the gross profit method.

Reserves for traditional products are based on
expected expenses, mortality,
withdrawal rates and investment yields, including provision for adverse
deviation. Once these assumptions are established, they generally are
maintained throughout the lives of the contracts. Expected mortality is derived
primarily from industry experience and withdrawal rates are based on company
and industry experience, while investment yield is based on company experience
and the economic conditions then in effect.

Reserves for universal life products are equal to
the cumulative account
balances, which include premium deposits plus credited interest, less charges
such as mortality and administration, and withdrawals. Interest rates on
approximately $530 million and $480 million of such reserves at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are
periodically adjusted subject to economic conditions then in effect and subject
to contractually guaranteed minimum rates.

Expenses incurred in the issuance of traditional
life insurance products, which
include whole life and term life insurance contracts, are deferred and
amortized as premiums are earned. Expenses incurred in the issuance of
interest-sensitive products are deferred and amortized using the gross profit
method, adjusted for emerging experience and expected trends.



Accident Health Insurance

Expenses incurred in the issuance of policies are
deferred and amortized in
level proportion to earned premiums over the contract term. Policy premium
income, unearned premiums and reserves for unpaid losses are accounted for in
substantially the same manner as property casualty insurance items discussed
above.

Lease/Finance

CFC Investment Company provides auto and equipment
direct financing (leases and
loans) to commercial and individual clients. Generally, lease contracts
transfer ownership of the property to the lessees at the end of the lease terms
and contain bargain purchase options. Income is recognized over the financing
term using the interest method.

Identified initial direct costs associated with the
origination of a lease or
loan are capitalized and amortized, using the interest method, over the life of
the financing. These costs include, but are not limited to: finder fees, broker
fees, filing fees and the cost of credit reports.

Asset Management

Billings are based on a fee structure calculated
upon the market values of the
assets at the end of the period. Revenues are recognized as fees are earned. As
of December 31, 2003, CinFin Capital had 53 institutional, corporate and
individual clients and
$762 million under management, compared with 35 clients and $726 million at
December 31, 2002.

Reinsurance

In the normal course of business, the company seeks
to reduce losses that may
arise from catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting
results by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with
other insurance companies and reinsurers. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve
the company from any obligation to policyholders. Although the company
historically has not experienced uncollectible reinsurance recoverables,
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the
company. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner
consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy.

The company also assumes some reinsurance from
other insurance companies,
reinsurers and involuntary state pools. Such assumed reinsurance activity is
recorded principally on the basis of reports received from the ceding
companies.

Investments

Fixed maturities (bonds and notes) and equity
securities (common and preferred
stocks) are classified as available for sale and are stated at fair values.

Unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of
taxes, are included in
shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains
and losses on investments are recognized in net income on a specific
identification basis.

Investment income consists primarily of interest
and dividends. Interest is
recognized on an accrual basis and dividends are recorded at the ex-dividend
date. The interest method is used for amortizing premiums and discounts on
fixed-maturity securities.

Other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of
investments are recognized
in net income as realized investment losses at the time when facts and
circumstances indicate such write-downs are warranted.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
Activities

The company invests in certain financial
instruments that contain embedded
options such as convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. The embedded
options are valued and accounted for separately. The company also entered into
an interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge during 2001 in order to
lock in an interest rate related to certain of its variable rate debt
obligations ($31 million notional amount). Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” as amended requires changes in the fair value of the
company’s derivative financial instruments to be recognized periodically in
income or shareholders’ equity (as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income), respectively. Neither the adoption of SFAS No. 133 nor
any subsequent changes in fair values of these instruments have had a
significant impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Disclosures

Fair values for investments in equity and
fixed-maturity securities (including
redeemable preferred stock and assets held in separate accounts) are based on
either quoted market prices or data provided by an outside resource that
supplies global securities pricing.

The fair values for liabilities under
investment-type insurance contracts
(annuities) are estimated using discounted cash flow calculations, based on
interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities
consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. Fair values for
short-term notes payable are estimated using interest rates currently available
to the company. Fair values for long-term debentures are based on the quoted
market prices for such debentures. Fair value of the interest rate swap is
determined by a bank.



Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost less
accumulated depreciation and
amortization. The company provides depreciation and amortization based on
estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated methods.
Depreciation and amortization expense recorded in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $30
million, $22 million and $25 million, respectively. The company reviews
property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances, such as significant decreases in market values of assets,
changes in legal factors or in the business climate, an accumulation of costs
significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or
construct an asset, or other such factors indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable.

The company capitalizes costs related to computer
software developed internally

during the application development stage of software development projects.
These costs generally consist of certain external, payroll and payroll-related
costs

.

During 2000, the company wrote off $39 million of previously capitalized
costs related to the development of next-generation software to process
property casualty policies. Management conducted a review of the project,
including an assessment by an independent firm, and determined, after several
deliverable dates were missed, that the project design would not perform as
originally intended. The decision required that the application software under
development be abandoned and a new application purchased. As a result of a
settlement negotiated with a vendor, third quarter 2003 pretax results included
the recovery of $23 million of the $39 million charge. This settlement was
included in other operating expenses.

Federal Income Taxes

Deferred income tax liabilities and assets are
computed using the tax rates in
effect for the time when temporary differences in book and taxable income are
estimated to reverse. Deferred income taxes are recognized for numerous
temporary differences between the company’s taxable income and book-basis
income and other changes in shareholders’ equity. Such temporary differences
relate primarily to unrealized gains on investments and differences in the
recognition of deferred acquisition costs and insurance reserves. Deferred
income taxes associated with unrealized appreciation (except the amounts
related to the effect of income tax rate changes) are charged to shareholders’
equity in accumulated other comprehensive income, and deferred taxes associated
with other differences are charged to income.

Separate Accounts

The company issues life contracts with guaranteed
minimum returns, referred to
as bank-owned life insurance policies, the assets and liabilities of which are
legally segregated and recorded as assets and liabilities of the separate
accounts. Minimum investment returns and account values are guaranteed by the
company and also include death benefits to beneficiaries of the contract
holders.

The assets of the separate accounts are carried at
fair value. Separate account
liabilities primarily represent the contract holders’ claims to the related
assets and are carried at the fair value of the assets. In the event that the
asset value of contract holders’ accounts is projected below the value
guaranteed by the company, a liability is established through a charge to the
company’s earnings. Generally, investment income and realized investment gains
and losses of the separate accounts accrue directly to the contract holders
and, therefore, are not included in the company’s Consolidated Statements of
Income; however, each separate account contract includes a negotiated realized
gain and loss sharing arrangement with the company. A percentage of each
separate account’s realized gain and loss accrues to the company and is
transferred from the separate account to the company’s general account and is
recognized as revenue or expense. Revenues and expenses for the company related
to the separate accounts also consist of contractual fees and mortality,
surrender and expense risk charges.

Earnings per Share

Net income per common share is based on the
weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during each of the respective years. The calculation of net
income per common share (diluted) assumes the conversion of convertible senior
debentures and the exercise of stock options.



Stock Options

The company has qualified and non-qualified stock
option plans under which
options are granted to employees at prices which are not less than market price
at the date of grant and which are exercisable over 10-year periods. The
company applies Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for these plans. Accordingly, no compensation
cost has been recognized for the stock option plans.

Had compensation cost for the company’s stock
option plans been determined
based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans
consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” the company’s net income and earnings per share would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

In determining the pro forma amounts above, the
fair value of each option was
estimated on the date of grant using the binomial option-pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively: dividend yield of 2.40 percent, 2.52 percent and 2.20 percent;
expected volatility of 26.03 percent, 25.90 percent and 25.54 percent;
risk-free interest rates of 4.20 percent, 4.26 percent and 5.54 percent; and
expected lives of 10 years for all years. Compensation expense in the pro forma
disclosures is not indicative of future amounts as options vest over several
years and additional grants generally are made each year.

New Accounting Pronouncements

The Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 149 “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” in April 2003 to amend and clarify
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging
activities under SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after
June 30, 2003. This statement did not have any effect on the company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In May 2003, FASB issued SFAS No. 150
“Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150
establishes standards for how an issuer of financial instruments classifies and
measures in its statement of financial position certain instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 affects an
issuer’s accounting for various types of financial instruments that are
required to be accounted for as liabilities. SFAS No. 150 is effective for all
financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. For all
financial instruments entered into prior to May 31, 2003, SFAS 150 is effective
at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003,
which for the company begins July 1, 2003. The company does not have any
financial instruments outstanding to which the provisions of SFAS No. 150
apply; therefore, the adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have any impact on the
company’s consolidated financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46)
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and Interpretation of ARB No.
51,” which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest
entities (VIEs) either that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to
permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support, or in which the equity investors lack an essential
characteristic of a controlling financial interest. In December 2003, the FASB
completed deliberations of proposed modifications to FIN 46 (Revised
Interpretations) resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as
well as the creation date of the VIE. Management has determined that the
adoption of this standard will have no material impact on the consolidated
financial statements.

The Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued
Statement of Position 03-1
“Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional
Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts,” in July 2003 to be
effective for the company in the first quarter of 2004. This Statement of
Position provides guidance for insurance companies for certain nontraditional
long-duration contracts (principally variable annuities with minimum death
benefit guarantees) and for separate accounts. Management has determined that
this statement will have no effect on the company’s consolidated financial
statements.

At December 31, 2003, 40 fixed maturity
investments with a total unrealized
loss of $12 million and 11 equity securities with a total unrealized loss of $7
million had been in that position for 12 months or more. All were trading
between 70 percent to less than 100 percent of book value. These assets
presently do not meet the company’s other-than-temporary asset impairment
criteria and will not be impaired unless they do so in the future.



During 2003, lingering weakness in certain sectors
of the economy, such as
basic manufacturing, led to continued price weakness for related equity
securities. These economic factors as well as company-specific problems
contributed to the continued price weakness for the fixed maturity securities.
In addition, utility/merchant energy/trading and airline bonds that remain in
the portfolio continue to trade below book value because of industrywide
performance concerns.

As a result of changes in estimates of insured
events in prior years, the
provision for losses and loss expenses decreased by $80 million, $45 million
and $62 million in calendar years 2003, 2002 and 2001. These decreases are due
in part to the effects of settling reported (case) and unreported (IBNR)
reserves established in prior years for less than expected.

The reserve for loss and loss expenses in the
accompanying balance sheets also
includes $29 million, $26 million and $22 million at December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively, for certain life health losses.



5. Life Policy Reserves

Life policy reserves have been calculated using the
account value basis for
universal life and annuity policies and modifications of the 1975-80 select and
ultimate table for traditional policies. Life policy reserves are summarized as
follows:

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair value
associated with the annuities
shown above approximated $412 million and $331 million, respectively.

6. Notes Payable

The company and subsidiaries had no compensating
balance requirement on debt
for either 2003 or 2002. The company had two lines of credit with commercial
banks amounting to $250 million in 2003 (expiring in 2004) and $250 million in
2002, of which $183 million was in use at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Interest
rates charged on such borrowings ranged from 1.56 percent to 8.49 percent
during 2003, which resulted in an average interest rate of 2.57 percent. At
December 31, 2003, the fair value of the notes payable approximated the
carrying value and the weighted average interest rate approximated 2.43
percent.

The company entered an interest-rate swap agreement
during 2001, which expires
in 2008, to hedge future cash flows (thereby obtaining a fixed interest rate)
related to certain variable rate debt obligations ($31 million notional
amount). This swap is reflected at fair value in the accompanying balance sheet
and the $2 million unrealized loss, net of tax, at December 31, 2003, is a
component of comprehensive income; the fair value was $2 million, net of tax,
at December 31, 2002. The company does not expect any significant amounts to be
reclassified into earnings as a result of interest rate changes in the next 12
months.

7. Senior Debentures

The company issued $420 million of senior
debentures due 2028 in 1998. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair value of the debentures approximated $458

million and $429 million, respectively. The company had convertible senior
debentures which matured in 2002 and were convertible into shares of common
stock at a conversion price of $14.88 per share (or 67.23 shares for each one
thousand dollars principal).

8. Shareholders’ Equity and Dividend Restrictions

CFC’s insurance subsidiary paid cash dividends
to the company of $50 million in
2003 and $100 million in both 2002 and 2001. Dividends paid by insurance
subsidiaries are restricted by regulatory requirements of the insurance
subsidiaries’ domiciliary state. Generally, the maximum dividend that may be
paid without prior regulatory approval is limited to the greater of
10 percent of statutory surplus or 100 percent of statutory net income for the
prior calendar year, up to the amount of statutory unassigned surplus as of the
end of the prior calendar year. Dividends exceeding these limitations may be
paid only with approval of the insurance department of the subsidiaries’
domiciliary state. During 2004, the total dividends that may be paid to the
company without regulatory approval are approximately $278 million.

The company’s board of directors has
authorized the repurchase of outstanding
shares. The company has purchased 15.8 million shares at a cost of $520 million
between the inception of the share repurchase program in 1996 and December 31,
2003.
At December 31, 2003, 5.3 million shares remain authorized for repurchase at
any time in the future.

As of December 31, 2003, 5 million shares
of common stock were available for
future stock option grants.

Declared cash dividends per share were $1.00, 89
cents and 84 cents for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The provision for federal income taxes is based
upon a consolidated income tax
return for the company and subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2003, the company
has capital loss carryforwards of $91 million that expire in 2007 and 2008.
Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than
not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on the assumption that
certain levels of income will be achieved.

and the company’s effective
federal income tax rates are as follows:

No provision was made December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001 for federal income taxes
on approximately $14 million of the life insurance subsidiary’s retained
earnings, since such taxes will become payable only to the extent that such
retained earnings are distributed as dividends or exceed limitations prescribed
by tax laws. The company does not contemplate any such dividend.

11. Net Income Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed based on the
weighted average number of
shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the
weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares
outstanding.

For the company, dilutive potential common shares
consist of outstanding stock
options and shares issuable under the matured
5.5 percent convertible senior debentures (debentures). The computations of
basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:

included in the computation of net income per common share (diluted) because
the options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the
common shares.



12. Pension Plan

The company and subsidiaries sponsor a defined
contribution plan (401(k)
savings plan) and a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all
employees. Benefits for the defined benefit plan are based on years of credited
service and compensation level. Contributions to the plan are based on the
frozen entry age actuarial cost method. Pension expense is composed of several
components that are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial cost
method and based on certain actuarial assumptions.

The following table sets forth summarized
information on the company’s defined
benefit pension plan:

The company uses a December 31 measurement
date for its plans. The accumulated
benefit obligation was $117 million and
$93 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The fair value of the
company’s stock comprised $24 million (18 percent of total plan assets) at
December 31, 2003, and $22 million (18 percent of total plan assets) at
December 31, 2002.

The company evaluates and updates pension plan
assumptions annually as
necessary. The discount rate assumptions for the benefit obligation tracks with
and yearly adjustments reflect changes in Moody’s Aa bond yields. The rate of
compensation increase assumptions reflect historical calendar year compensation
increases.

14. Transactions with Affiliated Parties

The company paid certain officers and directors, or
insurance agencies of which
they are shareholders, commissions of approximately $19 million, $17 million
and $14 million on premium volume of approximately $132 million, $113 million
and $95 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

15. Contingencies

Various litigation and claims against the company
and its subsidiaries are in
process and pending resulting from normal insurance and non-insurance
activities. Based upon a review of open matters with legal counsel, management
believes that the outcomes of normal insurance matters will not have a material
effect upon the company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations and the outcomes of non-insurance matters will be covered by
external insurance coverage.

17. Segment Information

The company is organized and operates primarily in
two industries, property
casualty insurance and life insurance, and has four reportable segments -
commercial lines property casualty insurance, personal lines property casualty
insurance, life insurance and investment operations — which company management
regularly reviews to make decisions about allocating resources to the segments
and assessing their performance. Included in the other category below are
operations of the parent company, CFC Investment Company and CinFin Capital
Management Company (excluding investment activities) and other income of the
insurance subsidiaries.

Revenue is primarily from unaffiliated customers.
Insurance segments’ revenues
are insurance premiums earned; investment operations’ revenue represents net
investment income and realized investment gains and losses; and other revenue
is primarily finance/lease income and other income of the insurance
subsidiaries.

Income before income taxes for the insurance
segments represents underwriting
profit (loss), which is defined as premiums earned minus loss and loss expenses
incurred or policyholder benefits, and underwriting expenses.

Income before income taxes for the investment
operations represents net
investment income plus realized investment gains and losses, less interest
credited to contract holders. Other losses before income taxes of $38 million,
$32 million and $37 million recorded in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, were
primarily due to interest expense from debt of the parent company and operating
expenses of the company’s headquarters.

Identifiable assets by segment are those assets
used in the respective
segment’s operations. Information regarding identifiable assets is not reported
for two reportable segments — commercial lines and personal lines of property
casualty insurance — because these amounts are not used by company management
for analysis of those segments. All fixed-maturity and equity security
investments, regardless of ownership, are included in the investment operations
segment.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial
Disclosure

There were no disagreements on accounting and
financial disclosure requirements
with the independent audit firm in the 24 months prior to December 31, 2003.

Item 9(a). Controls and Procedures

In 2002, in response to legislation and proposed
regulations, management
reviewed its internal control structure and its disclosure controls and
procedures. While management believed the pre-existing disclosure controls and
procedures were adequate to enable the company to comply with its disclosure
obligations, management implemented minor changes as a result of such review,
primarily to formalize and document procedures already in place.

The company’s disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that
material information relating to the company and its subsidiaries required to
be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The company has a disclosure
committee that consists of certain members of the company’s senior management.

An evaluation was carried out under the supervision
and with the participation
of management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, to determine the effectiveness of the design and operation of
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that Cincinnati
Financial Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December 31, 2003.

The chief executive officer and chief financial
officer also have concluded
that in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, there
were no changes in the company’s internal controls that materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company’s internal controls
over financial reporting.
