                                  INTRODUCTION

     Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., a Delaware corporation formed
in 1987 ("FCX"), is a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Inc.  ("FTX"*).
FCX's principal operating subsidiary is P.T.  Freeport Indonesia Company
("PT-FI"), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
Republic of Indonesia and domesticated in Delaware.  PT-FI engages in the
exploration for and development, mining, and processing of copper, gold
and silver in Indonesia and in the marketing of concentrates containing
such metals worldwide.  FCX believes that PT-FI has one of the lowest
cost copper producing operations in the world, taking into account
customary credits for related gold and silver production.  FTX owns
approximately 69.77% of FCX's common stock.  FCX owns approximately 81.28%
of the outstanding common stock of PT-FI.  Of the remaining 18.72% of the
outstanding PT-FI common stock, approximately 9.36% is owned by the
Government of the Republic of Indonesia (the "Government") and approximately
9.36% is owned by an Indonesian corporation, P.T.  Indocopper Investama
Corporation ("PT-II"), in which FCX owns a 49% interest.  FCX also has
a subsidiary, Eastern Mining Company, Inc., ("Eastern Mining") which on April
29, 1993 was granted an exploration permit, giving it exclusive rights for a
limited period to explore for minerals on 2.5 million acres adjacent to
the 6.5 million acre exploration area covered by PT-FI's New
COW (as defined below).  On March 30, 1993, FCX acquired a 65%
interest in the capital stock of Rio Tinto Minera, S.A.  ("RTM"), a
company primarily engaged in the smelting and refining of copper
concentrates in Spain.  In December 1993, RTM redeemed the remaining 35%
interest.

- --------------------------
 *The  term "FTX", as used  in this report,  means Freeport-McMoRan Inc.,
its divisions, and its  direct and indirect subsidiaries and  affiliates other
than FCX, or any one  or more of them,  unless the context requires  Freeport-
McMoRan Inc. only.


      In January 1994,  FCX redeemed  its Zero Coupon  Exchangeable Notes  due
2011 (the "Notes").  Of the $118.6 million Notes outstanding at the initiation
of the  call, $118.3  million were  exchanged into 6.7  million shares  of FCX
Class A Common Stock  prior to the redemption of  the Notes.  The  balance was
redeemed for  cash.  Also  in January  1994, FCX sold  4.3 million  depositary
shares, each representing 0.05 shares of its Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock,
Series II to the public  for net proceeds of $158.5 million.   In August 1993,
FCX sold 6.0 million  depositary shares, each representing 0.05  shares of its
Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock,  to the  public for net  proceeds of  $220.4
million.    In  July 1993,  FCX  sold  14.0  million depositary  shares,  each
representing  0.05 shares of its  Step-Up Convertible Preferred  Stock, to the
public for net proceeds of $340.7 million.


                      P.T. FREEPORT INDONESIA COMPANY

     PT-FI's operations are located  in the rugged highlands of  the Sudirman
Mountain  Range in  the  province of  Irian  Jaya, Indonesia,  located  on the
western half of the island of New Guinea.   Over the last 25 years,  PT-FI has
met an extraordinary combination of engineering and construction challenges to
develop its mining and milling complex and supporting infrastructure in one of
the  least explored  areas  in the  world.   PT-FI's  largest mine,  Grasberg,
discovered in  1988, contains the largest  single gold reserve and  one of the
three largest open-pit  copper reserves of any mine in the world.  In order to
develop  the Grasberg deposit, PT-FI undertook an expansion program in stages,
initially from  20,000 metric tons  of ore  per day ("MTPD")  to 57,000  MTPD.
Expansion  from 57,000  MTPD to  66,000 MTPD  was completed  in 1993  ahead of
schedule and within budget.   PT-FI has begun  work on a further  expansion of
its  overall mining and milling  rate to 115,000 MTPD which  is expected to be
completed   by  year-end  1995  and  to  result  in  annual  production  rates
approaching 1.1 billion pounds of copper and 1.5 million ounces of gold.


                             CONTRACT OF WORK

     In 1967,  PT-FI's  predecessor,  Freeport  Indonesia,  Incorporated,  a
Delaware corporation,  ("FII")  and the Government  entered into a contract of
work  (the "1967 COW")  governing FII's mining activities  in Indonesia.  From
1967  until the  end of  1991, FII  operated as  the  sole contractor  for the
production and  marketing of  certain minerals  from a  24,700 acre area  (the
"1967  Mining Area").   On  December 30,  1991, FII was  merged into  PT-FI in
Delaware and PT-FI and the Government signed a  new contract of work (the "New
COW"), which superseded the 1967 COW.  The New COW covers both the 1967 Mining
Area and  a contiguous 6.5 million acre exploration area (the "New COW Area").
The  New COW has  a 30-year term,  with provisions for  two 10-year extensions
under certain conditions.

     The  New COW contains a  provision under which  PT-FI must progressively
relinquish  its rights  to the  nonprospective parts  of the  New COW  Area in
amounts  equal to 25%  of the 6.5  million acres at  the end of  each of three
specified periods, the first of which is  set to expire on December 30,  1994,
unless further extended by the Ministry of Mines, and the last of which is set
to expire five to  seven years after the signing of the New  COW.  In light
of these relinquishment provisions, PT-FI has implemented an active
exploration program with a focus on both what it believes to be the most
promising exploration opportunities in the New Cow Area as well as
identification of areas which appear to hold the least promise.
The New COW also  contains provisions  for PT-FI  to conduct  or cause
to be  conducted a feasibility study relating to  the construction of a
copper smelting facility in Indonesia and for the eventual construction of
such a facility by PT-FI, if such facility  is deemed to be
economically viable by PT-FI and the Government and is not
constructed by others.  PT-FI is pursuing with other companies the
feasibility  of constructing a copper smelting facility in Indonesia, in which
PT-FI would hold a minority interest and supply  approximately one-half of the
smelter's currently anticipated copper concentrate requirements.


                               ORE RESERVES

   Based upon published reports, FCX believes that PT-FI's Grasberg deposit
contains the largest single gold reserve and one of the three largest open-pit
copper reserves of any mine in the world.  Proved and probable ore reserves at
December 31, 1993 were approximately 1,074.1 million tons* at an average grade
of 1.31% copper,  1.47 grams of gold per ton  and 4.04 grams of silver per ton
compared with approximately 733.2 million tons of ore with an average grade of
1.47% copper, 1.72 grams of gold per ton  and 3.87 grams of silver per ton  at
December 31,  1992.  Primarily as a  result of the drilling  operations at the
Grasberg mine (see "Mines  in Production" below), PT-FI's proved  and probable
copper  and  gold reserves  as of  December 31,  1993  have increased,  net of
production   since  December  31,   1988  by  approximately   319%  and  574%,
respectively, and from year-end 1992 by 28% and 22%, respectively.

- --------------------------
*  As used  herein, "ton" refers to  a metric ton, which  is equivalent to
   2,204.62 pounds on a dry weight basis.

     This  increase  in proved  and  probable  reserves,  net of  production,
reflects  the  addition  of approximately  340.9  million  tons  of ore  since
December 31, 1992  (a 46% increase) as  the result of a  drilling program that
includes data obtained from the surface down to approximately  the 3,100 meter
elevation at the Grasberg ore  body.  PT-FI's proved and probable  reserves at
Grasberg do not include reserves below the 3,100 meter level.  PT-FI has begun
driving  an adit (the  "Amole adit") from the  mill site to  a point below the
currently delineated  Grasberg ore body at  the 2,900 meter level.   The Amole
adit,  expected  to  be  completed  in  1996,  will  facilitate  further  deep
exploration  to delineate the  extent of the Grasberg  deposit below the 3,100
meter  level.   Preliminary  drilling  from  the  existing  3,700  meter  adit
indicates significant additional mineralization  below the existing proved and
probable  reserves.    There  can  be  no  assurance,  however,  that  PT-FI's
exploration  programs will result in the delineation of additional reserves in
commercial  quantities.  For further  information with respect  to the copper,
gold  and  silver  content of  proved  and  probable  ore  reserves of  PT-FI,
reference is made to Note 11 to the financial statements of FCX referred to on
page  F-1 hereof  (the  "FCX Financial  Statements"),  incorporated herein  by
reference.


                             MINING OPERATIONS

Mines in Production

     PT-FI currently has two mines in operation: the Ertsberg East and the
Grasberg, both within the 1967 Mining Area.  PT-FI milled ore at an average
rate of approximately 57,600 MTPD in 1992 and 62,300 MTPD in 1993.

     Open pit mining of the Grasberg ore body commenced in January 1990.
In 1993, Grasberg mine output totaled approximately 19.8 million tons of
ore, providing approximately 81% of total PT-FI ore production.  Production
from the Grasberg ore body, averaged approximately 54,100 MTPD during 1993.

     Ertsberg East is an underground mine which commenced production in
1980.  Block caving operations are conducted in two separate zones of the
ore body with a common haulage level at 3,530 meters elevation.  In 1993,
mine output from Ertsberg East totaled approximately 4.4 million tons of
ore and provided approximately 18% of total PT-FI ore production.
Production from Ertsberg East averaged approximately 12,200 MTPD during
1993.  The Ertsberg East mine is expected to be depleted by the second half
of 1994 and production primarily from Grasberg, supplemented by production
from the Intermediate Ore Zone (the "IOZ") ore body (see "Mines in
Development" below), is expected to offset the Ertsberg East production.

Mines in Development

     Three major additions to PT-FI's underground mining operations, which
are intended to replace existing underground production areas when they
become depleted, have previously been developed: the DOM (from the Dutch
word meaning "cathedral") ore body, the Deep Ore Zone (the "DOZ") ore body
and the IOZ ore body.  The IOZ is located vertically between the Ertsberg
East and the DOZ ore bodies.

     The DOM ore body's initial working level is some 380 meters above the
Erstberg East mining operation.  The DOM ore body will initially be mined
using the block caving method.  Pre-production development is complete and
the first block cave area has been prepared.  All maintenance, warehouse
and service facilities are in place.  Production at the DOM has been
deferred as a result of the continued increase in the Grasberg ore
reserves.

     The mine being developed at the IOZ ore body is situated approximately
350 meters above the 2,900 meter level adit.  Delineation drilling and pre-
production development began in 1991.  The IOZ is being developed to
gradually replace production from the Ertsberg East mine beginning in 1994
using the same block caving method.  Mining will proceed downward from the
IOZ to the DOZ.

     The DOZ, also an underground mine within the 1967 Mining Area, lies
vertically below the IOZ ore body and is currently capable of production.
Initial production from the DOZ commenced in 1989.  However, at the end of
1991, mine output from the DOZ was temporarily suspended, and it is
anticipated that it will resume once the IOZ ore body has been depleted
sometime after 1998.

                                EXPLORATION

     In  addition to continued delineation  of the Grasberg  deposit and other
deposits discussed above, PT-FI is  continuing its ongoing exploration program
for copper and gold mineralization within the 1967 Mining Area.  Two anomalous
zones in  the vicinity of  PT-FI's current mining activities  are under active
exploratory drilling. The  Big Gossan and Wanagon  mineralizations are located
west  of the Erstberg open pit, southwest of  the Grasberg ore body and anchor
the ends of a clearly defined mineralized structure trending roughly east-west
for  4.5 kilometers.    The Big  Gossan  mineralization, as  drilled  to date,
extends approximately  1,100 meters from just east  of the intersection of the
Amole adit.

     Over  50  holes  have  been  drilled from  the  Amole  adit  and  from an
exploration  drift being  driven in a  westerly direction parallel  to the Big
Gossan  structure,  which drilling  resulted in  the  addition of  8.5 million
metric tons of ore at an average grade  of 2.4% copper and 0.77 grams of  gold
per metric ton to PT-FI's  total proved and probable reserves at  December 31,
1993.   Earlier  surface drilling  of the  western portion  of the  Big Gossan
anomaly,  approximately  300-500  meters  west of  the  underground  drilling,
established a  mineral resource in  excess of  6 million metric  tons with  an
average grade of 5% copper and 2.9 grams  of gold per metric ton which is  not
included in PT-FI's total proved  and probable reserves at December 31,  1993.
Further  underground exploration of  the resources established  by the surface
drilling as well as the area  between it and the reserves discovered  near the
Amole adit  will be carried out  in 1994 from  the exploration drift as  it is
extended.

     Mine  planning for development of  the Big Gossan  resource has commenced
with development estimated to cost approximately  $100 million and to begin in
late 1994 or early 1995.

     During the  first quarter  of 1993, PT-FI  initiated helicopter-supported
surface drilling of the Wanagon gold/silver/copper prospect.  Seven holes were
drilled during 1993  at Wanagon, located approximately 2  kilometers northwest
of  Big  Gossan  and  approximately   3  kilometers  southwest  of   Grasberg.
Significant  copper  values  have  been  encountered  below  the  2,900  meter
elevation.  Target   evaluation in other parts of the 1967 Mining Area is also
continuing.

     Preliminary  exploration of the New COW Area has indicated many promising
targets.   Extensive  stream  sediment sampling  within  the new  acreage  has
generated  analytical  results  which  are being  evaluated.    This  sampling
program, when  coupled with regional mapping completed  on the ground and from
aerial photographs, has led to  the outlining of over 50 exploration  targets.
PT-FI has also completed a fixed-wing air-magnetometer survey of the
entire New COW Area.  Detailed follow-up exploration of these anomalies by
additional mapping and sampling and through the use of both aerial and
ground magnetic surveys is now in progress.  Systematic drilling of these
targets has already commenced with mineralization being discovered at
several prospects.  Additional drilling is required to determine if any of
these are commercially viable.

     PT-FI has  focused  its initial  drilling  in the  New  COW Area  on  two
prospects  30  kilometers and  40 kilometers  north  of Grasberg  that display
anomalous geochemical and magnetic  characteristics.  Although these prospects
require  additional exploratory  drilling,  initial results  indicate a  large
mineralized  district   that  covers   three  times   the  aerial   extent  or
approximately  75,000 acres when compared to the original 24,700-acre district
that contained the Ertsberg, Grasberg, Ertsberg East, IOZ, DOZ, Big Gossan and
DOM  ore  bodies.   The discovery  of  widespread igneous  activity, including
volcanic rocks, in these  new areas indicates the potential  for Grasberg-type
stockwork  and porphyry deposits  as well  as skarn-type  copper/gold deposits
similar to the Ertsberg, Ertsberg East, IOZ, DOZ and DOM ore bodies. PT-FI has
also initiated drilling programs  for four other prospects.   Drilling results
are being interpreted.  No assurance can be given that any  of these new areas
contain commercially exploitable mineral deposits.

     PT-FI's exploration expenditures were $31.7 million for 1993, compared to
$12.2 million for 1992.


                     MILLING, EXPANSION AND PRODUCTION

Milling

     Most of the ore from PT-FI's mines moves by a conveyor system to an ore
pass  through which it  drops to the  mill site.   At the mill  site, which is
located approximately  2,900 meters above  sea level, the  ore is  crushed and
ground.  The powdered  ore is then mixed  in tanks with chemical  reagents and
continuously  agitated with air.  At this stage the copper-bearing concentrate
rises to  the top of the  tanks from which it  is removed and  thickened.  The
product  leaves the mill site as a thickened concentrate slurry, consisting of
approximately 65% solids by weight.   During 1993, the recovery rates  for the
milling facilities averaged approximately 87.0%  of the copper content,  76.2%
of the  gold content and  67.2% of the  silver content  of the ore  processed,
compared to 88.2%, 73.7% and 65.5%, respectively, during 1992.

Expansion

     In  1993 PT-FI  completed,  within budget  and  ahead of  schedule,  the
expansion  of its  production  facilities increasing  its  mining and  milling
capacity from  57,000 MTPD to 66,000  MTPD at its Indonesian  complex.  During
1993 mill production averaged  62,300 MTPD.  PT-FI has begun work on a further
expansion of  its  overall mining  and  milling rate  to  115,000 MTPD  at  an
estimated cost of  approximately $685 million, excluding the  capital required
for the Enhanced Infrastructure Project  (the "EIP") and other  infrastructure
improvements,  of which  approximately  $120 million  had  been spent  through
December 31, 1993.   This expansion  is expected to be  completed by or  about
year end 1995.  Funding for this expansion will be obtained from existing cash
balances, cash  flow from  operations and  additional financing,  if required.
Such expansion  beyond  66,000  MTPD  will  also  require  certain  Government
approvals.  This  expansion will  further PT-FI's goal  of approaching  annual
copper  production of  1.1  billion  pounds  and  annual  gold  production  of
approximately 1.5 million ounces.

Production

     In 1993  PT-FI  achieved  record  copper  production of  658.4  million
recoverable pounds, approximately 6% more than in 1992.  Gold production was a
record 786,700 recoverable ounces, an increase of approximately 23% over 1992.
For  a summary of PT-FI's  production, sales and  average product realizations
for 1993 and the previous four years, reference is made to "Selected Financial
and  Operating  Data" appearing  on page  17 of  FCX's  1993 Annual  Report to
stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.


                  TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE

Transportation

     From the  mill site, the thickened concentrate is pumped through two 115
kilometer pipelines to the port-site facility at Amamapare.  At the  port-site
the  slurry is filtered,  dried and stored  for shipping.   When ships arrive,
they are loaded at the dock facilities at  the port-site until they draw their
maximum water.  The ships then normally move to deeper water, where loading is
completed from shuttling barges.

Other Infrastructure

     The location of PT-FI's operations in a remote and undeveloped area
requires that such operations be virtually self-sufficient.  The facilities,
in addition to those described above, include an airport, a heliport, a 119
kilometer road with bridges and tunnels, an aerial service tramway to
transport personnel, equipment and supplies to the mines, a hospital and two
town sites with schools, housing and other required facilities sufficient to
support approximately 12,000 persons, including approximately 360 who are
located at the port-site.

     In conjunction with the expansion of the mining and processing
facilities to 115,000 MTPD, the first phase of the EIP is being implemented.
The EIP is a long term program created (1) to provide certain infrastructure
facilities needed for PT-FI's operations, (2) to enhance the quality of
conditions for PT-FI's employees and (3) to develop and promote the growth of
local and other third party activities and enterprises in Irian Jaya through
the construction of certain required physical support facilities. The full EIP
includes plans for various commercial, residential, educational, retail,
medical, recreational, environmental and other infrastructure facilities to be
constructed during the next ten to twenty years. Depending on the long-term
growth of PT-FI's operations, the total cost of the EIP could range between
$500 million and $600 million. The first phase of the EIP is needed to support
the 115,000 MTPD expansion.  FCX anticipates that the first phase, which
includes various residential, community and commercial facilities and an
extension of the principal road which will enable vehicle traffic to travel
all the way to the port-site, will be completed by mid-1996.

     PT-FI has entered into certain agreements with Huarte S.A. ("Huarte"), a
Spanish construction and engineering company.  These agreements cover the
design, engineering and construction of the facilities to be constructed in
the first phase of the EIP.  Together, the agreements give Huarte
responsibility to deliver completed facilities to PT-FI.

     In March 1993,  PT-FI entered into  a joint venture agreement  with P.T.
ALatieF Nusakarya Corporation ("ALatieF"), an Indonesian investor, pursuant to
which  PT-FI will  sell to  a joint  venture or  ventures (the  "ALatieF Joint
Venture") certain  existing  infrastructure assets  and certain  assets to  be
constructed as part of the EIP  for total consideration of $270 million.   The
ALatieF  Joint Venture, which  is owned one-third  by PT-FI and  two-thirds by
ALatieF,  is  expected to  purchase approximately  $90  million of  EIP assets
annually  over  the   period  1993-1995,  with  funding   provided  by  equity
contributions from the ALatieF  Joint Venture partners ($90 million)  and debt
financing ($180  million), which is expected to be guaranteed by PT-FI, FCX or
both.   The sale of  the first group  of assets to the  ALatieF Joint Venture,
primarily dormitory-style residential  properties and associated food  service
facilities, was  completed in December 1993, for a price  of $90 million.  The
sales which are anticipated for 1994 and later are subject to the execution of
definitive agreements and certain Government approvals.

     The acquired assets will be made available to PT-FI and its employees and
designees under arrangements which will provide the ALatieF Joint Venture with
a guaranteed  minimum rate of  return on its investment.  Certain existing EIP
related contracts with Huarte will be assigned to the ALatieF Joint Venture as
appropriate.

     In December  1993, PT-FI announced  the execution of  a Letter of  Intent
with  Duke Energy Corp. ("DE")  and PowerLink Corporation  ("PL"), pursuant to
which PT-FI would sell its existing and to be constructed power generation and
transmission  assets and certain other power-related assets to a joint venture
(the "Power  Joint Venture")  whose ownership  would consist  of DE (30%),  PL
(30%), PT-FI (30%) and  an Indonesian investor (10%).  The total  value of the
transaction is  estimated at $200 million  and is expected to  be concluded in
two phases.   The first sale, representing the existing assets, is expected to
exceed $100  million and to occur  in mid-1994.  The  final sale, representing
the to-be-constructed  expansion-related assets,  is expected to  occur during
the first half of 1995.  Under the agreement, the Power Joint Venture will own
these  assets and be responsible  for providing the  electrical power services
required by PT-FI at its mining, milling and support operations in Irian Jaya,
Indonesia,  including the  power services  required for  the expansion  of ore
throughput to 115,000 MTPD.

     PT-FI has  also entered into two separate letters of intent with respect
to  the  sale  to joint  ventures  of certain  aircraft,  airport  and related
operations (the  "Airport Joint Venture") and  certain construction equipment,
certain  port facilities and related marine, logistics and related assets (the
"Port Joint Venture").  PT-FI would have a 25% equity interest in the  Airport
Joint Venture, with certain Indonesian investors controlling the
remainder.  PT-FI would enter into one or more agreements with the Airport
Joint Venture for air transport services for both passengers and cargo.  It
is expected that the purchase price of the assets transferred to the
Airport Joint Venture will be approximately $30 million.

     The Port  Joint Venture  is  expected to  be  owned by  a  multinational
shipping  concern and  three to  five  Indonesian investors  (one of  which is
expected to be ALatieF).   PT-FI is not expected to have an equity interest in
the Port Joint Venture.   PT-FI would enter  into one or more  agreements with
the Port Joint Venture for use of the transferred assets.  It is expected that
the purchase  price of the assets  transferred to the Port  Joint Venture will
not exceed $100 million.

     The foregoing letters of intent  are not binding and are subject  to the
execution  of  definitive  agreements,   financing,  and  certain   Government
approvals.   No assurance can be given that  any of these transactions will be
consummated.

                                 MARKETING

     PT-FI's copper  concentrates, which contain significant  gold and silver
components,  are  sold primarily  under  long-term,  U. S.  dollar-denominated
contracts,  pursuant to  which  the selling  price  is based  on  world metals
prices,  generally the  London Metal  Exchange  ("LME") settlement  prices for
Grade A  copper  metal, less  certain  allowances.   Under a  major  long-term
contract signed in late  1990, approximately 44% of the  concentrates produced
by PT-FI in 1993 were  sold to a group of Japanese  copper smelting companies.
PT-FI also supplies  copper concentrates  to other Asian,  European and  North
American smelters  and international  trading companies under  long-term sales
agreements.  Virtually all  of PT-FI's 1993 production of  copper concentrates
was  sold  under prior  commitments, and  PT-FI  has commitments  from various
parties to purchase  virtually all of its estimated 1994  production of copper
concentrates.  For further detail with  respect to sales of concentrates,  see
Note 8 to the FCX Financial Statements.

     For average realizations per recoverable pound of copper,
see "Selected Financial and Operating Data" on page 17 of
FCX's 1993 Annual Report to stockholders.  PT-FI has in place a
price protection program that eliminates exposure to copper price declines
below an average $.90 per recoverable pound for estimated copper sales priced
during 1994, while allowing full benefit to PT-FI for prices above that
level.  The cost of the 1994 price protection program, $6 million, is
included in product inventories and is being amortized as an adjustment to
revenues as sales are priced during 1994.


                           REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA

     The economy of Indonesia  is based on export commodity  agriculture, the
extraction  of petroleum, natural  gas and other  mineral resources, wholesale
and retail trade and, to an increasing extent, manufacturing.  Indonesia has a
presidential republic system  of government.  President Suharto  assumed power
in 1966  following an attempted  communist coup  and has been  in power  since
then.  The Government has  maintained a high degree of stability  for the past
26 years.   President Suharto was  re-elected in March  1993 to serve  a sixth
consecutive five-year term.

     The  Government has promoted policies designed to help develop Indonesia
economically  and has encouraged  foreign investment  in numerous  areas where
such investment  would benefit  the Indonesian  economy.   Indonesia's foreign
investment policy is expressed in the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law.  It
provides  basic  guarantees  of   remittance  rights  and  protection  against
nationalization,  a framework for  incentives and some  basic rules as  to the
other  rights  and  obligations of  foreign  investors.    PT-FI's rights  and
obligations  relating  to taxes,  exchange  controls,  repatriation and  other
matters are governed by the  New COW, which was concluded pursuant to the 1967
Foreign Capital Investment Law.

    PT-FI  has had and continues  to enjoy a  good working relationship with
the  Government.  PT-FI's mining  complex was Indonesia's  first copper mining
project and was the first major foreign investment made in Indonesia following
the new economic development program  instituted by the Suharto administration
in 1967.   PT-FI works closely  with the various levels  of the Government  in
development  efforts  in  the  vicinity  of  its  operations.    PT-FI  incurs
significant costs associated with providing health and educational assistance,
job  training, employment  opportunities,  agricultural assistance  and  other
community development services and facilities for the Indonesian people living
in  the areas of  its operations.   In 1990 PT-FI  established a foundation to
provide educational and  work opportunities for the  benefit of the  people of
Irian  Jaya.  Over the next several years,  PT-FI will contribute at least $10
million  to the foundation for community projects.   PT-FI also has in place a
long-term  business development program  to provide financing  and support for
new  and emerging businesses,  many of which  are expected to  be suppliers of
goods  and  services for  PT-FI's operations.    Over time,  PT-FI anticipates
investing $25 million in this program.

     FCX  has the  benefit  of political  risk  insurance from  the  Overseas
Private Investment  Corporation, the  Multilateral Investment  Guaranty Agency
and other insurers, where available, which covers a portion of its interest in
PT-FI.    The insurance  is  primarily  designed to  cover  certain breach  of
contract risks.


                          RIO TINTO MINERA, S.A.

     In March 1993, FCX acquired  a 65% interest in RTM, which  is principally
engaged in the smelting and refining of copper in Spain, for approximately $50
million,  excluding transaction  costs.   In December  1993, RTM  redeemed the
remaining  35% interest for approximately $19 million. RTM has announced plans
to expand its smelter production capacity from its current 150,000 metric tons
of  metal per year to  approximately 180,000 metric tons of  metal per year by
1995  at  a cost  of  approximately  $50 million.    RTM  is studying  further
expansion to  as much as  270,000 metric  tons of metal  production per  year.
During  1993,  PT-FI supplied  RTM with  approximately  90,000 metric  tons of
copper concentrate and is expected to supply approximately 150,000 metric tons
in  1994,  providing for  approximately 20%  and  33%, respectively,  of RTM's
requirements in  those years.  Beginning in 1996, PT-FI is expected to provide
the  RTM  smelter  with  approximately  one-half  of  its  copper  concentrate
requirements.    For further  information  concerning  RTM,
reference is made to the information set forth in Item 7 below.


                       EASTERN MINING COMPANY, INC.

     FCX's  subsidiary Eastern Mining  was granted an  exploration permit (the
"SIPP")  in April 1993  which gives exclusive  rights for a  limited period to
explore for  minerals on 2.5 million  acres (the "SIPP Area")  adjacent to the
New COW Area. Preliminary exploration of the SIPP Area is under way.

      A draft of a contract of work ("Eastern Mining Draft") was initialled on
January 30, 1993 by the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Indonesia and  Eastern
Mining which  covers the SIPP Area. The Eastern Mining Draft will be submitted
to the President of Indonesia, with execution of a definitive contract of work
expected  in 1994.  The Eastern  Mining Draft,  as initialled, provides  for a
30-year  term and for two 10-year extensions under certain circumstances. Upon
execution, an Indonesian limited liability company will be formed to  hold the
definitive contract  of work which  initially is  to be owned  80% by  Eastern
Mining and 10% by each of PT-II and an unrelated Indonesian corporation.


                      RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     In February 1993, FTX outsourced its corporate engineering, research and
development, corporate  environmental and  corporate safety functions  and, to
that end,  contracted with a new company initially owned and staffed by former
employees  of  FTX, Crescent  Technology,  Inc.  ("Crescent"), that  furnishes
services to FTX.   Crescent maintains engineering and mine  development groups
in New Orleans, Louisiana, which  provide engineering, design and construction
supervision  activities   required  to   implement  new  ventures   and  apply
improvements to existing operations of PT-FI and RTM.

                           ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     FTX and its affiliates, including FCX, have a history of commitment to
environmental responsibility.  Since the 1940s, long before the general public
recognized the importance of maintaining environmental quality, FTX has
conducted, and continues to conduct, preoperational, bioassay, marine
ecological and other environmental surveys to determine the environmental
compatibility of its operations.  FTX's Environmental Policy commits its
operations to full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  FTX has
contracted with Crescent whose environmental specialists develop and implement
environmental programs that include the activities of PT-FI.

     The management  of  PT-FI  believes  that  it  is  in  compliance  with
Indonesian environmental laws,  rules and regulations.   PT-FI  had a team  of
environmental  scientists from  a  leading  Indonesian scientific  institution
conduct  a study  to  update its  1984  Environmental Evaluation  Study,  with
particular focus on its 66,000 MTPD expansion program, and which addressed the
anticipated  effect of  PT-FI's expansion  to 66,000  MTPD on  the environment
within  the  study  area  including  water  quality, aquatic  and  terrestrial
biology, hydrology, geomorphology, oceanography, sociology and economics.  The
study was submitted to  the Government, and a  formal hearing was held  on the
document.   The  Government then  requested PT-FI  to  update the  document to
include future expansion plans.   An additional environmental evaluation study
was  submitted  in  late  1993  with  respect  to  the proposed  expansion  of
production to 115,000 MTPD, and it was approved in February 1994.

     PT-FI and  RTM,  through FTX,  maintain  insurance coverage  in  amounts
deemed prudent  for  certain types  of damages  associated with  environmental
liabilities which arise from sudden, unexpected and unforeseen events.

     PT-FI  has made, and continues  to make, expenditures  at its operations
for  protection of  the  environment.    Government  and  public  emphasis  on
environmental matters can  be expected  to require PT-FI  to incur  additional
costs,  which will be  charged against income  from future operations.   It is
possible  that  the Government  could  revise  its environmental  laws  and/or
regulations periodically.  The  impact, if any, of such possible  revisions on
PT-FI's  operations cannot be accurately  predicted.  However,  PT-FI does not
anticipate   that  any  investments  which  might  be  required  will  have  a
significant  adverse  impact  on  its future  operations,  liquidity,  capital
resources or financial position.


                                 EMPLOYEES

     In order  to allow access to  the FTX employee benefit  plans for United
States  citizens  employed full  time in  PT-FI's  and RTM's  businesses, such
persons  are formally employed by  certain United States  subsidiaries of FTX.
For  all  operational purposes,  however,  such  individuals are  regarded  as
employees of PT-FI or RTM, respectively, and references herein to PT-FI or RTM
employees include such individuals.

     FCX, PT-FI  and FTX are parties to  a Management Services Agreement (the
"Management  Agreement") pursuant  to which  FTX furnishes  general executive,
administrative, financial, accounting, legal, environmental, tax, research and
development,  sales and certain other services to FCX  and PT-FI.  The term of
the Management  Agreement is unlimited, subject  to termination by  any of the
parties  on December 31 of any year and  subject to at least six months' prior
written notice.    FCX  and  PT-FI reimburse  FTX  at  FTX's  cost,  including
allocated  overhead, for  such  services on  a  monthly  basis.   For  further
information  with  respect  to   the  Management  Agreement,  including  costs
reimbursed  to  FTX, reference  is  made  to  Note  9  to  the  FCX  Financial
Statements.

     As  of  December  31,  1993,  PT-FI  had  a  total  of  6,054  employees
(approximately 94%  Indonesian), compared with 4,983  employees (approximately
91% Indonesian) at year-end 1992.  In addition, as of December 31, 1993, PT-FI
had  approximately  6,600 contract  workers,  most  of  whom were  Indonesian.
Approximately  40%  of PT-FI's  Indonesian employees  are  members of  the All
Indonesia Workers'  Union, which  operates under Government  supervision, with
which a labor agreement covering PT-FI's hourly paid Indonesian employees runs
until September  30, 1995.  PT-FI  experienced no work stoppages  in 1993, and
relations with  the union have generally been good.   As of December 31, 1993,
RTM  had a total of  1,216 employees, of which  1,003 employees are covered by
union  contracts.   RTM  experienced  limited  work  stoppages  in  1993,  but
relations with these unions have also generally been good.


                                COMPETITION

     PT-FI competes with other  mining companies in connection with  the sale
of its mineral  concentrates and  the recruitment and  retention of  qualified
personnel.  Some competing  companies possess financial resources equal  to or
greater than those of PT-FI.  The management of FCX believes that PT-FI is one
of the  lowest cost copper producers in the world, taking into account credits
for related gold and silver production.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.
- ---------------------------

     Although FCX  may  be  from  time  to time  involved  in  various  legal
proceedings  of a  character normally incident  to the ordinary  course of its
business, the management of FCX believes that potential liability in any  such
pending or threatened proceedings would not have a material  adverse effect on
the financial  condition or results of  operations of FCX.   FCX, through FTX,
maintains  liability  insurance   to  cover  some,  but  not   all,  potential
liabilities normally incident to the ordinary  course of its business as  well
as other insurance  coverages customary  in its business,  with such  coverage
limits as management deems prudent.

ORE RESERVE ADDITIONS AND ONGOING EXPLORATION PROGRAM
Total estimated proved and probable recoverable reserves at P.T.  Freeport
Indonesia Company (PT-FI), Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.'s (FCX or the
Company) principal operating unit, have increased since December 31, 1992,
by 5.9 billion pounds of copper (a 28 percent increase), 7.0 million ounces
of gold (a 22 percent increase), and 32.0 million ounces of silver (a 72
percent increase), bringing PT-FI's total year-end 1993 estimated proved
and probable recoverable reserves to 26.8 billion pounds of copper, 39.1
million ounces of gold and 76.7 million ounces of silver.  The increases,
net of production during the year, were added primarily at the Grasberg
deposit, but also include additions at the Company's underground mine at
the DOZ (Deep Ore Zone) deposit and the recently discovered Big Gossan
deposit.

     In addition to continued delineation of the Grasberg deposit and other
deposits including Big Gossan, PT-FI is proceeding with its ongoing
exploration program for mineralization within the original mining area.
During 1993, PT-FI initiated helicopter-supported surface drilling of the
Wanagon gold/silver/copper prospect, located 1.5 miles northwest of Big
Gossan and 2 miles southwest of Grasberg, where seven holes were drilled.
Significant copper mineralization has been encountered below the 2,900
meter elevation.

     Preliminary exploration of the new contract of work area (New COW
Area) has indicated numerous promising targets.  Extensive stream sediment
sampling within the new acreage has generated analytical results which are
being evaluated.  This sampling program, when coupled with regional mapping
completed on the ground and from aerial photographs, has led to the
outlining of over 50 exploration targets.  PT-FI has also completed a
fixed-wing air-magnetometer survey of the entire New COW Area.  Detailed
follow-up exploration of these anomalies by additional mapping and sampling
and through the use of both aerial and ground magnetic surveys is now in
progress.  Systematic drilling of these targets has already commenced with
significant mineralization being discovered at several prospects.
Additional drilling is required to determine if any of these are
commercially viable.  Initial surface and stream sampling began on an
additional 2.5 million acres, just north and west of our existing COW area,
on which an affiliate has an exploration permit and a pending COW.

1993 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED WITH 1992

After discussions with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), FCX is reclassifying certain expenses and accruals previously
recorded in 1993 as restructuring and valuation of assets.  In response to
inquiries, the Company advised the SEC staff that $15.5 million originally
reported as restructuring and valuation of assets represented the
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle resulting from the
adoption of the new accounting policies that the Company considered
preferable, as described in Note 1 to the financial statements.  The
Company also informed the SEC staff of the components of other charges
included in the amount originally reported as restructuring and valuation
of assets.  The Company concluded that the reclassification and the related
supplemental disclosures more accurately reflect the nature of these
charges to 1993 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  These reclassifications had no impact on net income or net
income per share.

     FCX reported 1993 net income applicable to common stock of $21.9
million ($.11 per share) compared with net income of $122.9 million ($.66
per share) for 1992.  The results for 1993 reflect (a) a $15.7 million loss
for Rio Tinto Minera, S.A.  (RTM) since its acquisition (Note 3) and (b)
charges totaling $52.6 million ($30.4 million to net income or $.15 per
share), of which $28.3 million was noncash, related to (1) restructuring
the administrative organization at Freeport-McMoRan Inc.  (FTX), the parent
company of FCX, (2) adjustments to general and administrative expenses and
site production and delivery costs discussed below, and (3) changes in
accounting principle, discussed further in Note 1 to the financial
statements.  Operating income was lower in 1993 due to a lower gross margin
resulting primarily from lower copper realizations; higher exploration
expenses; administrative restructuring costs (Note 1); and higher general
and administrative costs.  Also impacting net income were lower interest
expense resulting from reduced debt levels, a higher effective tax rate,
and an increase in preferred dividends (Notes 4 and 5).

     Revenues in 1993 increased as a result of the acquisition of RTM,
adding sales of copper cathodes and anodes ($204.9 million), gold bullion
($57.4 million), and other products ($26.1 million).  Excluding RTM,
revenues declined 4 percent when compared to 1992.  Copper price
realizations, taking into account PT-FI's $.90 per pound price protection
program, were 12 percent lower than in 1992, but gold price realizations
were up 6 percent.  Although ore production averaged 62,300 metric tons of
ore milled per day (MTPD) in 1993 (8 percent higher than in 1992), copper
sales volumes decreased slightly from 1992 primarily because of sales from
inventory in 1992.  Gold sales volumes in 1993 benefited from significantly
higher fourth-quarter 1993 gold grades (a 46 percent increase over fourth-
quarter 1992 and a 38 percent increase over third-quarter 1993), which are
not anticipated to continue in 1994, and an increase in gold recovery rates
for the year which improve with higher gold grades.  See Selected Financial
and Operating Data.

     A reconciliation of revenues from 1992 to 1993 is presented below (in
     millions):


 Revenues - 1992 ...........................................      $714.3
 RTM revenues    ...........................................       288.4
 Elimination of intercompany sales..........................       (47.7)

 Revenues - 1993                                                  $925.9
                                                                  ======

     Revenues also benefited from a decline in treatment charges of 3.4
cents per pound from 1992, resulting from a tightening in the concentrate
market, as the industry's inventories were reduced for much of 1993.
Additionally, lower copper prices led to lower treatment charges since
these charges vary with the price of copper.

     Adjustments to prior year concentrate sales include changes in prices
on all metals for prior year open sales as well as the related impact on
treatment charges.  Open copper sales at the beginning of 1993 were
recorded at an average price of $1.04 per pound, but subsequently were
adjusted downward as copper prices fell during the year, negatively
impacting 1993 revenues.  As of December 31, 1993, 213.4 million pounds of
copper remained to be contractually priced during future quotational
periods.  As a result of PT-FI's price protection program, discussed below,
these pounds are recorded at $.90 per pound.  The copper price on the
London Metal Exchange (LME) was $.84 per pound on February 1, 1994.

     In June 1993, two of PT-FI's four mill level ore passes caved,
resulting in a blockage of a portion of the ore pass delivery system.  The
blockage's primary effect was to limit mill throughput to approximately
40,700 MTPD for approximately eight weeks.  The impact of the blockage was
minimized by using an ore stockpile adjacent to the mill and installing
conveyors to alternative ore pass systems.  The ore pass blockage has been
rectified through the temporary use of alternative delivery systems and by-
passes.  A permanent delivery system is expected to be in service by mid-
1994.  The copper recovery rate for 1993 was adversely affected because the
ore milled from the stockpile contained higher than normal oxidized copper,
which yields lower copper recoveries.  The Company's insurance policies are
expected to cover the property damage and business interruption claims
relative to the blockage.

     PT-FI's unit site production and delivery costs, excluding the $10.0
million charge discussed below, increased slightly from 1992 primarily as a
result of costs incurred in connection with the ore pass blockage and an
increase in production overhead costs related to expansion activities.
Unit cash production costs declined significantly to 31.1 cents per pound
in 1993 from 40.7 cents per pound in 1992, benefiting from higher gold and
silver credits, lower treatment charges, and reduced royalties primarily
due to lower copper prices on which such royalties are based.  PT-FI's
depreciation rate increased from 7.4 cents per recoverable pound during
1992 to 8.3 cents in 1993, reflecting the increased cost relating to the
66,000 MTPD expansion.  As a result of the reserve additions discussed
earlier, PT-FI's depreciation rate is expected to decrease to 7.5 cents per
recoverable pound for 1994, absent any other significant changes in ore
reserves.  In addition, FCX is amortizing costs in excess of book value
($2.4 million of amortization in 1993) relating to certain capital stock
transactions with PT-FI.  Amortization of these excess costs is expected to
be $3.6 million per year starting in 1994.

     Exploration expenditures in Irian Jaya totaled $31.7 million in 1993,
compared to $12.2 million in 1992 and are projected to be approximately $35
million in 1994.  Exploration expenditures in Spain are expected to be
approximately $6 million in 1994.

     FCX's general and administrative expenses increased from $68.5 million
in 1992 to $81.4 million in 1993 primarily because of the additional
personnel and facilities needed due to the expansion at PT-FI and the
acquisition of RTM.  Included in the 1993 expense is $5.0 million for RTM
(since its acquisition in March 1993) and charges of $6.3 million primarily
consisting of a write-off of deferred charges incurred in 1992 related to a
planned securities offering that was withdrawn ($2.0 million) and costs to
downsize FCX's computing and management information systems (MIS) structure
($4.0 million).

     Further increases in general and administrative expenses by FCX are
anticipated in conjunction with continuing expansion at PT-FI.  General and
administrative expenses, including those of RTM, are currently expected to
increase by approximately 25 percent in 1994.

     During the second quarter of 1993, FTX undertook a restructuring of
its administrative organization.  This restructuring represented a major
step by FTX to lower its costs of operating and administering its
businesses in response to weak market prices of the commodities produced by
its operating units.  As part of this restructuring, FTX significantly
reduced the number of employees engaged in administrative functions,
changed its MIS environment to achieve efficiencies, reduced its needs for
office space, outsourced a number of administrative functions, and
implemented other actions to lower costs.  As a result of this
restructuring process, the level of FCX's administrative cost has been
reduced substantially over what it would have been otherwise, which benefit
will continue in the future.  However, the restructuring process entailed
incurring certain one-time costs by FTX, portions of which were allocated
to FCX pursuant to its management services agreement with FTX.

     FCX's restructuring costs totaled $20.8 million, including $10.7
million allocated from FTX based on historical allocations, consisting of
the following: $8.3 million for personnel related costs; $3.2 million
relating to excess office space and furniture and fixtures resulting from
the staff reduction; $6.1 million relating to the cost to downsize its
computing and MIS structure; and $3.2 million of deferred charges relating
to PT-FI's 1989 credit facility which was substantially revised in June
1993.  As of December 31, 1993, the remaining accrual for these
restructuring costs totaled $1.5 million relating to excess office space.

     In connection with the restructuring project, FCX changed its
accounting systems and undertook a detailed review of its accounting
records.  As a result of this process, FCX recorded a $10.0 million charge
to site production and delivery costs comprised of the following: $5.0
million for materials and supplies inventory obsolescence; $2.5 million for
revised estimates of value added taxes and import duties related to prior
years; and $2.5 million of adjustments for various items identified in
converting its accounting system.

     Interest expense was $15.3 million during 1993 compared with $18.9
million in 1992, excluding $24.5 million and $24.0 million of capitalized
interest, respectively.

     The New COW provides a 35 percent corporate income tax rate for PT-FI
and a 15 percent withholding tax on interest for debt incurred after the
signing of the New COW and on dividends paid to FCX by PT-FI.  The
additional withholding required on interest and on dividends paid to FCX by
PT-FI, and a $15.7 million loss by RTM for which no tax benefit is
recorded, results in a 1993 effective tax rate of 52 percent (Note 6).

TRENDS AND OUTLOOK - MARKETING

PT-FI's copper concentrates, which contain significant amounts of
recoverable gold and silver, are sold primarily under long-term sales
agreements which accounted for virtually all of PT-FI's 1993 sales.  PT-FI
has commitments from various parties to purchase virtually all of its
estimated 1994 production.  Concentrate sales agreements provide for
provisional billings based on world metals prices, primarily the LME,
generally at the time of loading.  As is customary within the industry,
sales under these long-term contracts usually "final-price" within a few
months of shipment.  Certain terms of the long-term contracts, including
treatment charges, are negotiated annually on a portion of the tonnage to
reflect current market conditions.  Treatment charges have declined during
1993 as a result of the tightening in the concentrate market and are
expected to remain at or below 1993 levels.  RTM has commitments from most
of its suppliers for 1994 treatment charge rates in excess of current spot
market rates.

     The increased production at PT-FI has required it to market its
concentrate globally.  Its principal markets include Japan, Asia, Europe
and North America.  PT-FI's mill throughput is currently forecast to be
approximately 67,000 MTPD for 1994 as it continues to integrate new mill
equipment for the expansion to 115,000 MTPD.  Current estimates for 1994
production are approximately 700 million pounds of copper and 780,000
ounces of gold for PT-FI and 165,000 ounces of gold at RTM.  RTM, whose
smelter can be expanded, was acquired to provide low-cost smelter capacity
for a portion of PT-FI's concentrate and to improve PT-FI's competitive
position in marketing concentrate to other parties.

     During 1993, copper prices dropped to their lowest levels since 1987,
reflecting lower demand caused by the continuing global recession, but
recovered to a level in excess of $.80 per pound.  Prices for copper, gold,
and silver are influenced by many factors beyond the Company's control and
can fluctuate sharply.  PT-FI has a price protection program for virtually
all of its estimated copper sales to be priced in 1994 at an average floor
price of $.90 per pound of copper, while allowing full benefit from prices
above this amount.  Based on projected 1994 PT-FI copper sales of
approximately 720 million pounds, a 1 cent per pound change in the average
annual copper price received over $.90 per pound would have an
approximately $6 million effect on pretax operating income and cash flow.
Based on projected 1994 gold sales of approximately 800,000 ounces by PT-
FI, a $10 per ounce change in the average annual gold price received would
have an approximately $8 million effect on 1994 pretax operating income and
cash flow.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

     Cash flow from operations decreased to $158.5 million during 1993
compared with $252.6 million for 1992, due primarily to lower net income
and an increase in inventories.  Materials and supplies increased over
year-end 1992 as additional explosives, reagents and chemicals, fuel, and
spare parts are required for the expanding PT-FI operations.  For the year
ended December 31, 1993, consolidated working capital decreased by $352.0
million from December 31, 1992, primarily as a result of a $358.0 million
decrease in cash and short-term investments, which was used to reduce long-
term debt and fund capital expenditures, and the negative working capital
position of RTM.

     Cash flow used in investing activities totaled $463.5 million compared
with $579.7 million in 1992.  Capital expenditures increased 23 percent in
1993 due to increased expansion activities.  During 1992, FCX acquired an
indirect interest in PT-FI for $211.9 million.

     Cash flow used in financing activities totaled $53.1 million compared
with $618.2 million provided by financing activities in 1992.  FCX issued
shares of its Step-Up Preferred Stock and its Gold-Denominated Preferred
Stock during 1993 for net proceeds totaling $561.1 million.  Net proceeds
from the two offerings were used in part to reduce borrowings under the PT-
FI amended credit agreement by a net $537.0 million, thereby increasing the
facility's availability for general corporate purposes and the continued
expansion of mining and milling operations.  Also in 1993, the Company
received net proceeds of $80.0 million from the sale of a portion of PT-
FI's infrastructure assets (Note 10).  In 1992, $212.5 million was received
from the sale of a 10 percent interest in PT-FI to Indonesian investors in
December 1991 and $392.0 million was received from the sale of Class A
common stock and Special Preference Stock.  Dividend payments rose in 1993
due to increased Class A shares outstanding and dividends paid on the
Special Preference and Preferred Stock issued in 1992 and 1993.  FCX called
its Zero Coupon Exchangeable Notes (Note 7) for redemption in January 1994
(substantially all of which were exchanged for Class A common stock) and
completed a public offering of its Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock, Series
II (Note 4) which yielded net proceeds of $158.5 million to be used
primarily for expansion related activities.

     Cash flow from operations increased to $252.6 million during 1992
compared with $73.9 million for 1991, due primarily to higher net income.
Customer accounts receivable rose by $76.1 million to $130.6 million
because of increased sales.  Partially offsetting the increase in
receivables was an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities
associated with expansion activities.  Cash flow used in investing
activities increased to $579.7 million during 1992 compared with $240.0
million for 1991, due to increased capital expenditures for the 57,000 MTPD
expansion and the purchase of an indirect interest in PT-FI.  Cash flow
from financing activities increased $415.8 million in 1992 compared with
1991, primarily due to the sale of Class A common stock, Special Preference
Stock, and a 10 percent interest in PT-FI to Indonesian investors.  The
proceeds from these financing activities were used to purchase an indirect
interest in PT-FI and to fund ongoing expansion related expenditures.

     RTM's principal operations currently consist of a copper smelter.  The
FCX purchase proceeds will be used by RTM for working capital requirements
and capital expenditures, including funding a portion of the expansion of
its smelter production capacity (expected to cost approximately $50
million) from its current 150,000 metric tons of metal per year to 180,000
metric tons of metal per year by mid-1995.  RTM is also studying further
expansion of the smelter facilities to as much as 270,000 metric tons of
metal production per year and is assessing the opportunity to expand its
tankhouse operations from 135,000 metric tons per year to 215,000 metric
tons per year.  RTM's 1993 cash flow from operations was negative ($5.9
million) primarily due to cash requirements related to shut-down costs for
RTM's gold mine.  RTM has relied on short-term credit facilities and the
FCX purchase proceeds to fund this shortfall.  RTM is currently evaluating
financing alternatives to fund its short-term needs and to provide long-
term funding for expansion.  RTM's future cash flow is dependent on a
number of variables including fluctuations in the exchange rate between the
United States dollar and the Spanish peseta, future prices and sales
volumes of gold, the size and timing of the smelter and tankhouse
expansions, and the supply/demand for smelter capacity and its impact on
related treatment and refining charges.

     During 1992, the Company established the Enhanced Infrastructure
Project (EIP).  The full EIP (currently expected to involve aggregate cost
of as much as $500 million to $600 million) includes plans for commercial,
residential, educational, retail, medical, recreational, environmental and
other infrastructure facilities to be constructed during the next 20 years
for PT-FI operations.  The EIP will develop and promote the growth of local
and other third-party activities and enterprises in Irian Jaya through the
creation of certain necessary support facilities.  The initial phase of the
EIP is under construction and is scheduled for completion in 1995.
Additional expenditures for EIP assets beyond the initial phase depend on
the long-term growth of PT-FI's operations and would be expected to be
funded by third-party financing sources, which may include debt, equity or
asset sales.  As discussed in Note 10, certain portions of the EIP and
other existing infrastructure assets are expected to be sold in the near
future to provide additional funds for the expansion to 115,000 MTPD.

     Through 1995, capital expenditures are expected to be greater than
cash flow from operations.  Upon completion of the previously announced
115,000 MTPD expansion by year-end 1995, annual production is expected to
approach 1.1 billion pounds of copper and 1.5 million ounces of gold.
Subsequently, capital expenditures will be determined by the results of
FCX's exploration activities and ongoing capital maintenance programs.
Estimated capital expenditures for 1994 and 1995 for the expansion to
115,000 MTPD, the initial phase of the EIP, ongoing capital maintenance
expenditures, and the expansion of RTM's smelter to 180,000 metric tons of
metal per year are expected to range from $850 million to $950 million and
will be funded by operating cash flow, sales of existing and to-be-
constructed infrastructure assets and a wide range of financing sources the
Company believes are available as a result of the future cash flow from PT-
FI's mineral reserve asset base.  These sources include, but are not
limited to, PT-FI's credit facility and the public and private issuances of
securities (including the January 1994 public offering of Gold-Denominated
Preferred Stock, Series II).

     The New COW contains provisions for PT-FI to conduct or cause to be
conducted a feasibility study relating to the construction of a copper
smelting facility in Indonesia and for the eventual construction of such a
facility, if it is deemed to be economically viable by PT-FI and the
Government of Indonesia (the Government).  PT-FI has participated in a
group assessing the feasibility of constructing a copper smelting facility
in Indonesia.

     PT-FI amended its $550.0 million credit agreement in June 1993.  The
amended credit agreement, which, among other things eliminated a required
debt service reserve and provided a lower interest rate, is guaranteed by
FCX and FTX, and is structured as a three year revolving line of credit
followed by a 3 1/2 year reducing revolver.  As of February 1, 1994, $425.0
million was available to PT-FI under the credit facility.  To the extent
FTX and its other subsidiaries incur additional debt, the amount available
to PT-FI under the credit facility may be reduced (Note 7).

     Payment of future dividends by FCX will depend on the payment of
dividends by PT-FI, which, in turn, depends on PT-FI's economic resources,
profitability, cash flow and capital expenditures.  It is the policy of PT-
FI to maximize its dividend payments to stockholders, taking into account
its operational cash needs including debt service requirements.  FCX
currently pays an annual cash dividend of 60 cents per share to its common
shareholders.  Management anticipates that this dividend will continue at
this level through completion of the expansion in 1995, absent significant
changes in the prices of copper and gold.  However, FCX's Board of
Directors determines its dividend payment on a quarterly basis and in its
discretion may change or maintain the dividend payment.  In determining
dividend policy, the Board of Directors considers many factors, including
current and expected future prices and sales volumes, future capital
expenditure requirements, and the availability and cost of financing from
third parties.

     PT-FI has had good relations with the Government since it commenced
operations in Indonesia in 1967.  The New COW provides that the Government
will not nationalize the mining operations of PT-FI or expropriate assets
of PT-FI.  Disputes under the New COW are to be resolved by international
arbitration.  The 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which expresses
Indonesia's foreign investment policy, provides basic guarantees of
remittance rights and protection against nationalization, a framework for
incentives and some basic rules as to other rights and obligations of
foreign investors.

ENVIRONMENTAL

     FTX and affiliates, including FCX, have a history of commitment to
environmental responsibility.  Since the 1940s, long before public
attention focused on the importance of maintaining environmental quality,
FTX has conducted preoperational, bioassay, marine ecological, and other
environmental surveys to ensure the environmental compatibility of its
operations.  FTX's Environmental Policy commits FTX's operations to full
compliance with local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

     The Company believes it is in compliance with Indonesian environmental
laws, rules, and regulations.  The Company had a team of environmental
scientists from a leading Indonesian scientific institution conduct a study
to update its 1984 Environmental Impact Assessment that covered expansion
to 66,000 MTPD.  Subsequently, that document was expanded by other
independent scientists to cover all environmental aspects of the current
expansion to 115,000 MTPD.  The latest study document was submitted to the
Government in December 1993.  Based on preliminary hearings, the Company
believes the study document will be accepted substantially as submitted.

     The Company has made, and will continue to make, expenditures at its
operations for protection of the environment.  Increasing emphasis on
environmental matters can be expected to require the Company to incur
additional costs, which will be charged against income from future
operations.  On the basis of its analysis of its operations in relation to
current and presently anticipated environmental requirements, management
does not anticipate that these investments will have a significant adverse
impact on its future operations, liquidity, capital resources, or financial
position.

1992 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED WITH 1991
FCX reported 1992 net income of $122.9 million ($.66 per share)
compared with 1991 net income of $96.2 million ($.53 per share).
A reconciliation of revenues from 1991 to 1992
is presented below (in millions):


 Revenues - 1991 ..............................................      $467.5
 Price realizations:
   Copper .....................................................         8.8
   Gold........................................................        (7.4)

                                                                     ------
 Revenues - 1992 ..............................................      $714.3
                                                                     ======

     Revenues increased 53 percent in 1992, reflecting higher production
rates due to the mine/mill expansion, higher gold grades, and the sale of
all year-end 1991 inventory.  Price realizations were relatively unchanged
between years (2 percent increase in copper realizations and 5 percent
decrease in gold realizations), but sales volumes benefited significantly
from the expansion, higher gold grades, and inventory sales discussed
above.  Copper sales volumes increased 48 percent and gold sales volumes
increased 71 percent.  Partially offsetting the benefit from sales volumes
increases was a 3.6 cents per pound increase in treatment charges because
of tight market conditions in the smelting industry early in 1992 and
increased spot market sales attributable to higher than anticipated
production due to the early completion of the 57,000 MTPD expansion
program.  A $5.7 million upward revenue adjustment was made in 1992
compared with a $6.8 million downward revenue adjustment in 1991 for prior
year concentrate sales contractually priced during the year.

     Cost of sales for 1992 were $357.2 million, an increase of 47 percent
from 1991 due primarily to the 48 percent increase in copper sales volumes.
Unit site production and delivery costs in 1992 approximated 1991 costs.
FCX's depreciation rate declined from an average 8.7 cents per recoverable
pound in 1991 to 7.4 cents in 1992 because of the significant increase in
ore reserves during 1991.

     Interest expense was $18.9 million during 1992 compared with $21.5
million in 1991, excluding $24.0 million and $18.3 million of capitalized
interest, respectively.

     The 1992 general and administrative expenses rose to $68.5 million
from $40.6 million in 1991, because of several financing transactions and
operational and environmental studies in 1992 which required additional
corporate personnel whose salaries and related overhead, were charged to
the Company.  General and administrative expenses also increased because of
the additional personnel and facilities needed in Indonesia for the
expanding operations.

     Minority interest share of net income reflects FCX's 80 percent
ownership interest in PT-FI for 1992, compared with its 90 percent interest
during 1991.

for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993 included
in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.'s annual report to shareholders
incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report
thereon dated January 25, 1994.  Our audits were made for the purpose of

a.    The footnotes contained in FCX's 1993 Annual Report to stockholders are
      an integral part of these statements.

b.    Effective December 31, 1991, PT-FI issued 21,300 of its shares,
      representing a 10 percent interest in PT-FI, to a publicly traded entity
      owned by Indonesian investors for $212.5 million, pursuant to an
      agreement negotiated in early 1991.  FCX guaranteed the buyer's
      financing for this purchase and accordingly, deferred the gain on the
      sale.

      In December 1992, FCX purchased approximately 49 percent of the capital
      stock of P.T.  Indocopper Investama Corporation (PTII), a publicly
      traded Indonesian entity which owned 10 percent of the outstanding
      common stock of PT-FI.  PTII acquired the 10 percent of the outstanding
      common stock of PT-FI from the Indonesian investors who acquired the
      shares on December 31, 1991.  When FCX recorded its investment in PTII
      it utilized purchase accounting and thus eliminated the deferred gain of
      $138.6 million on the original sale to the Indonesian investors against
      the cost of the 4.9 percent indirect interest in PT-FI.  The excess cost
      resulting from the purchase ($69.5 million) is reflected in FCX's
      consolidated balance sheet as property, plant and equipment and is being
      amortized over the remaining life of the Contract of Work (approximately
      28 years), at a rate of approximately $2.4 million per year.  This
      property, plant and equipment is included in the condensed balance sheet
      as part of FCX's investment in PTII.
