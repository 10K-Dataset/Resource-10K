GENERAL

We are a leading international mining company with headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. Our company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on November 10, 1987. We operate large, long-lived geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum, and we are one of the world’s largest publicly traded copper producers. Our portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits; and significant mining operations in North America and South America, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in Arizona and the Cerro Verde operation in Peru.

We believe that we have a high-quality portfolio of long-lived copper assets positioned to generate long-term value. PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) continues to advance several projects in the Grasberg minerals district related to the development of its large-scale, long-lived, high-grade underground ore bodies, and we are nearing completion of a project to develop the Lone Star leachable ores near the Safford operation in eastern Arizona, which is now approximately 75 percent complete. We are also pursuing other opportunities to enhance our mines’ net present values, and we continue to advance studies for future development of our copper resources, the timing of which will be dependent on market conditions.

During 2019, we advanced initiatives in our North America and South America mining operations to enhance productivity, expand margins and reduce the capital intensity of the business through the utilization of new technology applications in combination with a more interactive operating structure. The pilot program initiated at the Bagdad mine in northwest Arizona in late 2018 was successful in utilizing data science, machine learning and integrated functional teams to address bottlenecks, provide cost benefits and drive improved overall performance. The program is now being implemented across our North America and South America operations.

During fourth-quarter 2019, PT-FI completed mining the final phase of the Grasberg open pit and continues to achieve important milestones in ramping-up production of large-scale quantities of copper and gold from its significant underground ore bodies. In aggregate, the Grasberg open pit produced over 27 billion pounds of copper and 46 million ounces of gold in the 30-year period from 1990 through 2019. As PT-FI continues to ramp-up production from its underground ore bodies, our consolidated metal production is expected to improve significantly by 2021.

COPPER, GOLD AND MOLYBDENUM

Following is a brief discussion of our primary natural resources – copper, gold and molybdenum. For further discussion of historical and current market prices of these commodities, refer to MD&A and Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Copper

Copper is an internationally traded commodity, and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the London Metal Exchange (LME), New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Shanghai Futures Exchange. Prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand, and can be volatile and cyclical. During


, the LME copper settlement price averaged

$2.72

per pound, ranging from a low of

$2.51

per pound to a high of

$2.98

per pound, and was

$2.79

per pound at

December 31, 2019

.

In general, demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth, particularly in industrial production and construction. According to Wood Mackenzie, a widely followed independent metals market consultant, copper’s end-use markets (and their estimated shares of total consumption) are construction (28 percent), electrical applications (28 percent), consumer products (21 percent), transportation (12 percent) and industrial machinery (11 percent). We believe copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for energy efficiencies, to advance communications and to enhance public health. Examples of areas we believe will require additional copper in the future include: (i) high efficiency motors, which consume up to 75 percent more copper than a standard motor; (ii) electric vehicles, which consume up to four times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar size with an internal combustion engine, and require copper-intensive charging station infrastructure to refuel; and (iii) renewable energy such as wind and solar, which consume four to five times the amount of copper compared to traditional fossil fuel generated power.



Gold

Gold is used for jewelry, coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications. Gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world. Benchmark prices are generally based on London Bullion Market Association (London) quotations. During


, the London PM gold price averaged

$1,393

per ounce, ranging from a low of

$1,270

per ounce to a high of

$1,546

per ounce, and was

$1,515

per ounce on December 30, 2019 (there was no London PM gold price quote on

December 31, 2019

).

Molybdenum

Molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemical-grade products used in catalysts, lubrication, smoke suppression, corrosion inhibition and pigmentation. Molybdenum, as a high-purity metal, is also used in electronics such as flat-panel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace. Reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications, including

Metals Week, CRU Report

and

Metal Bulletin

. During


, the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by

Metals Week

PRODUCTS AND SALES

Our consolidated revenues for


primarily included sales of copper (

79 percent

), gold (

11 percent

) and molybdenum (

8 percent

). Copper concentrate sales to PT Smelting (PT-FI’s 25-percent-owned copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia) totaled

13 percent

of our consolidated revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, and

12 percent

for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which is the only customer that accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues during the three years ended

December 31, 2019

. Refer to Note


for a summary of our consolidated revenues and operating income (loss) by business segment and geographic area.

Copper Products

We are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate, cathode and continuous cast copper rod. During


,

56 percent

of our mined copper was sold in concentrate,

22 percent

as cathode and

22 percent

as rod from our North America operations. The copper ore from our mines is generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) as described below.

Copper Concentrate

. We produce copper concentrate at six of our mines in which mined ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20 to 30 percent. In North America, copper concentrate is produced at the Morenci, Bagdad, Sierrita and Chino mines, and a significant portion is shipped to our Miami smelter in Arizona for further processing. Copper concentrate is also produced at the Cerro Verde mine in Peru and the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia.

Copper Cathode

. We produce copper cathode at our electrolytic refinery located in El Paso, Texas, and at nine of our mines.

SX/EW cathode is produced from the Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita, Miami, Chino and Tyrone mines in North America, and from the Cerro Verde and El Abra mines in South America

.

For ore subject to the SX/EW process, the ore is placed on stockpiles and copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulphuric acid solution. The copper content of the solution is increased in two additional SX stages, and then the copper-bearing solution undergoes an EW process to produce cathode that is, on average, 99.99 percent copper. Our copper cathode is used as the raw material input for copper rod, brass mill products and for other uses.

Copper cathode is also produced at Atlantic Copper (our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in Spain) and PT Smelting. Copper concentrate is smelted (

i.e.

, subjected to extreme heat) to produce copper anode, which weighs between 800 and 900 pounds and has an average copper content of 99.5 percent. The anode is further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathode, which weighs between 100 and 350 pounds and has an average copper content of 99.99 percent. Refer to “Mining Operations - Smelting Facilities and Other Mining Properties” for further discussion of Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting.

Continuous Cast Copper Rod

. We manufacture continuous cast copper rod at our facilities in El Paso, Texas; Norwich, Connecticut; and Miami, Arizona, primarily using copper cathode produced at our North America copper mines.



Copper Sales

North America

. The majority of the copper produced at our North America copper mines and refined in our El Paso, Texas refinery is consumed at our rod plants to produce copper rod which is sold to wire and cable manufacturers. The remainder of our North America copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate under U.S. dollar-denominated annual contracts. Cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX - a division of NYMEX) monthly average settlement price for the month of shipment and include a premium. Generally, copper cathode is sold to rod, brass or tube fabricators. During


,

23 percent

of our North America mines’ copper concentrate sales volumes were shipped to Atlantic Copper for smelting and refining and sold as copper anode and copper cathode.

South America

.

Production from our South America mines is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under U.S. dollar-denominated, annual and multi-year contracts. During


, our South America mines sold approximately 77 percent of their copper production in concentrate and 23 percent as cathode.

Substantially all of our South America copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted LME monthly average settlement copper prices. Revenues from our South America concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties and treatment charges (

i.e.,

fees paid to smelters that are generally negotiated annually). In addition, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable from the smelting process, revenues from our South America concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances for unrecoverable metals, which are a negotiated term of the contracts and vary by customer.

Indonesia

.

PT-FI sells its production in the form of copper concentrate, which contains significant quantities of gold and silver, primarily under U.S. dollar-denominated, long-term contracts. PT-FI also sells a small amount of copper concentrate in the spot market. Following is a summary of PT-FI’s aggregate percentage of concentrate sales to unaffiliated third parties, PT Smelting and Atlantic Copper for the years ended December 31:

Substantially all of PT-FI’s concentrate sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted LME monthly average settlement copper prices. Revenues from PT-FI’s concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties, export duties, treatment charges and allowances for unrecoverable metals.

Gold Products and Sales

We produce gold almost exclusively from the Grasberg minerals district. The gold we produce is primarily sold as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes, which are a product of the smelting and refining process. Gold generally is priced at the average London price for a specified month near the month of shipment. Revenues from gold sold as a component of our copper concentrate are recorded net of treatment and refining charges, royalties, export duties and allowances for unrecoverable metals. Revenues from gold sold in slimes are recorded net of refining charges.

Molybdenum Products and Sales

We are the world’s largest producer of molybdenum and molybdenum-based chemicals. In addition to production from the Henderson and Climax molybdenum mines, we produce molybdenum concentrate at certain of the North America copper mines and the Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru. The majority of our molybdenum concentrate is processed in our own conversion facilities. Our molybdenum sales are primarily priced based on the average published

Metals Week

price for the month prior to the month of shipment.

and


.

COMPETITION

The top 10 producers of copper comprise approximately 43 percent of total worldwide mined copper production. We currently rank fourth among those producers, with approximately five percent of estimated total worldwide mined copper production. Our competitive position is based on the size, quality and grade of our ore bodies and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers. We have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures. Our costs are driven by the location, grade and nature of our ore bodies, and the level of input costs, including energy, labor and equipment. The metals markets are cyclical, and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits, hire and retain a skilled workforce, and to manage our costs.



MINING OPERATIONS

Following are maps and descriptions of our mining operations in North America (including both copper and molybdenum operations), South America and Indonesia.

North America

In the U.S., most of the land occupied by our copper and molybdenum mines, concentrators, SX/EW facilities, smelter, refinery, rod mills, molybdenum roasters and processing facilities is owned by us or is located on unpatented mining claims owned by us. Certain portions of our Bagdad, Sierrita, Miami, Chino, Tyrone, Henderson and Climax operations are located on government-owned land and are operated under a Mine Plan of Operations or other use permit. We hold various federal and state permits or leases on government land for purposes incidental to mine operations.

Morenci

We own a 72 percent undivided interest in Morenci, with the remaining 28 percent owned by Sumitomo Metal Mining Arizona, Inc. (15 percent) and SMM Morenci, Inc. (13 percent). Each partner takes in kind its share of Morenci’s production.

Morenci is an open-pit copper mining complex that has been in continuous operation since 1939 and previously was mined through underground workings. Morenci is located in Greenlee County, Arizona, approximately 50 miles northeast of Safford on U.S. Highway 191. The site is accessible by a paved highway and a railway spur.

The Morenci mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has oxide, secondary sulfide and primary sulfide mineralization. The predominant oxide copper mineral is chrysocolla. Chalcocite is the most important secondary copper sulfide mineral, with chalcopyrite as the dominant primary copper sulfide.

The Morenci operation consists of two concentrators capable of milling 132,000 metric tons of ore per day, which produce copper and molybdenum concentrate; a 68,000 metric ton-per-day, crushed-ore leach pad and stacking system; a low-grade run-of-mine (ROM) leaching system; four SX plants; and three EW tank houses that produce copper cathode. Total EW tank house capacity is approximately 900 million pounds of copper per year. Morenci’s available mining fleet consists of one hundred and forty-one 236-metric ton haul trucks loaded by 13 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 47 to 57 cubic meters, which are capable of moving an average of 815,000 metric tons of material per day.

The Morenci operation encompasses approximately 69,500 acres, comprising 51,300 acres of fee lands and 18,200 acres of unpatented mining claims held on public mineral estate and numerous state or federal permits, easements and rights-of-ways.



The Morenci operation’s electrical power is primarily sourced from Tucson Electric Power Company, Arizona Public Service Company and the Luna Energy facility in Deming, New Mexico. Although we believe the Morenci operation has sufficient water sources to support current operations, we are a party to litigation that may impact our water right claims or rights to continued use of currently available water supplies, which could adversely affect our water supply for the Morenci operation. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” for further discussion.

Bagdad

Our wholly owned Bagdad mine is an open-pit copper and molybdenum mining complex located in Yavapai County in west-central Arizona. It is approximately 60 miles west of Prescott and 100 miles northwest of Phoenix. The property can be reached by Arizona Highway 96, which ends at the town of Bagdad. The closest railroad is at Hillside, Arizona, 24 miles southeast on Arizona Highway 96. The open-pit mining operation has been ongoing since 1945, and prior mining was conducted through underground workings.

The Bagdad mine is a porphyry copper deposit containing both sulfide and oxide mineralization. Chalcopyrite and molybdenite are the dominant primary sulfides and are the primary economic minerals in the mine. Chalcocite is the most common secondary copper sulfide mineral, and the predominant oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla, malachite and azurite.

The Bagdad operation consists of an 81,600 metric ton-per-day concentrator that produces copper and molybdenum concentrate, a SX/EW plant that will produce approximately 5 million pounds per year of copper cathode from solution generated by low-grade stockpile leaching, and a pressure-leach plant to process molybdenum concentrate. The available mining fleet consists of thirty-seven 235-metric ton haul trucks loaded by six shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 to 48 cubic meters, which are capable of moving an average of 250,000 metric tons of material per day.

Miami

Our wholly owned Miami mine is an open-pit copper mining complex located in Gila County, Arizona, 90 miles east of Phoenix and 6 miles west of the city of Globe on U.S. Highway 60. The site is accessible by a paved highway and by rail.

The Miami mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has leachable oxide and secondary sulfide mineralization. The predominant oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla, copper-bearing clays, malachite and azurite. Chalcocite and covellite are the most important secondary copper sulfide minerals.

Since about 1915, the Miami mining operation had processed copper ore using both flotation and leaching technologies. The design capacity of the SX/EW plant is 200 million pounds of copper per year. Miami is no longer mining ore, but currently produces copper through leaching material already placed on stockpiles, which is expected to continue until 2025. Miami’s copper production totaled 15 million pounds in


, 16 million pounds in


and 19 million pounds in


.

Miami is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging 18 inches per year. The highest bench elevation is 1,390 meters above sea level and mining advanced the pit bottom to an elevation of 810 meters above sea level. Subsequent sloughing of material into the pit has filled it back to an elevation estimated to be 900 meters above sea level. The Miami operation encompasses approximately 14,700 acres, comprising 10,400 acres of fee lands and 4,300 acres of unpatented mining claims held on public mineral estate.

Miami receives electrical power through long-term contracts with the Salt River Project and natural gas through long-term contracts with El Paso Natural Gas as the transporter. We believe the Miami operation has sufficient water sources to support current operations.

South America

At our operations in South America, mine properties and facilities are controlled through mining claims or concessions under the general mining laws of the relevant country. The claims or concessions are owned or controlled by the operating companies in which we or our subsidiaries have a controlling ownership interest. Roads, power lines and aqueducts are controlled by easements.

Cerro Verde

We have a 53.56 percent ownership interest in Cerro Verde, with the remaining 46.44 percent held by SMM Cerro Verde Netherlands B.V. (21.0 percent), Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (19.58 percent) and other stockholders whose shares are publicly traded on the Lima Stock Exchange (5.86 percent).

Cerro Verde is an open-pit copper and molybdenum mining complex that has been in operation since 1976 and is located 20 miles southwest of Arequipa, Peru. The site is accessible by paved highway. Cerro Verde’s copper cathode and concentrate production that is not sold locally is transported approximately 70 miles by truck and by rail to the Port of Matarani for shipment to international markets.

The Cerro Verde mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has oxide, secondary sulfide and primary sulfide mineralization. The predominant oxide copper minerals are brochantite, chrysocolla, malachite and copper “pitch.” Chalcocite and covellite are the most important secondary copper sulfide minerals. Chalcopyrite and molybdenite are the dominant primary sulfides.

Cerro Verde’s operation consists of an open-pit copper mine, a 409,500 metric ton-per-day concentrating facility, and SX/EW leaching facilities. Leach copper production is derived from a 39,000 metric ton-per-day crushed leach facility and a 100,000 metric ton-per-day ROM leach system. This SX/EW leaching operation has a capacity of approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year.

The available fleet consists of forty-five 290-metric ton haul trucks and ninety-three 230-metric ton haul trucks loaded by twelve electric shovels with bucket sizes ranging in size from 33 to 57 cubic meters and two hydraulic shovels with a bucket size of 21 cubic meters.

Cerro Verde is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging 1.5 inches per year and is in an active seismic zone. The highest bench elevation is 2,750 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1,553 meters above sea level. The Peru general mining law and Cerro Verde’s mining stability agreement grant the surface rights of mining concessions located on government land. Government land obtained after 1997 must be leased or purchased. Cerro Verde has a mining concession covering approximately 182,000 acres, including access to 14,600 acres granted through an easement from the Peru National Assets Office, plus 145 acres of owned property, and 1,151 acres of rights-of-way outside the mining concession area.

Cerro Verde receives electrical power, including hydro-generated power, under long-term contracts with Kallpa Generación SA, ElectroPeru and Engie Energia Peru S.A.

Water for our Cerro Verde processing operations comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation. We believe the Cerro Verde operation has sufficient water resources to support current operations. For further discussion of risks associated with the availability of water, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

El Abra

We own a 51 percent interest in El Abra, and the remaining 49 percent interest is held by the state-owned copper enterprise Corporación Nacional del Cobre de Chile (CODELCO).

El Abra is an open-pit copper mining complex that has been in operation since 1996 and is located 47 miles north of Calama in Chile’s El Loa province, Region II. The site is accessible by paved highway and by rail.

The El Abra mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has sulfide and oxide mineralization. The predominant primary sulfide copper minerals are bornite and chalcopyrite. There is a minor amount of secondary sulfide mineralization

as chalcocite. The oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla and pseudomalachite. There are lesser amounts of copper-bearing clays and tenorite.

The El Abra operation consists of an open-pit copper mine and a SX/EW facility with a capacity of 500 million pounds of copper cathode per year from a 125,000 metric ton-per-day crushed leach circuit and a similar-sized ROM leaching operation. The available fleet consists of twenty-three 242-metric ton haul trucks loaded by four shovels with buckets ranging in size from 29 to 41 cubic meters, which are capable of moving an average of 216,000 metric tons of material per day.

180 million

pounds in


,

200 million

pounds in


and

173 million

pounds in


.

We continue to evaluate a large-scale expansion at El Abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries. El Abra’s large sulfide resource could potentially support a major mill project similar to facilities constructed at Cerro Verde. Technical and economic studies continue to be advanced to determine the optimal scope and timing for the project.



El Abra is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone. The highest bench elevation is 4,195 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 3,385 meters above sea level. El Abra controls a total of approximately 180,000 acres of mining claims covering the ore deposit, stockpiles, process plant, and water wellfield and pipeline. In addition, El Abra has land surface rights for the road between the processing plant and the mine, the water wellfield, power transmission lines and for the water pipeline from the Salar de Ascotán aquifer.

El Abra currently receives electrical power under a long-term contract with Engie Energia Chile S.A. Water for our El Abra processing operations comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán aquifer pursuant to regulatory approval. We believe El Abra has sufficient water rights and regulatory approvals to support current operations. For a discussion of risks associated with the availability of water, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Indonesia

Ownership

. PT-FI is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Republic of Indonesia. On December 21, 2018, we completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership (refer to Note 2 for further discussion). Following the transaction, we have a 48.76 percent share ownership in PT-FI and the remaining 51.24 percent share ownership is collectively held by PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminum (Persero) (PT Inalum), an Indonesia state-owned enterprise, and PT Indonesia Papua Metal Dan Mineral (formerly known as PT Indocopper Investama), which is expected to be owned by PT Inalum and the provincial/regional government in Papua, Indonesia. The arrangements related to the transaction also provide for us and the other pre-transaction PT-FI shareholders to retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture. As a result, our economic interest in PT-FI is expected to approximate 81 percent through 2022.

IUPK

. Concurrent with closing the transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI a new special mining license (IUPK) to replace its former Contract of Work (COW), enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI has been granted an extension of mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend mining rights through 2041, subject to PT-FI completing the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia within five years of closing the transaction and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government. The IUPK, and related documentation, contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041. In addition, we, as a foreign investor, have rights to resolve investment disputes with the Indonesia government through international arbitration. Refer to Note 13 and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for discussion of PT-FI’s IUPK and risks associated with our Indonesia mining operations.



On September 12, 2019, PT-FI received approval from the Indonesia government to increase its export quota from approximately 180,000 dry metric tons (DMT) of concentrate to approximately 680,000 DMT for the current export period, which expires March 8, 2020. Export licenses are valid for one year periods, subject to review and approval by the Indonesia government every six months, depending on smelter construction progress.

Grasberg Minerals District

.  PT-FI operates in the remote highlands of the Sudirman Mountain Range in the province of Papua, Indonesia, which is on the western half of the island of New Guinea. Since 1967, we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in the approximately 24,600-acre operating area. The operating area is accessible by portsite facilities (Arafura Sea) and by the Timika airport. The project area includes a 70-mile main service road from portsite to the mill complex.

After mining the final phase of the Grasberg open pit during 2019, the Grasberg minerals district includes the following underground mines that are being operated or in advanced development; the Grasberg Block Cave, the Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ), Big Gossan and the Deep Ore Zone (DOZ).

As further discussed in MD&A, PT-FI is ramping-up production from its significant underground ore bodies and continues to achieve important milestones to produce large-scale quantities of copper and gold. In aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to produce large-scale quantities of copper and gold. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for discussion of risks associated with development projects and underground mines.

Production from the Grasberg minerals district, including the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture share, totaled

0.6 billion

pounds of copper and

0.9 million

ounces of gold in


,

1.2 billion

pounds of copper and

2.7 million

ounces of gold in


, and

1.0 billion

pounds of copper and

1.6 million

ounces of gold in


.

Our principal source of power for all of our Indonesia operations is a coal-fired power plant that we built in 1998. Diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity. A combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations. Our Indonesia operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches.

Grasberg Open Pit

PT-FI began open-pit mining of the Grasberg ore body in 1990. The final phase of the Grasberg open pit was mined during 2019, including the removal of the open pit ramps. In aggregate, the Grasberg open pit produced over 27 billion pounds of copper and 46 million ounces of gold in the 30-year period from 1990 through 2019.

Ore milled from the Grasberg open pit averaged

60,100

metric tons per day in


,

133,300

metric tons per day in


and

101,800

metric tons per day in


.

Grasberg Block Cave

The Grasberg Block Cave ore body is the same ore body historically mined from the surface in the Grasberg open pit. Undercutting, drawbell construction and ore extraction activities in the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine continue to track expectations. Monitoring data on cave propagation in the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine is providing confidence in growing production rates over time. As existing drawpoints mature and additional drawpoints are added, cave expansion is expected to accelerate production rates to an average of 30,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2020, over 60,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021 and 130,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2023 from five production blocks spanning 335,000 square meters.

Ore milled from the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine averaged

8,600

metric tons per day in 2019,

4,000

metric tons per day in 2018 and

3,600

metric tons per day in 2017. Production at the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine is expected to continue through 2041.

The Grasberg Block Cave fleet consists of approximately 460 pieces of mobile equipment. The primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 52 LHD units and 35 haul trucks. Each production LHD unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore and transfer ore into 55 to 60 metric ton capacity haul trucks. In addition, the Grasberg Block Cave has a rail haulage system currently operating with 3 locomotives and 27 ore wagons that haul the ore to the first of the 3 planned gyratory crushers located underground via an automated rail system. Each ore wagon typically carries 30 metric tons.



DMLZ Underground Mine

The DMLZ ore body lies below the DOZ underground mine at the 2,590-meter elevation and represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the Ertsberg East Skarn system and neighboring Ertsberg porphyry.

The DMLZ has continued its ramp-up of production. Hydraulic fracturing operations have been effective in managing rock stresses and pre-conditioning the cave following mining-induced seismic activity experienced in 2017 and 2018. Ore extraction continues to exceed expectations, averaging

14,900

metric tons of ore per day in

fourth-quarter


and reached approximately 16,000 metric tons of ore per day at year-end 2019. Ongoing hydraulic fracturing operations combined with continued undercutting and drawbell openings in the two currently active production blocks are expected to expand the cave, supporting higher production rates that are expected to average 29,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2020, approach 60,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021 and 80,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2022 from three production blocks.

Ore milled from the DMLZ underground mine averaged

9,800

metric tons of ore per day in


, and

3,200

metric tons per day in both 2018 and 2017. Production at the DMLZ underground mine is expected to continue through 2041.

The DMLZ fleet consists of over 290 pieces of mobile equipment, which includes 22 LHD units and 9 haul trucks used in production and development activities.

Big Gossan Underground Mine

The Big Gossan ore body lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site. It is a tabular, near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1,200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters. The mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill. Stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level. Trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher. The crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a two-skip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt. The belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing.

Ore milled from the Big Gossan underground mine averaged 6,100 metric tons per day in 2019, 3,800 metric tons per day in 2018 and 600 metric tons per day in 2017. Production at the Big Gossan underground mine is expected to continue through 2041.

The Big Gossan fleet consists of over 88 pieces of mobile equipment, which includes 12 LHD units and 9 haul trucks used in development and production activities.

DOZ Underground Mine

The DOZ ore body lies vertically below the now depleted Intermediate Ore Zone. PT-FI began production from the DOZ ore body in 1989 using open-stope mining methods, but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the Grasberg open pit. Production resumed in 2000 using the block-cave method and is at the 3,110-meter elevation level.

The DOZ is a mature block-cave mine that previously operated at 80,000 metric tons of ore per day. Current operating rates from the DOZ underground mine are driven by the value of the incremental DOZ ore grade compared to the ore from the DMLZ and Grasberg Block Cave underground mines. Ore milled from the DOZ underground mine averaged

25,500

metric tons per day in 2019,

33,800

metric tons per day in 2018 and

31,200

metric tons per day in 2017. Production at the DOZ underground mine is expected to continue through 2022.

The DOZ fleet consists of 186 pieces of mobile equipment. The primary mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 40 LHD units and 19 haul trucks. The trucks dump into two gyratory crushers, and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing.



Description of Indonesia Ore Bodies

.

Our Indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions, the Grasberg monzodiorite and the Ertsberg diorite. The host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the Sudirman Range, and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them. The igneous-hosted ore bodies (the Grasberg Block Cave and portions of the DOZ) occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides, dominated by chalcopyrite and, to a lesser extent, bornite. The sedimentary-rock hosted ore bodies (portions of the DOZ and all of the Big Gossan) occur as “magnetite-rich, calcium/magnesian skarn” replacements, whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions.

The copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite, but higher bornite concentrations are common. Moreover, gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies, though rarely visible to the naked eye. These gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals, though, in some deposits, these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite.

The following diagram indicates the relative elevations (in meters) of our reported Indonesia ore bodies.



The following map, which encompasses an area of 42 square kilometers (16 square miles), indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported Indonesia ore bodies and their locations.

Smelting Facilities and Other Mining Properties

Atlantic Copper

. Our wholly owned Atlantic Copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the Huelva, Spain, port authorities, which are scheduled to expire in 2039.

The design capacity of the smelter is approximately 300,000 metric tons of copper per year, and the refinery has a capacity of 286,000 metric tons of copper per year. Atlantic Copper produced 272,000 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 268,300 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in


; 295,300 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 283,100 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2018; and 283,100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 271,400 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2017.

Following is a summary of Atlantic Copper’s concentrate purchases from unaffiliated third parties and our copper mining operations for the years ended December 31:

Atlantic Copper’s major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years, with shorter-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. Atlantic Copper completed a 79-day major maintenance turnaround in 2013, a 16-day maintenance turnaround in 2015, a 27-day maintenance turnaround in 2017 and a 16-day maintenance turnaround in 2019. The next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2021.

PT Smelting

. PT-FI’s former COW required us to construct, or cause to be constructed, a smelter in Indonesia if we and the Indonesia government determined that such a project would be economically viable. In 1995, following the completion of a feasibility study, we entered into agreements relating to the formation of PT Smelting, an Indonesia company, and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia. PT Smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery. PT-FI owns 25 percent of PT Smelting, with the remainder owned by Mitsubishi



Materials Corporation (60.5 percent), Mitsubishi Corporation RtM Japan Ltd. (9.5 percent) and JX Nippon Mining & Metals Corporation (5 percent).

PT-FI’s contract with PT Smelting requires PT-FI to supply 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements (at market rates subject to a minimum or maximum treatment charge rate) necessary for PT Smelting to produce 205,000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis. PT-FI may also sell copper concentrate to PT Smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205,000 metric tons of copper annually. PT-FI supplied

90 percent

of PT Smelting’s concentrate requirements in both 2019 and 2018 and 93 percent in 2017.

In early 2017, the Indonesia government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals, including copper concentrate and anode slimes, and other matters related to the mining sector. These regulations permit the export of anode slimes, which is necessary for PT Smelting to continue operating. As a result of labor disturbances and a delay in the renewal of its export license for anode slimes, PT Smelting’s operations were shut down from mid-January 2017 until early March 2017. In March 2019, PT Smelting received a one-year extension of its anode slimes export license, which currently expires March 11, 2020. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion.

PT Smelting produced 246,100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 241,200 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in


; 258,800 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 257,600 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2018; and 245,800 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 247,800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2017.

PT Smelting’s maintenance turnarounds (which range from two weeks to a month to complete) typically are expected to occur approximately every two years, with short-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. PT Smelting completed a 30-day maintenance turnaround during 2018, and the next major turnaround is scheduled to start in November 2020.

Miami Smelter

. We own and operate a smelter at our Miami mining operation in Arizona. The smelter has been operating for over 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies, improve production and comply with air quality requirements. In 2018, the Miami smelter completed the installation of emission control equipment that allows it to operate in compliance with current air quality standards. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion.

The Miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our North America copper mines. Concentrate processed through the smelter totaled 641,000 metric tons in


, 729,900 metric tons in 2018 and 612,600 metric tons in 2017. In addition, because sulphuric acid is a by-product of smelting concentrate, the Miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our North America leaching operations.

Major maintenance turnarounds (which take approximately three weeks to complete) are anticipated to occur approximately every two years for the Miami smelter. The Miami smelter completed a major maintenance turnaround in the first half of 2019, and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2021.

Rod & Refining Operations

. Our Rod & Refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in North America, including a refinery in El Paso, Texas; rod mills in El Paso, Texas, Norwich, Connecticut, and Miami, Arizona; and a specialty copper products facility in Bayway, New Jersey. We refine our copper anode production from our Miami smelter at our El Paso refinery. The El Paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode, which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at our Miami smelter. Our El Paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate, copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold, silver, platinum and palladium.

Molybdenum Conversion Facilities

. We process molybdenum concentrate at our conversion plants in the U.S. and Europe into such products as technical-grade molybdic oxide, ferromolybdenum, pure molybdic oxide, ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide. We operate molybdenum roasters in Sierrita, Arizona; Fort Madison, Iowa; and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and we operate a molybdenum pressure-leach plant in Bagdad, Arizona. We also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in Stowmarket, United Kingdom.



Freeport Cobalt

. In March 2013, we acquired a cobalt chemical refinery in Kokkola, Finland, and the related sales and marketing business which provided direct end-market access for the cobalt hydroxide production at the Tenke Fungurume mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which we held an interest prior to our sale of TF Holdings Limited in 2016. We, as operator, held an effective 56 percent ownership interest. The remaining effective ownership interest was held by Lundin Mining Corporation (24 percent) and La Générale des Carrières et des Mines (20 percent). The Kokkola refinery has an annual refining capacity of approximately 15,000 metric tons of cobalt.

In fourth-quarter 2019, we completed the sale of the cobalt refinery and related cobalt cathode precursor business to Umicore. Under the terms of the agreement, we separated the cobalt business, and Umicore acquired the refinery and cathode precursor business, which represents approximately 60 percent of the refinery’s historical revenues. We and the current noncontrolling interest partners in Freeport Cobalt will retain the remaining cobalt business, which is a producer of cobalt fine powders, chemicals, catalysts, ceramics and pigments.

Refer to Note 2 for additional discussion of the disposition.

Other North America Copper Mines

. We also have five non-operating copper mines – Ajo, Bisbee, Tohono, Twin Buttes and Christmas, which are located in Arizona – that have been on care-and-maintenance status for several years and would require new or updated environmental studies, new permits, and additional capital investment, which could be significant, to return them to operating status.

Mining Development Projects and Exploration Activities

Capital expenditures for mining operations totaled

$2.65 billion

(including

$1.5 billion

for major projects) in


,

$2.0 billion

(including

$1.2 billion

for major projects) in


and $1.4 billion (including $0.9 billion for major projects) in


. Capital expenditures for major projects during


and


were primarily associated with underground development activities in the Grasberg minerals district and development of the Lone Star copper leach project. Capital expenditures for major projects during


were primarily associated with the Cerro Verde expansion project and underground development activities in the Grasberg minerals district. Refer to MD&A for projected capital expenditures for the year 2020.

We have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes, extend mine lives and develop large-scale underground ore bodies. As further discussed in MD&A, our near-term major development projects primarily include the underground development activities in the Grasberg minerals district and development of the Lone Star copper leach project, which is nearing completion. Considering the long-term nature and large size of our development projects, actual costs and timing could vary from estimates. Additionally, in response to market conditions, the timing of our expenditures will continue to be reviewed. We continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves.

PT-FI has also committed to construct a new smelter in Indonesia by December 21, 2023. Refer to MD&A for a discussion of the smelter project.

We also have an additional long-term underground mine development project in the Grasberg minerals district for the Kucing Liar ore body, which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the Grasberg open pit at the 2,605-meter elevation level. We expect to mine the Kucing Liar ore body using the block-cave method. Aggregate long-term capital cost estimates for development of the Kucing Liar ore body are projected to approximate $3.6 billion, and the timing of development is under review. Additionally, full development would require $5.7 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types. The timing of this project and trade-off studies are currently being reviewed.

Our mining exploration activities are generally associated with our existing mines focusing on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity. Exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in North America and South America. Exploration spending associated with mining operations totaled

$77 million

in


, $78 million in


and $72 million in


. Refer to MD&A for projected exploration expenditures for the year


.

Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion of risks associated with mine development projects and exploration activities, and PT-FI’s IUPK.



Sources and Availability of Energy, Natural Resources and Raw Materials

Our copper mining operations require significant amounts of energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. Energy represented approximately

20 percent

of our copper mine site operating costs in


, including purchases of approximately

230 million

gallons of diesel fuel;

8,200

gigawatt hours of electricity at our North America and South America copper mining operations (we generate all of our power at our Indonesia mining operation);

675 thousand

metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in Indonesia; and


million MMBtu (million British thermal units) of natural gas at certain of our North America mines. Based on current cost estimates, energy will approximate

20 percent

of our copper mine site operating costs in


.

Our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. The loss of water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights, could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations. For a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.”

Sulphuric acid is used in the SX/EW process and is produced as a by-product of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulfur burners at the Safford mine. Sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties.

Community and Human Rights

We have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and that are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations. We continue to make significant expenditures on community development, health, education, training and cultural programs, which include:

•

comprehensive job training programs

•

clean water and sanitation projects

•

public health programs, including malaria control and human immunodeficiency virus

•

agricultural assistance programs

•

small and medium enterprise development programs

•

basic education programs

•

cultural promotion and preservation programs

•

community infrastructure development

•

charitable donations

In December 2000, we endorsed the joint U.S. State Department-British Foreign Office Voluntary Principles on Human Rights and Security (Voluntary Principles). We participated in developing these Voluntary Principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy. The Voluntary Principles provide guidelines for our security programs, including interaction with host-government security personnel, private security contractors and our internal security employees.

Our human rights policy, most recently updated in August 2017, reflects our full commitment to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We have embarked on a program to plan and conduct site-level human rights impact assessments (HRIA) at our global operations.

HRIAs help us to embed human rights considerations into our business practices, including site-level sustainable development risk registers. We completed a HRIA at our Cerro Verde operation in Peru in 2017 and at our New Mexico mining operations in 2018. We also participate in a multi-industry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies.

We believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations. As part of our ongoing commitment to sustainable community development, we have made and expect to continue making investments in certain social programs, including in-kind support and administration, across our global operations from time to time. Over the last three years, these investments have averaged $136 million per year. Nevertheless, social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion.



South America

. Cerro Verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years. Following engagements with regional and local governments, civic leaders and development agencies, in 2006, Cerro Verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve Arequipa. In addition, an agreement was reached with the Peru government for development of a water storage network that was financed by Cerro Verde and a distribution network that was financed by the Cerro Verde Civil Association.

Cerro Verde reached an agreement with the Regional Government of Arequipa, the National Government, the local water utility company and other local institutions to allow it to finance, engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of Arequipa, which was completed in 2015. The wastewater treatment plant supplements existing water supplies to support Cerro Verde’s concentrator expansion and also improves the local water quality, enhances agriculture products grown in the area and reduces the risk of waterborne illnesses. In addition to these projects, Cerro Verde annually makes significant community development investments in the Arequipa region.

Security Matters

. Consistent with our operating permits in Peru and our commitment to protect our employees and property, we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment. As part of its security program, Cerro Verde maintains its own internal security department. Both employees and contractors perform functions such as protecting company facilities, monitoring shipments of supplies and products, assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations. The security department receives human rights and Voluntary Principles training annually. Some contractors assigned to protection of expatriate personnel are armed. These contractors also receive training in defensive driving and firearms handling. Cerro Verde’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled $9 million in 2019 and $8 million in both 2018 and 2017.

Cerro Verde, like all businesses and residents of Peru, relies on the Peru government for the maintenance of public order, upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property. The Peru government is responsible for employing police personnel and directing their operations. Cerro Verde has limited public security forces in support of its operation, with the arrangement defined through a memorandum of understanding with the Peru National Police. Cerro Verde’s share of support costs for government-provided security approximated $1 million in each of the years 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Indonesia

. In 1996, PT-FI established the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development (the Partnership Fund) through which PT-FI has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health, education, economic development and local infrastructure. PT-FI had committed through December 31, 2019, to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local communities in its area of operations through the Partnership Fund. Negotiations to extend this agreement are currently underway though PT-FI will continue its contributions to ensure there are no interruptions in the implementation of approved projects. PT-FI recorded costs of

$28 million

in


,

$55 million

in


and

$44 million

in


for this commitment.

Historically, the Amungme and Kamoro Community Development Organization (

Lembaga Pengembangan Masyarakat Amungme dan Kamoro

) oversaw disbursement of the program funds PT-FI contributed to the Partnership Fund. Throughout 2019, PT-FI consulted with key stakeholders to restructure the management of the Partnership Fund in compliance with PT-FI’s IUPK. Beginning in February 2020, the Partnership Fund is now managed by a legally recognized Indonesian foundation (

Yayasan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Amungme dan Kamoro

or YPMAK). YPMAK is governed by a Board of Governors consisting of seven representatives, including four from PT-FI.

In addition to the Partnership Fund, PT-FI has made and expects to continue making annual investments in public health, education, community infrastructure and local economic development.

Security Matters

.

Consistent with our ongoing commitment to protect our employees and property, we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment. As part of its security program, PT-FI maintains its own internal civilian security department. Both employees and contractors are unarmed and perform functions such as protecting company facilities, monitoring shipments of supplies and products, assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations. The security department receives human rights training annually.

PT-FI’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled

$52 million

in


,

$59 million

in


and

$54 million

.



PT-FI, like all businesses and residents of Indonesia, relies on the Indonesia government for the maintenance of public order, upholding the rule of law and protection of personnel and property. The Grasberg minerals district has been designated by the Indonesia government as one of Indonesia’s vital national assets. This designation results in the police, and to a lesser extent, the military, playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations. The Indonesia government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations.

From the outset of PT-FI’s operations, the Indonesia government has looked to PT-FI to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the Indonesia government and the remote location of and lack of development in Papua. PT-FI’s financial support of the Indonesia government security institutions assigned to PT-FI’s operations area represents a prudent response to PT-FI’s requirements and commitments to protect its workforce and property, and better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol PT-FI’s roads and secure its area of operations. In addition, the provision of such support is consistent with our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship, and reflects our commitment to pursue practices that respect human rights.

PT-FI’s support costs for the government-provided security totaled

$22 million

in


,

$27 million

in


and

$23 million

in


. This supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs, including food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs, allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs, and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police.

Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion of security risks in Indonesia.

Mineral Reserves

Proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry, as more fully discussed below. The term “reserve,” as used in the reserve data presented here, means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (i) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (ii) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (iii) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

Our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. We conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. We revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for discussion of risks associated with our estimates of proven and probable reserves.

Estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at

December 31, 2019

, were determined using metals price assumptions of

$2.50

per pound for copper,

$1,200

per ounce for gold and

$10

per pound for molybdenum.

For the three-year period ended

December 31, 2019

, LME copper settlement prices averaged

$2.83

per pound, London PM gold prices averaged

$1,306

per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by

Metals Week

averaged

$10.50

per pound.

The estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates, where applicable. Recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.

In defining our open-pit reserves, we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy. The objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations. We use a “break-even cutoff grade” to define the in-situ reserves for our underground ore bodies. The break-even cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade, once produced and sold, that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production.

Our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals, such as gold, molybdenum and silver. We value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade. Copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multi-metal ores in terms of one metal. The calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities, metals prices as used for reserve determination, recovery rates, treatment charges and royalties. Our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade.

The table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of

December 31, 2019

:



Drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals, such as geologists and geological engineers, in determining the suitability of data coverage (on a relative basis) in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate. Drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification. Drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit.

The following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type:



Production Sequencing

The following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body and related stockpiles. Our proven and probable ore reserves in Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that PT-FI will comply with its obligations under the IUPK and receive the second 10-year extension from 2031 through 2041 (refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Note 13 for further discussion). Production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life. The sequencing dates shown in the chart below include development activity that results in metal production. The ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors, including the results of our exploration and development efforts, and may vary from the dates shown below. In addition, we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies. Significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the life-of-mine plans reflected below.

Mill and Leach Stockpiles

Mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for metal recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating, smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities.

Because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles.



Expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately.

Expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. Processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes.

Following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of

December 31, 2019

:

a.

Rounds to less than 0.1 billion pounds of recoverable copper.

b.

Does not foot because of rounding.

Consolidated stockpiles represent estimated metal quantities after reduction for Morenci’s joint venture partner interests. Refer to Note


for further discussion.

d.

Net equity interest represents estimated consolidated metal quantities further reduced for noncontrolling interest ownership (refer to Note


for further discussion of our ownership in subsidiaries).

Mineralized Material

We hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant. However, permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties. Mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and/or underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades. Such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs, unit costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors. Estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of

$3.00

per pound for copper,

$1,200

per ounce for gold,

$12

per pound for molybdenum and $20 per ounce for silver. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for discussion of risks associated with our estimates of mineralized material.



a.

Amounts may not equal the sum of milling and leach material because of rounding.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

This report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of United States (U.S.) federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as plans, projections or expectations relating to ore grades and milling rates; production and sales volumes; unit net cash costs; operating cash flows; capital expenditures; our expectations regarding our share of PT Freeport Indonesia’s (PT-FI) net (loss) income and future cash flows through 2022; PT-FI’s development, financing, construction and completion of a new smelter in Indonesia; our expectations regarding results associated with productivity and innovation initiatives; exploration efforts and results; development and production activities, rates and costs; liquidity; tax rates; export quotas and duties; the impact of copper, gold and molybdenum price changes; the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings; reserve estimates; execution of the settlement agreement associated with the Louisiana coastal erosion cases; and future dividend payments, share purchases and sales.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, expected, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the following:

Financial risks

Fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper, gold and molybdenum, have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our common stock and debt. Extended declines in the market prices of copper, gold and, to a lesser extent, molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and asset values and, if sustained, may adversely affect our ability to repay debt.

Our financial results will vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper and gold, and to a lesser extent molybdenum. An extended decline in market prices of these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, the value of our assets and/or our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations; and may depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities.

Additionally, if market prices for our primary commodities decline for a sustained period of time, we may have to revise our operating plans, including curtailing production, reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs. We may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, in which case we may incur losses, and those losses may be material.

Fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control, including global supply and demand balances and inventory levels; global economic and political conditions; international regulatory, trade and tax policies, including national tariffs; commodities investment activity and speculation; interest rates; the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies; the price and availability of substitute products; and changes in technology. Volatility in global economic growth, particularly in developing economies, has the potential to adversely affect future demand and prices for commodities. Geopolitical uncertainty, including the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit), and protectionism, have the potential to inhibit international trade and negatively impact business confidence, which creates the risk of constraints on our ability to trade in certain markets and has the potential to increase price volatility.

Copper prices may be affected by demand from China, which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world, and by changes in demand for industrial, commercial and residential products containing copper. China’s economy continues to struggle with rising debt levels, softening domestic consumer demand, the effects of a prolonged trade war, and more recently, the coronavirus outbreak, which has led to the temporary closure of some manufacturing activities in China. Although our sales to date have not been significantly affected, a continued slowing in China’s economic growth, the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, changes in China-U.S. relations, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies are difficult to predict and could adversely affect copper prices, demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.



Copper prices have fluctuated historically, with London Metal Exchange (LME) copper settlement prices ranging from

$2.48

per pound to

$3.29

per pound during the three years ended

$2.79

per pound on

December 31, 2019

, and

$2.53

per pound on

Factors affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the U.S. dollar to other currencies, inflation and interest rate expectations, purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks, demand from China and India, two of the world

’

s largest consumers of gold, and global demand for jewelry containing gold. The London PM gold price averaged

$1,393

per ounce in 2019, $1,268 per ounce in 2018 and $1,257 per ounce in 2017. The London PM gold price was

$1,515

per ounce on December 30, 2019 (there was no London PM gold price quote on

December 31, 2019

Declines in prices of commodities we sell could result in metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our long-lived assets. Refer to Note


for additional information regarding metals inventory adjustments. Other events that could result in impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might have a material adverse effect on current and future expected mine production costs.

Our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.

, our total consolidated debt was $

9.8 billion

(see Note


) and our total consolidated cash was

$2.0 billion

. We also have various other financial commitments, including reclamation and environmental obligations, take-or-pay contracts and leases. For further information, refer to the risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations, and plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties. Although we have been successful in repaying debt in the past and issuing new debt securities in capital markets transactions, there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. In addition, we may assume additional debt in future periods or reduce our holdings of cash and cash equivalents in connection with funding existing operations, capital expenditures, dividends or in pursuing other business opportunities.

Our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including the following:

•

Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;

•

Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

Limiting our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and/or material contingencies, to engage in future development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt;

•

Requiring us to sell assets to reduce debt; or

•

Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments.

Any failure to comply with the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt agreements. Our available cash and liquidity may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that may be accelerated upon an event of default.

As of

January 31, 2020

, our senior unsecured debt was rated “BB“ with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s (S&P), “BB+” with a stable outlook by Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and “Ba1” with a stable outlook by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). If we are unable to maintain our indebtedness and financial ratios at levels acceptable to these credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects deteriorate

,

our current credit ratings could be



downgraded, which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities and existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms and could increase our borrowing costs.

Certain of our debt agreements, including our revolving credit facility, use the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a reference rate. In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021, which could cause market volatility or disruption. If LIBOR is unavailable after 2021, our debt with interest rates that are indexed to LIBOR will be determined using various alternative methods to the extent provided for in our agreements, which could result in increases in interest rates on such debt. Further, we may need to renegotiate our debt agreements and the loans that utilize LIBOR to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established by the U.S. Alternative Rate Reference Committee, which is currently expected to be the Secured Overnight Bank Financing Rate. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms, or the establishment of alternative reference rates on our borrowing costs or the capital markets generally

.

Mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations. We also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties, and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those properties.

Changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.

We are required by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so. Most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction, depending on how each state regulates land use and groundwater quality. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or similar state laws. Refer to Note


for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations.

We are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our remaining oil and gas properties under both state and federal laws, including financial responsibility required under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill. In 2016, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued revised requirements for lessees operating in federal waters to secure the cost of plugging, abandoning, decommissioning and/or removing wells, platforms and pipelines at the end of production. The revised requirements eliminate previously provided waivers from requirements to post security. In early 2017, the BOEM announced a delay in the implementation of certain aspects of the rules pending further review and in June 2017, BOEM further extended the start date for implementation indefinitely. This extension currently remains in effect. If implemented, the new requirements could require us to post security in the form of bonds or similar assurances. The cost for bonds or other forms of assurances can be substantial, and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases.

As of

December 31, 2019

, our financial assurance obligations totaled

$1.3 billion

for closure and reclamation/restoration costs of U.S. mining sites, and

$0.5 billion

for plugging and abandonment obligations of our remaining oil and gas properties. A substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by FCX and subsidiary guarantees and financial capability demonstrations. Our ability to continue to provide guarantees and financial capability demonstrations depends on state and other regulatory requirements, our financial performance and our financial condition. Other forms of assurance, such as letters of credit and surety bonds, are costly to provide and, depending on our financial condition and market conditions, may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties.

The laws and regulations governing mine closure and remediation in a particular jurisdiction and oil and gas properties plugging and abandonment obligations are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental and asset retirement obligations to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. Refer to Notes


and


, for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations.



Unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or with respect to other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.

We are involved in numerous legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues, including those described in Note


and in Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” involving matters such as remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, claims of personal injury or property damage arising from such contamination or from exposure to substances such as lead, arsenic, asbestos, talc and other allegedly toxic substances, disputes over water rights, and disputes with foreign governments or regulatory authorities over royalties, taxes, rights and obligations under concession or other agreements, or other matters. We are also involved periodically in other reviews, inquiries,

investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In addition, from time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at Superfund and other sites. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties, other sanctions or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period.

We may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to

our defined benefit pension plans.

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for certain current and former employees in the U.S. and a few pension plans for non-U.S. locations which provide for specified payments after retirement. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A sustained period of low or insufficient returns could require us to fund our pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. Refer to Note


for further discussion.

International risks

Our international operations are subject to political, economic, social and regional risks of doing business in countries outside the U.S.

We are a U.S.-based mining company with substantial assets located outside of the U.S. We conduct international mining operations in Indonesia, Peru and Chile and exploration activities in various foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the U.S., our business may be adversely affected by political, economic, social and regional uncertainties in each of these countries. Risks of conducting business in countries outside the U.S. include:

•

Delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, or the renegotiation, cancellation, revocation or forced modification of existing contracts, leases, licenses, permits or other agreements and/or approvals;

•

Expropriation or nationalization of property, protectionism, or restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital;

•

Changes in the host country’s laws, regulations and policies (which may be applied retroactively), including, but not limited to, those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, duties, tariffs, divestment, imports, exports (including restrictions on the export of copper concentrates, copper and/or gold), trade regulations, currency and environmental matters (including land use and water use), which because of rising “resource nationalism” in countries around the world, may impose increasingly onerous requirements on foreign operations and investment;



•

Political, social and economic instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil unrest, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;

•

Changes in the aspirations and expectations of local communities in which we operate with respect to our contributions to employee health and safety, infrastructure and community development and other factors that may affect our social license to operate, all of which lead to increased costs;

•

Risk of loss associated with trespass, local artisanal or illegal mining, theft and vandalism or due to potential pandemic and endemic health issues;

•

Changes in U.S. trade, tax, immigration or other policies that may harm relations with foreign countries or result in retaliatory policies;

•

Increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located;

•

Foreign exchange controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and inflation;

•

Reduced protection for intellectual property rights; and

•

The risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of an international court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation.

Our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks. Accordingly, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the U.S. may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.

Our international operations must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate. There has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws in recent years. We operate in jurisdictions that have experienced public and private sector corruption and where significant anti-corruption enforcement activities, prosecutions, and settlements have occurred. There can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable laws and internal policies, recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees, agents or contractors. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. Any violation of anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.

We are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with Indonesia and Peru tax authorities (refer to Note


for further discussion of these matters). Other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below.

Because our mining operations in Indonesia are a significant operating asset, our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in Indonesia.

Our Indonesia mining operations include the Grasberg minerals district, one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits. These operations are conducted by our subsidiary PT-FI pursuant to a special mining license (IUPK) issued by the Indonesia government. Refer to Note 13 for a summary of the IUPK’s key fiscal terms.

Maintaining a good working relationship with the Indonesia government is important because of the significance of our Indonesia operations to our business, and because our mining operations there are among Indonesia’s most significant business enterprises. The Grasberg minerals district has been designated by the Indonesia government as one of Indonesia’s vital national assets. Partially because of its significance to Indonesia’s economy, the environmentally sensitive area where it is located, and the number of people employed, our Indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the Indonesia press, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence.  Improper management of our working relationship with the Indonesia government could lead to a disruption of operations and/or impact our reputation in Indonesia and in the region



where we operate, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) (PT Inalum), a shareholder in PT-FI, is an Indonesia state-owned enterprise. Disputes between us and PT Inalum may result in litigation or arbitration, which could increase our expenses and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and could create tensions with the Indonesia government.

The Indonesia mining industry is subject to extensive regulation within Indonesia, and there have been major developments in laws and regulations applicable to mining concession holders, some of which have conflicted with PT-FI’s contractual rights in the past. In particular, the enactment of Law No. 4 of 2009 on Coal and Mineral Mining on January 12, 2009 (the Mining Law) replaced the previous regulatory framework which allowed concession holders, including PT-FI, to conduct mining activities in Indonesia under a contract of work system. The Mining Law, which sets out the regulatory framework for the mining industry in Indonesia, only contains substantive principles and leaves many specific issues to be addressed in implementing regulations, some of which have conflicted with PT-FI’s contractual rights in the past, including, but not limited to, regulations that imposed a progressive export duty on copper concentrate, restricted exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes, increased royalty rates, and required payment of a smelter assurance bond to support a commitment to construct a new smelter in Indonesia (refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the smelter assurance bond). In January 2017, PT-FI suspended exports through April 2017 in response to these Mining Law regulations.

The Mining Law stipulated that previously granted mining rights (through a contract of work) would continue to be valid until expiry, subject to certain adjustments. PT-FI’s former Contract of Work (COW) was concluded pursuant to the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which provided basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization, a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors. The initial term of PT-FI’s former COW was scheduled to expire in 2021 and explicitly provided that it could be extended for two 10-year periods subject to Indonesia government approval, which could not be withheld or delayed unreasonably. Prior to the issuance of the IUPK to PT-FI in December 2018, PT-FI had been engaged in discussions with the Indonesia government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its former COW, including extending its term. Notwithstanding provisions in PT-FI’s former COW prohibiting it from doing so, the Indonesia government sought to modify PT-FI’s former COW to address provisions contained in the Mining Law and implementing regulations adopted thereunder, some of which were not required under or conflicted with PT-FI’s former COW, including, but not limited to (i) restrictions on PT-FI’s basic right to export mining products; (ii) imposition of additional export duties and higher royalty rates; (iii) imposition of excess surface water taxes (refer to Note


); (iv) imposition of new requirement to build additional smelter capacity in Indonesia; (v) unreasonable withholding and delay in granting approval of two successive ten-year extensions of the term of the former COW; and (vi) imposition of new divestment requirements.

In early 2017, the Indonesia government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals, including copper concentrate and anode slimes, and other matters related to the mining sector. PT-FI’s export license for copper concentrate is valid for one year periods, subject to review and approval by the Indonesia government every six months, depending on smelter construction progress. PT-FI’s export license expires on March 8, 2020. The 2017 regulations also permit the export of anode slimes, which is necessary for PT Smelting (PT-FI’s 25-percent-owned copper smelter and refinery located in Gresik, Indonesia) to continue operating. PT Smelting’s export license for anode slimes expires on March 11, 2020.  In addition to a delay in the renewal of its export license for anode slimes in 2017, PT Smelting’s operations were shut down from mid-January 2017 until early March 2017 as a result of labor disturbances. Copper concentrate sales to PT Smelting totaled over 10 percent of our consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.  We cannot predict when PT-FI’s copper concentrate license and PT Smelting’s anode slimes export license may be renewed.   PT-FI’s sale of concentrates could be interrupted if either of these export license is not timely renewed or if PT Smelting is unable to operate either due to other operational or financial constraints, which would adversely impact our revenues and operations.

We cannot assure you that future regulatory changes affecting the mining industry in Indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly repealed, or that new interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not be issued, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



We will not mine all of PT-FI’s ore reserves in the Grasberg minerals district before the initial term of PT-FI’s IUPK expires in 2031 and the IUPK may not be extended through 2041 if PT-FI fails to abide by the terms and conditions of the IUPK and applicable laws and regulations.

On December 21, 2018, PT-FI was granted an IUPK to replace its former COW, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI has been granted mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend its mining rights through 2041, subject to, among other things, PT-FI completing the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia by December 21, 2023, and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government. Refer to Note 13 for a summary of the IUPK’s key fiscal terms.

The IUPK also requires PT-FI to pay duties on concentrate exports of 5 percent, declining to 2.5 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 30 percent, and eliminated when smelter development progress exceeds 50 percent. Smelter development progress will be determined by an independent verifier appointed by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) and subject to approval by the MEMR. Engineering and front-end engineering and design for the selected process technology are ongoing, with construction of the smelter expected to begin in 2020. The preliminary capital cost estimate for the project approximates $3 billion, and PT-FI is pursuing financing and commercial arrangements for this project. The economics of the new smelter will be borne by PT-FI’s shareholders according to their respective share ownership percentages. PT-FI’s ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future market prices as well as PT-FI’s operational performance, cash flow and debt position, among other factors. Financing may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to PT-FI.

Our proven and probable ore reserves in Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and PT-FI’s current long-term mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that PT-FI will abide by the terms and conditions of the IUPK and will be granted the 10-year extension from 2031 through 2041. As a result, we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the IUPK. Prior to the end of 2031, we expect to mine 52 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at

December 31, 2019

, representing 56 percent of our net equity share of recoverable copper reserves and 62 percent of our net equity share of recoverable gold reserves.

If PT-FI does not complete the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia by December 21, 2023, or fulfill its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government as set forth in the IUPK, the IUPK will likely not be extended from 2031 to 2041, and we would be unable to mine all of PT-FI’s ore reserves in the Grasberg minerals district, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.

Operational risks

Our mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business and our underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous.

Our mines are very large in scale and, by their nature are subject to significant operational risks, some of which are outside of our control, and many of which are not covered fully, or in some cases even partially, by insurance. These operational risks, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flow, include earthquakes, rainstorms, floods, and other natural disasters; environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals; surface or underground fires; equipment failures; accidents, including in connection with mining equipment, milling equipment or conveyor systems, transportation of chemicals, explosives or other materials and in the transportation of employees and business partners to and from sites; wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments; lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates; and unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form).

We are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of some of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. No assurances can be given that unanticipated geotechnical and hydrological conditions may or may not occur, nor whether these conditions may lead to events such as landslides and pit wall failures, in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as seismic activity or severe weather, which may lead to floods, mudslides, pit-wall instability, and possibly even slippage of material. During the first quarter of 2019, our El Abra operation in Chile experienced heavy rainfall and electrical storms. As a result, our operating results for 2019 were impacted by a suspension of El Abra’s crushed leach stacking operations



for approximately 35 days. We cannot predict whether similar events will occur in the future or the extent to which any such event would affect this, or any of our other operations.

For a discussion of risks specific to our tailings management, see below “

Our management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business.”

Underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous, and in May 2013, a tragic accident, which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries, occurred at PT-FI when the rock structure above the ceiling of an underground training facility collapsed. PT-FI temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the Grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed open-pit mining and concentrating activities in June 2013, and underground operations in July 2013. No assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future.

In addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our Indonesia mining operations involve additional

risks given their location in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of Indonesia. These conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. The area also receives extreme rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. Further, the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time.

We maintain insurance to cover some of these risks and hazards; however, our insurance may not sufficiently cover  losses from an unexpected natural or operating disaster. We maintain insurance in amounts that are believed to be reasonable depending on the circumstances surrounding the identified risk. No assurance can be given that such insurance will continue to be available, or that it will be available at economically feasible premiums, or that we will be able to obtain or maintain such insurance. In addition, we do not have coverage for certain environmental losses and other risks, as such coverage cannot be purchased at a commercially reasonable cost. The lack of, or insufficiency of, insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flow and overall profitability.

The occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development of and production from mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, significant repair costs, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, extensive community disruption, loss of licenses, permits or necessary approvals to operate, loss of infrastructure and services, disruption to essential supplies or delivery of our products, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.

Our management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business.

The waste rock (including overburden) and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste material. Managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks primarily relating to structural stability, geochemistry, water quality and dust generation. Management of this waste is regulated in the jurisdictions where we operate and our programs are designed to be in compliance with applicable national, state and local laws, permits and approved environmental impact studies.

We maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material, which are effectively large embankments that must be engineered, constructed and monitored to ensure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse. Our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions, and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations. In Indonesia, we use a river transport system for tailings management, which presents other risks discussed in more detail below under Environmental Risks - “

Our Indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations, could require us to incur increased costs

.”

Affiliates of our company currently operate 18 tailings storage facilities, 16 in the U.S. and 2 in Peru; and manage 58 in the U.S. that are inactive or closed (approximately three-fourths of the inactive facilities have been closed). Our inventory of tailings storage facilities comprises 13 active and 52 inactive or closed facilities with an upstream design, 5 active and 5 inactive with a centerline design, and 1 closed facility with a downstream design. In 2019, the Company produced approximately 309 million metric tons of tailings. The failure of tailings and other embankments



at any of our mining operations could cause severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life, as well as adverse effects on our business and reputation. Many of our tailings storage facilities are located in areas where a failure has the potential to impact individual dwellings and a limited number of impoundments are in areas where a failure has the potential to impact nearby communities or mining infrastructure. As a result, our programs take into account the significant consequences resulting from a potential failure, and we apply substantial financial resources and both internal and external technical resources to the safe management of all those facilities. Our tailings management and stewardship program, which involves qualified external Engineers of Record and periodic oversight by independent tailings Technical Review Boards and our Tailings Stewardship Team, complies with the tailings governance framework on preventing catastrophic failure of tailings storage facilities adopted in December 2016 by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and required to be implemented by ICMM members. We continue to enhance our existing practices and work with ICMM on additional initiatives to strengthen the design, operation and closure of tailings storage facilities in an effort to reduce the risk of severe or catastrophic failure of those facilities.  However, no assurance can be given that these events will not occur in the future.

The importance of careful design, management and monitoring of large impoundments has been emphasized in recent years by large scale tailings dam failures at unaffiliated mines, which resulted in numerous fatalities and caused extensive property and environmental damage. As a result of recent failures, international groups are drafting standards that management may elect to implement at our tailings storage facilities. These standards, if implemented, could require changes to our tailings stewardship program and approaches, although it is uncertain if these changes would result in material capital or operating cost increases.

Based on observations from such recent tailings failures, in addition to fatalities and severe personal, property and environmental damages, these events could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, decrease in reserves, legal liability (possibly involving the freezing of assets), government investigations, additional regulations and restrictions on mining operations in response to any such failure, increased monitoring costs and production costs, increased insurance costs or inability to obtain insurance, increased costs and/or limited access to capital, remediation costs, inability to comply with any additional safety requirements or obtain necessary certifications, evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action, and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.

Labor unrest, violence, activism and civil and religious strife could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately

37 percent

of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately

21 percent

of our global labor force was covered by agreements that have expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire during 2020.

Labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis, and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all. If we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers, we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors, our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected. Refer to Items 1. and 2. “Business and Properties” for additional information regarding labor matters, and expiration dates of such agreements.

We could experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, strikes, or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations. For example, during third-quarter 2016, PT-FI experienced labor productivity issues and a 10-day work stoppage that began in late September 2016. These labor productivity issues continued during fourth-quarter 2016 and the first half of 2017. Beginning in mid-April 2017, PT-FI experienced a high level of worker absenteeism, which unfavorably impacted mining and milling rates. A significant number of employees and contractors elected to participate in an illegal strike action beginning in May 2017, and were subsequently deemed to have voluntarily resigned under existing Indonesia laws and regulations resulting in increased costs associated with employee severance. We cannot predict whether additional labor disruptions will occur. Significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes or disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.



South American countries

have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability. During 2019, both Peru and Chile experienced significant and prolonged civil unrest unrelated to our operations. Production and sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were impacted by protests associated with an unaffiliated copper development project in Peru that blocked access to the shipping ports and main transportation routes. While the civil unrest did not significantly impact our results for 2019, if it continues, our South America operations could be materially impacted, and as a result, we may not be able to meet our production and sales targets. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents of civil unrest will occur in the future in Peru or Chile.

Indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. Several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of Papua, where our Grasberg minerals district is located. In Papua, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the Indonesia military and police. In addition, illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities. Social, economic and political instability in Papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our Indonesia operations.

In 2009, a series of shooting incidents occurred within the PT-FI project area, including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations. The shooting incidents continued on a sporadic basis through January 2015. During this time, there were 20 fatalities and more than 50 injuries to our employees, contractor employees, government security personnel and civilians. The next shooting incident occurred in August 2017, and a series of shooting incidents continued on a sporadic basis within the PT-FI project area and in nearby areas through January 2020, resulting in 2 fatalities and 25 injuries. In December 2018, a mass shooting incident targeting a highway construction crew occurred in a remote mountain area approximately 100 miles east of the PT-FI project area, resulting in at least 19 fatalities and several reported as missing. Separatist security incidents, including shootings, continue to be sporadically reported, and PT-FI continues to monitor the occurrence of incidents in the region.

The safety of our workforce is a critical concern, and PT-FI continues to work with the Indonesia government to address security issues within the PT-FI project area and in nearby areas. We continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys, including transport of personnel by armored vehicles in designated areas.

We cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our operations. If other disruptive incidents occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time.

Our mining operations depend on the availability of significant quantities of secure water supplies.

Our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities, and related support facilities. Most of our North America and South America mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant. Continuous production at our mines is dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies.

As discussed in Item 3. “Legal Proceedings,” in Arizona, where our operations use both surface and groundwater, we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which Arizona courts have been attempting, for over 40 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the Gila River, one of the state’s largest river systems. This stream adjudication primarily affects our Morenci, Safford and Sierrita mines. The adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users, including us, as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users. Groundwater is treated differently from surface water under Arizona law, which historically allowed landowners to pump subsurface water, subject only to the requirement of putting it to “reasonable use.” However, court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that some underground water constitutes “subflow” that is to be treated legally as surface water and is therefore subject to the Arizona doctrine of prior appropriation and subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims. Any re-characterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers, farmers, ranchers, municipalities, and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades. Because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in Arizona, we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings. Given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications, their long history, and their long-term legal, economic and



political implications, it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings. If we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications, our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed, and our operations at Morenci, Safford and Sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources.

Water for our Cerro Verde operation in Peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation. As a result of occasional drought conditions, temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our Cerro Verde operations.

Water for our El Abra mining operation in Chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán aquifer. In 2010, El Abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant, which began operations in 2011. The agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer level to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping. If impact occurs, we would have to reduce pumping to restore water levels, which could have an adverse effect on production from El Abra.

Although we typically have sufficient water for our Indonesia operations (the area receives considerable rainfall that has led to periodic floods and mudslides), lower rainfall could affect our water supply availability from time to time.

Although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands, as discussed above, some supplies are subject to adjudication proceedings, the outcome of which we cannot predict, and the availability of additional supplies that may be required for potential future expansions is uncertain. While we are taking actions to acquire additional back-up water supplies, such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost, or at all, so that the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations.

Development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business. The development of our underground mines and operations are also subject

to other unique risks.

Mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. Currently, our major projects include underground development activities in the Grasberg minerals district, which currently constitutes approximately

31 percent

of our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves, and completion of the Lone Star copper leach project in Arizona. There are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including, but not limited to, unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions, potential delays, cost overruns, lower levels of production during ramp-up periods, shortages of material or labor, construction defects, breakdowns and injuries to persons and property. The development of our underground mines and operations are also subject to other unique risks including, but not limited to, underground fires or floods, ventilating harmful gases, fall-of-ground accidents, and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions. While we anticipate taking all measures that we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with the development of our underground mines to safely manage production, there is no assurance that these risks will not cause schedule delays, revised mine plans, injuries to persons and property, or increased capital costs, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning, approval and review processes, many of our development projects are highly complex and rely on factors that are outside of our control, which may cause us to underestimate the time and capital required to complete a development project.

For example, we experienced mining induced seismic activity in 2017 and 2018 at the Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ) underground mine in the Grasberg minerals district. Results to date of hydraulic fracturing activities to manage rock stresses and pre-condition the DMLZ underground mine for large-scale production have been effective. However, we cannot predict whether additional occurrences of seismic activity or other unexpected geological activity will occur that could cause schedule delays or additional revisions to PT-FI’s mine plans, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.



We must continually replace reserves depleted by production but exploration is highly speculative and our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries.

Our existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations. Because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations, our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our long-term success. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties, requires substantial capital expenditures, and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. We may not be able to discover, enhance, develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels, which could negatively affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.

Estimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.

Our estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves have been calculated in accordance with Industry Guide 7 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral reserves. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on the average prices for the commodities we produce, primarily copper, gold and molybdenum, and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results. Our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. We conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. We revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Geological assumptions about our mineralization that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.

Estimates of proven and probable reserves that will be recovered, or the cost at which we anticipate reserves will be recovered, are based on uncertain assumptions. The uncertain global financial outlook may affect economic assumptions related to reserve recovery and may require reserve revisions. Changes to reserve estimates could affect our asset carrying values and may also negatively impact our future financial condition and results.

In addition, if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline from recent levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease, or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, we can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves can be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our estimated proven and probable reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, the term “mineralized material” does not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Estimates of mineralized material are subject to further exploration and development, and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and/or underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades. Such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs, unit costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the estimated mineralized material not included in reserves will become proven and probable reserves.

Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations, some of which require permits and other approvals. These regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations.

Our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority. As a mining company, compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business. For additional information, see “Environmental risks” below. We are also subject to extensive regulation of worker



health and safety, including the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions. In the U.S., the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Additionally in the U.S. various state agencies have concurrent jurisdiction arising under state law that regulate worker health and safety in both our industrial facilities and mines. If regulatory inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines and penalties and, in instances of alleged significant violations, our mining operations or industrial facilities could be subject to temporary or extended closures. Refer to Exhibit 95.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding certain orders and citations issued by MSHA for our operations during the year ended

December 31, 2019

.

Many other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations, and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. In addition, new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly, but are difficult to predict. Any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business is dependent upon information technology systems, which may be adversely affected by disruptions, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.

Our industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. Our strategy of operating large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets has been increasingly dependent on our ability to become fully integrated and highly automated. Many of our business and operational processes are heavily dependent on traditional and emerging technology systems to conduct day-to-day operations, improve safety and efficiency, and lower costs.

As our dependence on information systems, including those of our third party service providers and vendors, grows, we become more vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency and magnitude. These incidents may include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, phishing, credential attacks, unauthorized access to data and other advanced

and sophisticated cybersecurity breaches and threats, including threats that increasingly target critical operational

technologies and process control networks. If any of these threats materialize, we could be subject to manipulation

or improper use of our systems and networks, production downtimes, communication interruption or other disruptions and delays to our operations or to the transportation of products or infrastructure utilized by our operations, unauthorized release of proprietary, commercially sensitive, confidential or otherwise protected information, the corruption of data, significant health and safety consequences, environmental damage, loss of intellectual property, fines and litigation, damage to our reputation or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. We have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. While these cybersecurity incidents did not result in any material loss to us or interrupt our day-to-day operations, there can be no assurance that we will not experience any such losses in the future.  Given the unpredictability of the timing and the evolving nature and scope of information technology disruptions, the various procedures and controls we use to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our potential risks to such threats may not be sufficient in preventing cybersecurity incidents from materializing. Further, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats.

We could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.

In addition, from time to time, we pursue investments and initiatives to improve the productivity and efficiency of existing systems and operations, including through investments in digital technologies. During 2019, we advanced initiatives in our North America and South America mining operations to enhance productivity, expand margins and reduce the capital intensity of the business through the utilization of new technology applications in combination with a more interactive operating structure. The pilot program initiated at the Bagdad mine in northwest Arizona in late 2018 utilizes data science, machine learning and integrated functional teams to address bottlenecks, provide cost benefits and drive improved overall performance. There can be no certainty that some or any of such



investments and initiatives will meet our capital allocation objectives. In addition, certain of such investments and initiatives are still in the early stages of evaluation, and additional engineering and other analysis is required to fully assess their impact. Further, there can be no certainty as to the time required for us to extract value from these investments or initiatives, or that we will achieve any anticipated savings or efficiency improvements.

Environmental risks

Our operations are subject to complex, evolving and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities.

Our operations, both in the U.S. and internationally, are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances; solid waste disposal; air emissions; wastewater discharges; remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including mine closures and reclamation; well plug and abandonment requirements; protection of endangered and protected species and designation of critical habitats; and other related matters. In addition, we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start, continue and expand operations.

Our Miami, Arizona, smelter processes approximately half of the aggregate copper concentrate produced by our North America copper mines. EPA regulations required us to invest approximately $230 million in 2017 for new pollution control equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO


) to meet both regional haze requirements and to allow the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) to demonstrate compliance with EPA’s SO


ambient air quality standards. During 2019 and January 2020, there were several instances in which the SO


levels exceeded the ambient standard. We are engaged in discussions with ADEQ and conducting an ongoing investigation of the cause of the ambient levels. We cannot guarantee that we will not be required to modify our systems or install additional equipment to address findings, new requirements or for other reasons, which could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.

Laws such as CERCLA and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations, or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing, recycling or disposal. As discussed in more detail in the next risk factor, we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and certain of its affiliates. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities. In addition, compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs, which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight, adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards, as well as other factors.

New or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed, many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business, including those regarding financial assurance in the financial risk factor above. For example, criteria for man-made organic compounds that could be present in soil, groundwater and surface water at our existing and former operations are currently under review by federal and state agencies.

In 2015, EPA and the Department of the Army (collectively, the Agencies) adopted rules that added remote “tributaries” into the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” that are protected by the Clean Water Act, thereby imposing significant additional restrictions on land uses in remote areas with only tenuous connections to active waterways. These rules were challenged by multiple states and industry parties and litigation is ongoing. On October 22, 2019, the Agencies published a final rule that repeals these 2015 rules and recodifies the regulations in place prior to adoption of the 2015 rules.  EPA also published a proposed rule on February 14, 2019, which revises the definition of “waters of the United States” to clarify the scope of waters federally regulated under the Clean Water Act. The final rule will become effective 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register.  This final rule could limit or eliminate our need to obtain federal permits for future expansions at our operations in Arizona and New Mexico. We expect multiple legal challenges to the rule to be filed in federal district courts.

Regulations have been considered at various governmental levels to increase federal financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation and for oil and gas decommissioning. In 2019, legislation was enacted in Colorado that eliminates our ability to use parent company guarantees, and requires proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit issuance authorizing mining operations, with some exceptions for existing operations. Adoption of similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing



regulations may materially increase our costs, threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities.

Our mining operations are subject to regulations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) that are intended to protect species listed by the Department of Interior’s Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) as endangered or threatened, along with critical habitat designated by FWS for these listed species. The regulations limit the ability of landowners, including us, to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations, and may also affect our ability to obtain, retain or deliver water to some operations. On August 27, 2019, FWS published final rules that mitigate, but do not eliminate, potential regulatory constraints on mining operations under the ESA. FWS is also evaluating whether certain species should still be listed under the ESA, and reconsidering critical habitat that was proposed but never finalized.  Environmental groups have aggressively challenged FWS’s regulatory reforms. No assurances can be made that restrictions relating to conservation will not have an adverse impact on expansion of our operations or not result in delays in project development, constraints on exploration and constraints on operations in impacted areas.

We incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners’ shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling

$0.4 billion

in both 2019 and 2018, and

$0.5 billion

in 2017. For


, we expect to incur approximately

$0.5 billion

of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs. The timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters.

We incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years.

FMC and its subsidiaries, and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies, have been involved in exploration, mining, milling, smelting and manufacturing in the U.S. for more than a century. Activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before American industrial companies fully understood the long-term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment.

With the passage of CERCLA in 1980, companies like FMC became legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances, irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who caused it. That liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners, operators and arrangers, meaning that each owner or operator of the property is, and each arranger may be, held fully responsible for the remediation, although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of our acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. We are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources. At

December 31, 2019

, we had more than


active remediation projects in


U.S. states. In addition, FMC and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters, and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us.

At

December 31, 2019

, we had

$1.6 billion

recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to CERCLA or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of operating facilities.



Our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon:

•

Our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases occurred many decades ago;

•

Our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities, which are subject to varying interpretations; and

•

Our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates.

Significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. The actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material.

In addition, remediation standards imposed by EPA and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future. Imposition of more stringent remediation standards, particularly for arsenic and lead in soils, poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies, and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation.

EPA is considering how to reduce lead exposure in the environment under multiple environmental programs. Certain federal and state health agencies also support lower lead cleanup levels. The timing for these EPA activities is unclear, but any reduction in lead cleanup levels could result in material increases to our environmental reserves for ongoing residential property cleanup projects near former smelter sites.

Refer to Note


for further discussion of our environmental obligations.

Our Indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations, could require us to incur increased costs.

Mining operations on the scale of our Indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges. Our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called tailings, that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and silver-bearing materials from the ore that we mine. In 2019, PT-FI produced approximately 39 million metric tons of tailings. Our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the Indonesia government, uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area. Lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands.

Another major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore. In the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals that, if not properly managed, can adversely affect the environment. In addition, certain overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall, with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area; this additional material influences the deposition of finer sediment material in the estuary, as well as presents the potential for increased environmental impacts. The Grasberg overburden stockpiles have experienced significant erosion

,

exacerbated by unanticipated work stoppages that adversely affected our ability to manage certain overburden stockpiles, which may have resulted in adverse environmental impacts. The current tailings deposition management plan as well as environmental monitoring programs take into account the presence of this overburden in the lowlands tailings management area. As part of this effort, PT-FI has expanded the scope of its studies and analysis to assess the environmental impacts from the overburden erosion, including conducting risk assessments to determine whether any such impacts require additional monitoring or mitigation measures, which would result in increased costs.



In the past, certain Indonesia government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition. Because our Indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would be costly, difficult to construct and maintain, and more prone to catastrophic failure, and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. Based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical.

We cannot guarantee that we will not have overtopping or levee failure caused by extreme weather events or unanticipated structural failure in the future, which could result in flooding of the nearby communities. If flooding were to occur, it could result in loss of lives, severe personal, property and environmental damages, which could necessitate evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action, financial assistance to the communities impacted, remediation costs to repair and compensate for the social, cultural and economic impacts.

In December 2018, Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the MOEF) issued a revised environmental permit to PT-FI to address many of the operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies. PT-FI and the MOEF also established a new framework for continuous improvement in environmental practices in PT-FI’s operations, including initiatives that PT-FI will pursue to increase tailings retention and to evaluate large scale beneficial uses of tailings within Indonesia. In addition, PT-FI continues to work with MOEF to finalize environmental permitting related to the rail facilities and certain of the underground mining production operations as well as permitting for the extension of levees to contain the lateral flow of tailings in the lowlands. Refer to Note


for further discussion.

We cannot assure you that future environmental changes affecting the mining industry in Indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly altered or repealed, or that new interpretations of existing environmental laws and regulations will not be issued, which might have a significant impact on PT-FI.

Our copper mining operations require significant energy and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely

affect our operations.

Our copper mining operations require significant energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. Energy represented approximately

20 percent

of our copper mine site operating costs in


, and is expected to approximate

20 percent

in


.

Carbon-based energy is a significant input in our operations, although haul truck diesel use and the amount of purchased power that is derived from fossil fuel or renewable sources varies significantly depending on site production and country-specific circumstances. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances. As a result of the Paris Agreement reached during the 21

st

Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015, a number of governments have pledged “Nationally Determined Contributions” to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., several states, including Colorado and New Mexico, have advanced goals reducing or eliminating fossil-fuel based energy production. The administration of President Trump has announced the intention of the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which begins a lengthy process that will not be completed until November 2020.

Transitions to renewable and other energy sources could, among other things, increase our operating and energy costs depending on the scope and magnitude of increased regulation of fossil-fuel based energy production, including greenhouse gas emissions.

Other risks

Our holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders

’

ability to receive dividends

.

We are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. Cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the U.S.



In addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us or repay loans to us, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements, or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders.

Our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors, including any trade creditors.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. These provisions:

•

Authorize the Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;

•

Establish advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings;

•

Limit who may call stockholder meetings; and

•

Require the approval of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding common stock to enter into certain business combination transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including if the consideration to be received by our common stockholders in the transaction is deemed to be a fair price.

These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the Board.

In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us.

These provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to our stockholders.

Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments.

Not applicable.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

We are involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues. We are also involved periodically in reviews, inquiries, investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition; although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period.

Below is a discussion of our material legal proceedings not otherwise required to be disclosed in Note 12. Refer to Note


for discussion of additional material legal proceedings.



Water Rights Adjudications

Our operations in the western United States (U.S.) require significant secure quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities, and related support facilities. Continuous operation of our mines is dependent on, among other things, our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies. In the arid western U.S., where certain of our mines are located, water rights are often contested, and disputes over water rights are generally time-consuming, expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve both actual and potential claims. The loss of a water right, or a currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations, or force premature closures, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations.

At our North America operations, certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights, which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location. In Arizona, where our operations use both surface and groundwater, we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which Arizona courts have been attempting, for over 40 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the Gila River, one of the state’s largest river systems. This stream adjudication primarily affects our Morenci, Safford and Sierrita mines. The adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users, including us, as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users. Groundwater is treated differently from surface water under Arizona law, which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water, subject only to the requirement of putting it to “reasonable use.” However, court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that some underground water constitutes “subflow” that is to be treated legally as surface water and is therefore subject to the Arizona doctrine of prior appropriation and to the adjudication, and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims. Any re-characterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers, farmers, ranchers, municipalities, and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades. Because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in Arizona, we are an active participant in the adjudication proceeding.

In Re The General Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in the Gila River System and Sources

, Maricopa County, Superior Court, Cause Nos. W-1 (Salt), W-2 (Verde), W-3 (Upper Gila), and W-4 (San Pedro). This case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the Arizona State Land Department and was consolidated and transferred to the Maricopa County Superior Court in 1981. The principal parties, in addition to us, include: the state of Arizona; the Gila Valley Irrigation District; the Franklin Irrigation District; the San Carlos Irrigation and Drainage District; the Salt River Project; the San Carlos Apache Tribe; the Gila River Indian Community; and the U.S. on behalf of those tribes, on its own behalf, and on behalf of the White Mountain Apache Tribe, the Fort McDowell Mohave-Apache Indian Community, the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, and the Payson Community of Yavapai Apache Indians.

Prior to January 1, 1983, various Indian tribes filed suits in the U.S. District Court in Arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other parties, including us, and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights. These federal proceedings have been stayed pending the Arizona Superior Court adjudications and some have been settled.

In 2005, the Maricopa County Superior Court directed the Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR) to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the San Pedro River, a tributary of the Gila River. Underground water within the subflow zone is presumed to constitute appropriable subflow rather than groundwater. Although we have minimal interests in the San Pedro River Basin, a decision that re-characterizes groundwater in that basin as appropriable surface water may set a precedent for other river systems in Arizona that could have material implications for many commercial, industrial, municipal and agricultural users of groundwater, including our Arizona operations. In 2017, the court approved ADWR’s proposed subflow zone delineation. No party has appealed that decision.

In 2014, ADWR submitted a proposal for the development of procedures for “cone of depression” analyses to determine whether a well located outside of the subflow zone creates a cone of depression that intersects the subflow zone. Based on the cone of depression analyses, wells outside of the subflow zone could be subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudication court. In the absence of a valid surface water claim to support the pumping, owners of wells deemed to be depleting the subflow zone through their cones of depression may be subject to claims that they must refrain from pumping or must pay damages. In January 2017, ADWR issued a report containing its



recommended cone of depression test and a trial was held in March 2018 concerning ADWR’s recommended action.

On November 14, 2018, the court’s Special Master issued a final decision rejecting ADWR’s recommended test, instead adopting our position that a numeric model capable of accounting for complexities of the aquifer system should be used. The Special Master also confirmed that this initial cone of depression test is for determining which wells are subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudication court, not proving that a well is pumping subflow or establishing how much of a well’s production is subflow. Those matters will be determined by a subsequent “subflow depletion test,” which has not yet been formulated. Some of our adversaries objected to the Special Master’s final decision, and the adjudication court heard oral argument on the objections in February 2020.

In December 2018, ADWR submitted its initial report on the “subflow depletion test,” which will specify the methodology a well owner must use to quantify the portion of the water drawn from a well that is subflow as opposed to groundwater. ADWR remains in the process of developing its proposed subflow depletion test.  We, along with the other parties, will have the opportunity to provide input during the process and object to the proposal when it is submitted by ADWR.

As part of the Gila River adjudication, the U.S. has asserted numerous claims for express and implied “reserved” surface water and groundwater rights on Indian and non-Indian federal lands throughout Arizona. These claims are related to reservations of federal land for specific purposes (

e.g.

, Indian reservations, national parks, military bases and wilderness areas). Unlike state law-based water rights, federal reserved water rights are given priority in the prior appropriation system based on the date the land was reserved, not the date that water was first used on the land. In addition, federal reserved water rights, if recognized by the court, may enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state law-based water rights.

In multiple instances, the U.S. asserts a right to all water in a particular watershed that was not effectively appropriated under state law prior to the establishment of the federal reservation. This creates risks for both surface water users and groundwater users because such expansive claims may severely impede competing uses of water within the same watershed. Because there are numerous federal reservations in watersheds across Arizona, the reserved water right claims of the U.S. pose a significant risk to multiple operations, including Morenci and Safford in the Upper Gila River watershed, and Sierrita in the Santa Cruz watershed. Because federal reserved water rights may adversely affect water uses at each of these operations, we have been actively involved in litigation over these claims. Because federal reserved water rights have not yet been quantified, the task of determining how much water each federal reservation may use has been left to the Gila River adjudication court. Several “contested cases” to quantify reserved water rights for particular federal reservations in Arizona are currently pending in the adjudication and one was recently resolved. That case,

In re Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness Area

was to resolve the U.S.’s claims to water for the Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness Area. The case was tried in 2015 and the court issued a decision in December 2018 supportive of our position on almost all issues, including rejection of the government’s core argument that wilderness areas are entitled to all water that was not appropriated at the time the reservation was created. We believe the rulings in this case will support our positions in other pending federal reserved right cases, including these:

In re Fort Huachuca

, which involves the U.S.’s claims to water for an Arizona army base and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in February 2017;

In re Redfield Canyon Wilderness Area

, which involves the U.S.’s claims to water for another wilderness area and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in May 2017; and

In re San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area

, which involves the U.S.’s claims to water for a national conservation area and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in May 2018.

Given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications, their long history, and their long-term legal, economic and political implications, it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings. If we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications, our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed, and our operations at Morenci, Safford and Sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources.

OVERVIEW

We are a leading international mining company with headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. We operate large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. We are one of the world’s largest publicly traded copper producers. Our portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits; and significant mining operations in North America and South America, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in Arizona and the Cerro Verde operation in Peru.

We believe that we have a high-quality portfolio of long-lived copper assets positioned to generate long-term value.  PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) continues to advance several projects in the Grasberg minerals district related to the development of its large-scale, long-lived, high-grade underground ore bodies, and we are nearing completion of a project to develop the Lone Star leachable ores near the Safford operation in eastern Arizona. We are also pursuing other opportunities to enhance our mines’ net present values, and we continue to advance studies for future development of our copper resources, the timing of which will be dependent on market conditions.

During 2019, we advanced initiatives in our North America and South America mining operations to enhance productivity, expand margins and reduce the capital intensity of the business through the utilization of new technology applications in combination with a more interactive operating structure. The pilot program initiated at the Bagdad mine in northwest Arizona in late 2018 was successful in utilizing data science, machine learning and integrated functional teams to address bottlenecks, provide cost benefits and drive improved overall performance. The program is being implemented across our North America and South America operations.

During fourth-quarter 2019, PT-FI completed mining the final phase of the Grasberg open pit and continues to achieve important milestones in ramping-up production of large-scale quantities of copper and gold from its significant underground ore bodies. In aggregate, the Grasberg open pit produced over 27 billion pounds of copper and 46 million ounces of gold in the 30-year period from 1990 through 2019. As PT-FI continues to ramp-up production from its underground ore bodies, our consolidated metal production is expected to improve significantly by 2021 (refer to “Operations - Indonesia Mining” for further discussion).

Net (loss) income attributable to common stock totaled

$(239) million

in


and

$2.6 billion

in


. Our results in


, compared to


, primarily reflect lower copper and gold sales volumes resulting from anticipated lower mill rates and ore grades in Indonesia and lower copper prices. Refer to “Consolidated Results” for discussion of items impacting our consolidated results for the two years ended

December 31, 2019

.

At

December 31, 2019

, we had

$2.0 billion

in consolidated cash and cash equivalents,

$9.8 billion

in total debt, and no borrowings and approximately $3.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility.

We have significant mineral reserves, resources and future development opportunities within our portfolio of mining assets. At

December 31, 2019

, our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves totaled

116.0 billion

pounds of copper,

29.6 million

ounces of gold and

3.58 billion

pounds of molybdenum. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates – Mineral Reserves” for further discussion.



During


, production from our mines totaled

3.2 billion

pounds of copper,

0.9 million

ounces of gold and

90 million

pounds of molybdenum. Following is a summary of the geographic locations of our consolidated copper, gold and molybdenum production in


:

a.

Our North America copper mines produced

36 percent

of consolidated molybdenum production, and our Henderson and Climax molybdenum mines produced

32 percent

.

Copper production from the Morenci mine in North America, Cerro Verde mine in Peru and the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia together totaled

72 percent

of our consolidated copper production in


.

OUTLOOK

We continue to view the long-term outlook for our business positively, supported by limitations on supplies of copper and by the requirements for copper in the world’s economy. Our financial results vary as a result of fluctuations in market prices primarily for copper, gold and molybdenum, as well as other factors. World market prices for these commodities have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Refer to “Markets” for further discussion. Because we cannot control the price of our products, the key measures that management focuses on in operating our business are sales volumes, unit net cash costs, operating cash flows and capital expenditures.

Sales Volumes

Following are our projected consolidated sales volumes for


and actual consolidated sales volumes for


:

a.

Includes

30 million

pounds from our Molybdenum mines and

58 million

pounds from our North America and South America copper mines.

Consolidated sales for first-quarter


are expected to approximate

725 million

pounds of copper,

105 thousand

ounces of gold and

22 million

pounds of molybdenum. Projected sales volumes for the year


are dependent on operational performance, weather-related conditions, timing of shipments, the Indonesia government’s extension of PT-FI’s export license beyond March 8, 2020, and other factors. For other important factors that could cause results to differ materially from projections, refer to “Cautionary Statement” and “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.

Consolidated sales for 2021 are currently expected to approximate 4.3 billion pounds of copper, 1.4 million ounces of gold and 90 million pounds of Molybdenum. The increase from 2019 levels primarily reflects PT-FI’s continued ramp-up of production from its significant underground ore bodies and the incorporation of higher mining and milling rates from our productivity and innovation initiatives (which represent an estimated incremental production of approximately 100 million pounds of copper in 2021 and approximately 200 million pounds in 2022).



Consolidated Unit Net Cash Costs

Assuming average prices of

$1,500

per ounce of gold and

$10.00

per pound of molybdenum and achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for our copper mines are expected to average

$1.75

per pound of copper in


. The impact of price changes on


consolidated unit net cash costs would approximate

$0.01

per pound for each

$50

per ounce change in the average price of gold and

$0.03

per pound for each

$2

per pound change in the average price of molybdenum. Quarterly unit net cash costs vary with fluctuations in sales volumes and realized prices, primarily for gold and molybdenum.

Consolidated Operating Cash Flows

Our consolidated operating cash flows vary with sales volumes, prices realized from copper, gold and molybdenum sales, production costs, income taxes, other working capital changes and other factors. Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming average prices of

$2.85

per pound of copper,

$1,500

per ounce of gold and

$10.00

per pound of molybdenum, our consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to approximate

$2.4 billion

(including of

$0.2 billion

in working capital and other sources) for the year


. Estimated consolidated operating cash flows in


also reflect a projected income tax provision of $0.6 billion (refer to “Consolidated Results - Income Taxes” for further discussion of our projected income tax rate for the year


). The impact of price changes during


on operating cash flows would approximate

$350 million

for each

$0.10

per pound change in the average price of copper,

$35 million

for each

$50

per ounce change in the average price of gold and

$125 million

for each

$2

per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.

Consolidated Capital Expenditures

Consolidated capital expenditures are expected to approximate

$2.8 billion

in


, including

$1.8 billion

for major projects primarily associated with underground development activities in the Grasberg minerals district and completion of the Lone Star copper leach project, and exclude estimates associated with the new smelter in Indonesia. A large portion of projected capital expenditures in 2020 relate to projects that are expected to add significant production and cash flow in future periods, enabling us to generate operating cash flows exceeding capital expenditures in future years.

We expect capital expenditures for the development of the new smelter in Indonesia to approximate $0.5 billion in 2020, of which approximately 49 percent will be attributable to our equity interest. PT-FI expects these amounts to be funded by a new bank loan.

MARKETS

World prices for copper, gold and molybdenum can fluctuate significantly. During the period from January 2010 through December 2019, the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper settlement price varied from a low of

$1.96

per pound in 2016 to a record high of

$4.60

per pound in 2011; the London Bullion Market Association (London) PM gold price fluctuated from a low of

$1,049

per ounce in 2015 to a record high of

$1,895

per ounce in 2011, and the

Metals Week

Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price ranged from a low of

$4.46

per pound in 2015 to a high of

$18.60

per pound in 2010. Copper, gold and molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control as described further in our “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.

. During 2019, copper prices continued to be negatively impacted primarily by the trade dispute between the United States (U.S.) and China and a slowing global economy. Beginning in late January 2020, copper prices declined as a result of economic uncertainty in China associated with concerns over the coronavirus. The LME copper settlement price was

$2.53

per pound on

January 31, 2020

.

We believe the underlying long-term fundamentals of the copper business remain positive, supported by the significant role of copper in the global economy and a challenging long-term supply environment attributable to difficulty in replacing existing large mines’ output with new production sources. Future copper prices are expected to be volatile and are likely to be influenced by demand from China and emerging markets, as well as economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of the development of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

MD&A is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S. The preparation of these statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base these estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances; however, reported results could differ from those based on the current estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The areas requiring the use of management’s estimates are also discussed in Note


under the subheading “Use of Estimates.” Management has reviewed the following discussion of its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the Board).

Mineral Reserves

Recoverable proven and probable reserves are the part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The determination of reserves involves numerous uncertainties with respect to the ultimate geology of the ore bodies, including quantities, grades and recovery rates. Estimating the quantity and grade of mineral reserves requires us to determine the size, shape and depth of our ore bodies by analyzing geological data, such as samplings of drill holes, tunnels and other underground workings. In addition to the geology of our mines, assumptions are required to determine the economic feasibility of mining these reserves, including estimates of future commodity prices and demand, the mining methods we use and the related costs incurred to develop and mine our reserves. Our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees. A majority of these estimates are reviewed annually and verified by independent experts in mining, geology and reserve determination.

At

December 31, 2019

, our consolidated estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves were assessed using long-term prices of

$2.50

per pound for copper,

$1,200

per ounce of gold and

$10

per pound of molybdenum. The following table summarizes changes in our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable copper, gold and molybdenum reserves during


and


:

a.

Includes estimated recoverable metals contained in stockpiles. See below for additional discussion of recoverable copper in stockpiles.

b.

Primarily reflects an increase in the copper price assumption from $2.00 per pound to $2.50 per pound for determining reserves in North America and South America.

c.

Primarily reflects an increase in molybdenum reserves at North America copper mines and the Cerro Verde mine in Peru.

Refer to Note 20 and “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, for further information regarding, and risks associated with, our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves.

As discussed in Note


, we depreciate our life-of-mine mining and milling assets and values assigned to proven and probable mineral reserves using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves. Because the economic assumptions used to estimate mineral reserves may change from period to period and additional geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of reserves may change, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations, including changes to prospective depreciation rates and impairments of long-lived asset carrying values. Excluding impacts associated



with changes in the levels of finished goods inventories and based on projected copper sales volumes, if estimated copper reserves at our mines were 10 percent higher at

December 31, 2019

, we estimate that our annual depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense for


would decrease by $37 million ($20 million to net income attributable to common stock), and a 10 percent decrease in copper reserves would increase DD&A expense by $86 million ($45 million to net income attributable to common stock). We perform annual assessments of our existing assets in connection with the review of mine operating and development plans. If it is determined that assigned asset lives do not reflect the expected remaining period of benefit, any change could affect prospective DD&A rates.

As discussed below and in Note


, we review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, and changes to our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves could have an impact on our assessment of asset recoverability.

Recoverable Copper in Stockpiles

We record, as inventory, applicable costs for copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles that are expected to be processed in the future based on proven processing technologies. Mill and leach stockpiles are evaluated periodically to ensure that they are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value (refer to Note


and “Consolidated Results” for further discussion of inventory adjustments recorded for the three years ended

December 31, 2019

). Accounting for recoverable copper from mill and leach stockpiles represents a critical accounting estimate because (i) it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, thus requiring management to employ reasonable estimation methods and (ii) recovery rates from leach stockpiles can vary significantly. Refer to Note


for further discussion of our accounting policy for recoverable copper in stockpiles.

At

December 31, 2019

, estimated consolidated recoverable copper was

1.7 billion

pounds in leach stockpiles (with a carrying value of

$2.2 billion

) and

0.5 billion

pounds in mill stockpiles (with a carrying value of

$0.4 billion

).

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

As discussed in Note


, we assess the carrying values of our long-lived mining assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating our long-lived mining assets for recoverability, we use estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of our individual mines. Estimates of future cash flows are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term metal price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable mineral reserve estimates (refer to Note 1); and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. We believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for our individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows.

For the two years ended December 31,


, we concluded there were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of our long-lived mining assets might not be recoverable.

In addition to decreases in future metal price assumptions, other events that could result in future impairment of our long-lived mining assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine site production levels or costs. Refer to “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.

Environmental Obligations

Our current and historical operating activities are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment, and compliance with those laws requires significant expenditures. Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. The guidance provided by U.S. GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred, and the cost can be reasonably estimated. At

December 31, 2019

, environmental obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet totaled

$1.6 billion

, which reflect obligations for environmental liabilities attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,



Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters. Refer to Notes


and


for further discussion of environmental obligations, including a summary of changes in our estimated environmental obligations for the three years ended

December 31, 2019

.

Accounting for environmental obligations represents a critical accounting estimate because changes to environmental laws and regulations and/or circumstances affecting our operations could result in significant changes to our estimates, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We perform a comprehensive annual review of our environmental obligations and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Judgments and estimates are based upon currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not we are a potentially responsible party (PRP), the ability of other PRPs to pay their allocated portions and take into consideration reasonably possible outcomes. Our cost estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, updated cost assumptions (including increases and decreases to cost estimates), changes in the anticipated scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters, required remediation methods and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We record the fair value of our estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. Fair value is measured as the present value of cash flow estimates after considering inflation and a market risk premium. Our cost estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and comply with our legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. These cost estimates may differ from financial assurance cost estimates for reclamation activities because of a variety of factors, including obtaining updated cost estimates for reclamation activities, the timing of reclamation activities, changes in scope and the exclusion of certain costs not considered reclamation and closure costs. At

December 31, 2019

, AROs recorded in our consolidated balance sheet totaled

$2.5 billion

, including

$0.4 billion

associated with our remaining oil and gas operations. Refer to Notes


and


for further discussion of reclamation and closure costs, including a summary of changes in our AROs for the three years ended

December 31, 2019

.

Generally, ARO activities are specified by regulations or in permits issued by the relevant governing authority, and management judgment is required to estimate the extent and timing of expenditures. Accounting for AROs represents a critical accounting estimate because (i) we will not incur most of these costs for a number of years, requiring us to make estimates over a long period, (ii) reclamation and closure laws and regulations could change in the future and/or circumstances affecting our operations could change, either of which could result in significant changes to our current plans, (iii) the methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores, remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines, and restore the wellsite could change, (iv) calculating the fair value of our AROs requires management to estimate projected cash flows, make long-term assumptions about inflation rates, determine our credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates and determine market risk premiums that are appropriate for our operations and (v) given the magnitude of our estimated reclamation, mine closure and wellsite abandonment and restoration costs, changes in any or all of these estimates could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

Taxes

In preparing our annual consolidated financial statements, we estimate the actual amount of income taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or laws is recognized in income in the period in which such changes are enacted.

Our operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. We and our subsidiaries are subject to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of our contracts or laws. Final taxes paid may be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, we pay a portion of the disputed amount before formally appealing an assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is collectible.



A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred income tax assets for which the weight of available evidence suggests that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income or loss as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred income tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced.

Our valuation allowances totaled

$4.6 billion

at

December 31, 2019

, which covered all of our U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal net operating losses, foreign net operating losses, and substantially all of our U.S. state net operating losses. Refer to Note


for further discussion.

For reconciliations of the per pound unit costs by operating division to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements, refer to “Product Revenues and Production Costs.”



Revenues

Consolidated revenues totaled

$14.4 billion

in


and

$18.6 billion

in


. Our revenues primarily include the sale of copper concentrate, copper cathode, copper rod, gold in concentrate and molybdenum. Following is a summary of changes in our consolidated revenues from 2018 to 2019 (in millions):

Sales Volumes.

Lower copper and gold sales volumes in


, compared to


, primarily reflecting anticipated lower mill rates and ore grades as PT-FI continues to ramp-up production from its underground ore bodies.

Lower molybdenum sales volumes in


, compared with


, primarily reflect lower production from our primary molybdenum mines because of market conditions.

Refer to “Operations” for further discussion of sales volumes at our mining operations.

Realized Prices.

Our consolidated revenues can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold and molybdenum. In 2019, our average realized prices were

6 percent

lower for copper,

13 percent

higher for gold and

1 percent

higher for molybdenum, compared with


.

Average realized copper prices include net unfavorable adjustments to current year provisionally priced copper sales (i.e., provisionally priced sales for the years


and


) totaling

$24 million

for 2019 and

$240 million

for 2018. Refer to Note 14 for a summary of total adjustments to prior period and current period provisionally priced sales. As discussed below and in “Disclosures About Market Risks-Commodity Price Risk”, substantially all of our copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date). We record revenues and invoice customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME prices, which results in an embedded derivative on provisionally priced concentrate and cathode sales that is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end forward prices, until final pricing on the date of settlement. To the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. Accordingly, in times of rising copper prices, our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling copper prices, the opposite occurs.

Prior Year Provisionally Priced Copper Sales.

Net favorable (unfavorable) adjustments to prior years’ provisionally priced copper sales (i.e., provisionally priced copper sales at December 31, 2018 and 2017) recorded in consolidated revenues totaled

$58 million

in


and

$(70) million

in


. Refer to “Disclosures About Market Risks-Commodity Price Risk” for further discussion of our provisionally priced copper sales, and to Note


for a summary of total adjustments to prior period and current period provisionally priced copper sales.



Cobalt Revenues.

Lower cobalt revenues in 2019, compared with 2018, primarily reflect lower cobalt prices.

Purchased Copper.

We purchase copper cathode primarily for processing by our Rod & Refining operations. Purchased copper volumes totaled

379 million

pounds in


and

356 million

pounds in


.

Atlantic Copper Revenues.

Atlantic Copper revenues totaled

$2.1 billion

in


and

$2.3 billion

in


. Lower Atlantic Copper revenues in


, compared with


, primarily reflect lower copper sales volumes and lower copper prices.

Treatment and Refining Charges.

Treatment and refining charges represent payments to smelters and refiners and vary with the volume of metals sold. Lower treatment and refining charges in 2019, compared with 2018, primarily reflect lower sales volumes at PT-FI.

Royalties and Export Duties.

Royalties are primarily for sales from PT-FI and vary with the volume of metal sold and the prices of copper and gold, and PT-FI will continue to pay export duties until development progress for the new smelter in Indonesia exceeds 50 percent. Royalties and export duties totaled $334 million in 2019 compared with $426 million in 2018, primarily reflecting lower sales volumes at PT-FI. The year 2019 also included charges totaling $166 million, primarily associated with an unfavorable Indonesia Supreme Court ruling related to certain disputed PT-FI export duties. Refer to Note


for a summary of PT-FI’s royalties and export duties.

Production and Delivery Costs

Consolidated production and delivery costs totaled

$11.5 billion

in


, compared with

$11.7 billion

in


. Refer to Note


for details of production and delivery costs by operating segment.

Mining Unit Site Production and Delivery Costs

Site production and delivery costs for our copper mining operations primarily include labor, energy and commodity-based inputs, such as sulphuric acid, reagents, liners, tires and explosives. Consolidated unit site production and delivery costs (before net noncash and other costs) for our copper mines averaged

$2.15

per pound of copper in


and

$1.76

per pound in


. Higher consolidated unit site production and delivery costs in


, compared with


, primarily reflected lower volumes associated with PT-FI’s transition from mining the open pit to underground. Refer to “Operations – Unit Net Cash Costs” for further discussion of unit net cash costs associated with our operating divisions, and to “Product Revenues and Production Costs” for reconciliations of per pound costs by operating division to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements.

Our copper mining operations require significant amounts of energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. Energy represented approximately

20 percent

of our copper mine site operating costs in


, including purchases of approximately

230 million

gallons of diesel fuel;

8,200

gigawatt hours of electricity at our North America and South America copper mining operations (we generate all of our power at our Indonesia mining operation);

675 thousand

metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in Indonesia; and

1 million

MMBtu (million British thermal units) of natural gas at certain of our North America mines. Based on current cost estimates, energy will also approximate

20 percent

of our copper mine site operating costs for


.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization

Depreciation will vary under the UOP method as a result of changes in sales volumes and the related UOP rates at our mining operations. Consolidated DD&A totaled

$1.4 billion

in


and

$1.8 billion

in


. Lower DD&A in


, compared with


, primarily reflects lower sales volumes, and lower UOP rates because of increased proven and probable reserves at our North America and South America mines as a result of a higher copper price assumption at December 31, 2018.

Mining Exploration and Research Expenses

Consolidated exploration and research expenses for our mining operations totaled

$104 million

in


and

$105 million

in


. Our mining exploration activities are generally associated with our existing mines, focusing on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity. A drilling program to further delineate the Lone Star resource continues to indicate significant additional mineralization in this district, with higher ore grades than our other North America copper mines. Exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in North America and South America. Exploration spending is expected to approximate

$70 million

in


.



Environmental Obligations and Shutdown Costs

Environmental obligation costs reflect net revisions to our long-term environmental obligations, which vary from period to period because of changes to environmental laws and regulations, the settlement of environmental matters and/or circumstances affecting our operations that could result in significant changes in our estimates (refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates – Environmental Obligations” for further discussion). Shutdown costs include care-and-maintenance costs and any litigation, remediation or related expenditures associated with closed facilities or operations. Net charges for environmental obligations and shutdown costs totaled

$105 million

in


and

$89 million

in


. Higher costs in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily reflect increased legal expenses associated with our legacy talc mining subsidiaries. Refer to Note


for environmental obligations and litigation matters.

Net Gain on Sales of Assets

Net gain on sales of assets totaled

$417 million

in


, primarily including $343 million associated with the sale of our interest in the lower zone of the Timok exploration project in Serbia and $59 million associated with the sale of our cobalt refinery in Kokkola, Finland, and related cobalt cathode precursor business.

Net gain on sales of assets totaled

$208 million

in


, primarily associated with oil and gas transactions and adjustments to assets held for sale.

Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of dispositions.

Interest Expense, Net

Consolidated interest costs (before capitalization and excluding interest expense associated with disputed Cerro Verde royalties and PT-FI's historical contested tax disputes) totaled

$623 million

in


and

$671 million

in


. Lower interest expense in 2019 compared to 2018, reflects a decrease in total debt, primarily reflecting the redemption of our 3.100% Senior Notes due 2020 and a prepayment on the Cerro Verde credit facility. Refer to Note 8 for further discussion of our 2019 debt transactions. Interest expense associated with disputed Cerro Verde royalties totaled

$68 million

(including $58 million associated with installment payment programs) in


and

$370 million

in


. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion.

Capitalized interest varies with the level of expenditures for our development projects and average interest rates on our borrowings, and totaled

$149 million

in


and

$96 million

in


. Refer to “Operations” and “Capital Resources and Liquidity – Investing Activities” for further discussion of current development projects.

Other (Expense) Income, Net

Other (expense) income, net, totaled

$(138) million

in


and

$76 million

in


. The year 2019 includes charges totaling $188 million associated with PT-FI's historical contested tax disputes (refer to Note 11) and a currency exchange adjustment to value-added tax receivables at PT-FI. The year 2018 includes $30 million of interest received on tax refunds, mostly associated with the refund of PT-FI’s prior years’ tax receivables.

In December 2018, we completed our analysis of the Act and recognized benefits totaling $123 million ($119 million net of noncontrolling interest) associated with alternative minimum tax credit refunds.

m.

Refer to Note 12 for a summary of charges related to Cerro Verde’s disputed royalties for prior years.

n.

Our consolidated effective income tax rate is a function of the combined effective tax rates for the jurisdictions in which we operate, excluding the U.S. jurisdiction. Because our U.S. jurisdiction generated net losses during


that will not result in a realized tax benefit, applicable accounting rules require us to adjust our estimated annual effective tax rate to exclude the impact of U.S. net losses.

Assuming achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and average prices of

$2.85

per pound for copper,

$1,500

per ounce for gold and

$10.00

per pound for molybdenum for


, we estimate our consolidated effective tax rate for the year


would approximate

42 percent

. Based on an average price of $2.60 per pound for copper and all other assumptions being the same as discussed above, we estimate our consolidated effective tax rate for 2020 would exceed 90 percent. Changes in sales volumes and average prices during 2020 would incur tax impacts at estimated effective rates of 38 percent for Indonesia, 40 percent for Peru and 0 percent for the U.S.



Changes to the relative proportions of jurisdictional income result in fluctuations to our consolidated effective income tax rate. Because of our U.S. tax position, we do not record a financial statement impact for income or losses generated in the U.S.; therefore, our consolidated effective rate is generally higher than the international rates at lower copper prices and lower than international rates at higher copper prices.

Refer to Note


for further discussion of income taxes.

OPERATIONS

Productivity and Innovation Initiatives

During 2019, we advanced initiatives in our North America and South America mining operations to enhance productivity, expand margins and reduce the capital intensity of the business through the utilization of new technology applications in combination with a more interactive operating structure. The pilot program initiated at the Bagdad mine in northwest Arizona in late 2018 was successful in utilizing data science, machine learning and integrated functional teams to address bottlenecks, provide cost benefits and drive improved overall performance. The program is now being implemented across the North America and South America operations.

A series of action items have been identified, prioritized and are being implemented. Based on the opportunities identified to date, we have incorporated higher mining and milling rates in our future plans, resulting in estimated incremental production of approximately 100 million pounds of copper in 2021 and approximately 200 million pounds in 2022.

Capital expenditures associated with these initiatives are expected to be attractive in relation to developing new copper supply. We currently estimate capital costs of these initiatives, principally for mining equipment and ongoing development of data science and machine learning programs, will approximate $200 million, most of which will be incurred in 2020.

North America Copper Mines

We operate seven open-pit copper mines in North America – Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. All of the North America mining operations are wholly owned, except for Morenci. We record our 72 percent undivided joint venture interest in Morenci using the proportionate consolidation method.

The North America copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and solution extraction/electrowinning (SX/EW) operations. A majority of the copper produced at our North America copper mines is cast into copper rod by our Rod & Refining segment. The remainder of our North America copper production is sold as copper cathode or copper concentrate, a portion of which is shipped to Atlantic Copper (our wholly owned smelter). Molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver are also produced by certain of our North America copper mines

.

Operating and Development Activities.

We have significant undeveloped reserves and resources in North America

and a portfolio of potential long-term development projects. Future investments are dependent on market conditions and will be undertaken based on the results of economic and technical feasibility studies, including the incorporation of innovation initiatives to reduce capital intensity.

Through exploration drilling, we have identified a significant resource at our wholly owned Lone Star copper leach project located near the Safford operation in eastern Arizona. An initial project to develop the Lone Star leachable ores commenced in 2018, with first production expected during 2020. Initial production from the Lone Star leachable ores following a ramp-up period is expected to average approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year, with the potential for future expansion options. Total capital costs for the initial project, including mine equipment and pre-production stripping, are expected to approximate $850 million and will benefit from the utilization of existing infrastructure at the adjacent Safford operation. As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately

$655 million

has been incurred for this project, which is on schedule and within budget. The project also advances exposure to a significant sulfide resource. We expect to incorporate positive drilling and ongoing results in our future development plans.

South America Mining

We operate two copper mines in South America – Cerro Verde in Peru (in which we own a 53.56 percent interest) and El Abra in Chile (in which we own a 51 percent interest), which are consolidated in our financial statements.

South America mining includes open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. Production from our South America mines is sold as copper concentrate or cathode under long-term contracts. Our South America mines also sell a portion of their copper concentrate production to Atlantic Copper. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine produces molybdenum concentrate and silver.

Operating and Development Activities.

Cerro Verde’s expanded operations benefit from its large-scale, long-lived reserves and cost efficiencies and have continued to perform well. Debottlenecking projects and additional initiatives to enhance operating rates continue to be advanced. Cerro Verde concentrating operations averaged

393,100

metric tons of ore per day in 2019. Ongoing productivity and innovation initiatives are targeting the opportunity to increase production to 420,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021.



We continue to evaluate a large-scale expansion at El Abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries. El Abra’s large sulfide resource could potentially support a major mill project similar to facilities constructed at Cerro Verde. Technical and economic studies continue to be advanced to determine the optimal scope and timing of the project in parallel with extending the life of the current leaching operation.

Operating Data.

Following is summary operating data for our South America mining operations for the years ended December 31.

Indonesia Mining

PT-FI’s assets include one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits at the Grasberg minerals district in Papua, Indonesia. PT-FI produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. We have a 48.76 percent interest in PT-FI and manage its mining operations. As further discussed in Note 1, under the terms of the shareholders agreement, our economic interest in PT-FI approximates 81 percent through 2022. PT-FI’s results are consolidated in our financial statements.

Substantially all of PT-FI’s copper concentrate is sold under long-term contracts. During


,

64 percent

of PT-FI’s copper concentrate was sold to PT Smelting (PT-FI’s 25-percent-owned smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia).



PT-FI and union officials have commenced discussions for a new two-year labor agreement. The existing agreement, which expired in September 2019, will continue in effect until a new agreement is consummated.

Operating and Development Activities

. During fourth-quarter 2019, PT-FI completed mining the final phase of the Grasberg open pit and continues to achieve important milestones in ramping-up production of large-scale quantities of copper and gold from its significant underground ore bodies. In the aggregate, the Grasberg open pit produced over 27 billion pounds of copper and 46 million ounces of gold in the 30-year period from 1990 through 2019.

The following provides additional information on the development of the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine, the Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ) underground mine and the new Indonesia smelter. Results to date from the Grasberg Block Cave and DMLZ underground mines are positive and in line with long-term plans to reach full production rates. Estimates of timing of future production from the underground mines continue to be reviewed and may be modified as additional information becomes available.

Grasberg Block Cave

.

PT-FI has commenced extraction of ore from the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine, which is the same ore body historically mined from the surface in the Grasberg open pit. Reserves from the Grasberg Block Cave totaled 17.2 billion pounds of copper and 14.2 million ounces of gold at December 31, 2019, representing approximately half of PT-FI’s total copper and gold reserves. Undercutting, drawbell construction and ore extraction activities in the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine continue to track expectations. Ore extraction from the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine averaged

8,600

metric tons of ore per day in


. Following completion of a maintenance program in mid-December, ore extraction from the Grasberg Block Cave averaged 17,000 metric tons of ore per day. Monitoring data on cave propagation in the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine is providing confidence in growing production rates over time. As existing drawpoints mature and additional drawpoints are added, cave development is expected to increase production rates to an average of 30,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2020, over 60,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021 and 130,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2023 from five production blocks spanning 335,000 square meters.

Mine development capital costs for the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine and associated common infrastructure are expected to approximate $6.7 billion, including $4.6 billion incurred through December 31, 2019 ($0.7 billion during 2019).

DMLZ

.

The DMLZ underground mine, located east of the Grasberg ore body and below the Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine, has continued its ramp-up of production. Hydraulic fracturing operations have been effective in managing rock stresses and pre-conditioning the cave following mining-induced seismic activity experienced in 2017 and 2018. Ore extraction continues to exceed expectations, averaging

9,800

metric tons of ore per day in 2019 and reached approximately 16,000 metric tons of ore per day at year-end 2019. Ongoing hydraulic fracturing operations combined with continued undercutting and drawbell openings in the two currently active production blocks are expected to expand the cave, supporting higher production rates that are expected to average 29,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2020, approach 60,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021 and 80,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2022 from three production blocks.

Mine development capital costs for the DMLZ underground mine are expected to approximate $3.4 billion, including $2.8 billion incurred through December 31, 2019 ($0.3 billion during 2019).

Indonesia Smelter.

In connection with the extension of PT-FI’s mining rights from 2031 to 2041, PT-FI committed to construct a new smelter in Indonesia by December 21, 2023. A site for the new smelter has been selected, and ground preparation is advancing. Engineering and front-end engineering and design for the selected process technology are advancing and expected to be completed in 2020. The preliminary capital cost estimate for the project approximates $3 billion, pending completion of final engineering. Estimated related capital expenditures for 2020 approximate $0.5 billion. PT-FI has advanced financing discussions with a syndicate of banks and expects the project will be funded by a bank loan to PT-FI. The debt service for the new smelter will be shared by PT-FI’s shareholders according to their respective equity ownership percentages. As a result, our future distributions from PT-FI will incorporate approximately 49 percent of the smelter debt service.



Operating Data.

Following is summary operating data for our Indonesia mining operations for the years ended December 31.

Consolidated sales volumes from PT-FI are expected to approximate

750 million

pounds of copper and

0.8 million

ounces of gold in


. As PT-FI continues to ramp-up production from its underground ore bodies, metal production is expected to improve significantly by 2021.

Unit Net Cash Costs.

Unit net cash costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for our respective operations. We use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metal mining companies, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.



Gross Profit per Pound of Copper and per Ounce of Gold

The following tables summarize the unit net cash costs (credits) and gross profit per pound of copper and per ounce of gold at our Indonesia mining operations for the two years ended December 31,


. Refer to “Product Revenues and Production Costs” for an explanation of “by-product” and “co-product” methods and a reconciliation of unit net cash costs (credits) per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements.

a.

Includes charges in revenues totaling $0.25 per pound of copper primarily associated with an unfavorable Indonesia Supreme Court ruling related to certain disputed PT-FI export duties, partly offset by adjustments to prior year treatment charges totaling $0.03 per pound of copper. Also includes charges of

$0.04

per pound of copper associated with adjustments to the settlement of the historical surface water tax disputes with the local regional tax authority in Papua, Indonesia.

b.

Includes net charges of $0.20 per pound of copper (refer to “Consolidated Results” for a summary of these charges).

A significant portion of PT-FI’s costs are fixed and unit costs vary depending volumes and other factors. PT-FI’s unit net cash costs (including gold and silver credits) of

$1.28

per pound of copper in


, were higher than unit net cash credits of

$0.58

per pound in


, primarily reflecting lower copper production and gold credits.

Treatment charges vary with the volume of metals sold and the price of copper, and royalties vary with the volume of metals sold and the prices of copper and gold. PT-FI will continue to pay export duties until development progress for the new smelter in Indonesia exceeds 50 percent.

PT-FI’s export duties totaled

$56 million

in


and

$180 million

in


, and PT-FI’s royalties totaled

$107 million

in


and

$238 million

in


. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of PT-FI’s export duties and royalties.

Because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, PT-FI’s unit depreciation rate may vary with asset additions and the level of copper production and sales. DD&A per pound of copper under they by-product method was $0.61 in 2019, compared with $0.54 in 2018, primarily reflecting lower copper sales volumes in 2019.

Revenue adjustments primarily result from changes in prices on provisionally priced copper sales recognized in prior periods. Refer to “Consolidated Results - Revenues” for further discussion of adjustments to prior period provisionally priced copper sales.

PT Smelting intercompany (loss) profit represents the change in the deferral of 25 percent of PT-FI’s profit on sales to PT Smelting. Refer to “Operations - Smelting & Refining” below for further discussion.



Assuming an average gold price of

$1,500

per ounce for


and achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, unit net cash costs (including gold and silver credits) for PT-FI are expected to approximate

$1.04

per pound of copper for the year


. The impact of price changes during


on PT-FI’s average unit net cash costs would approximate

$0.05

per pound for each

$50

per ounce change in the average price of gold.

PT-FI’s projected sales volumes and unit net cash costs for the year


are dependent on a number of factors, including operational performance, timing of shipments and the Indonesia government’s extension of PT-FI’s export license beyond March 8, 2020.

PT-FI’s estimated annual capital spending on underground mine development projects is expected to average

$0.8 billion

per year for the three-year period 2020 through 2022, net of scheduled contributions from PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminum (Persero) (PT Inalum). In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, aggregate costs (before scheduled contributions from PT Inalum), which are expected to average

$1.0 billion

per year for the three-year period 2020 through 2022, will be reflected as an investing activity in our cash flow statement, and contributions from PT Inalum will be reflected as a financing activity.

Molybdenum Mines

We have two wholly owned molybdenum mines in Colorado – the Henderson underground mine and the Climax open-pit mine. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. The majority of the molybdenum concentrate produced at the Henderson and Climax mines, as well as from our North America and South America copper mines, is processed at our own conversion facilities.

Operating and Development Activities.

Production from the Molybdenum mines totaled

29 million

pounds of molybdenum in


and

35 million

pounds in


. The decrease in 2019, compared with 2018, primarily reflects the impact of market conditions. Refer to “Consolidated Results” for our consolidated molybdenum operating data, which includes sales of molybdenum produced at our Molybdenum mines, and from our North America and South America copper mines, and refer to “Outlook” for projected consolidated molybdenum sales volumes.

Unit Net Cash Costs Per Pound of Molybdenum.

Unit net cash costs per pound of molybdenum is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for our respective operations. We use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Unit net cash costs for our Molybdenum mines of

$10.80

per pound of molybdenum in


were higher than

$8.77

per pound in


, primarily reflecting lower sales volumes. Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, average unit net cash costs for the Molybdenum mines are expected to approximate

$10.50

per pound of molybdenum for the year


. Refer to “Product Revenues and Production Costs” for a reconciliation of unit net cash costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements.

Smelting & Refining

We wholly own and operate a smelter in Arizona (Miami smelter), a refinery in Texas (El Paso refinery) and a smelter and refinery in Spain (Atlantic Copper). Additionally, PT-FI owns 25 percent of a smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia (PT Smelting). Treatment charges for smelting and refining copper concentrate consist of a base rate per pound of copper and per ounce of gold and are generally fixed. Treatment charges represent a cost to our mining operations and income to Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting. Thus, higher treatment charges benefit our smelter operations and adversely affect our mining operations. Our North America copper mines are less significantly affected by changes in treatment charges because these operations are largely integrated with our Miami smelter and El Paso refinery. Through this form of downstream integration, we are assured placement of a significant portion of our concentrate production.

During 2019, we incurred charges totaling $38 million for a maintenance turnaround at the Miami smelter. The next major maintenance turnaround at the Miami smelter is scheduled for 2021.



Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. Following is a summary of Atlantic Copper’s concentrate purchases from unaffiliated third parties and our copper mining operations for the two years ended December 31,


:

PT-FI’s contract with PT Smelting provides for PT-FI to supply 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements (subject to a minimum or maximum treatment charge rate) necessary for PT Smelting to produce 205,000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis. PT-FI may also sell copper concentrate to PT Smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205,000 metric tons of copper annually. PT-FI supplied

90 percent

of PT Smelting’s concentrate requirements in both


and


. PT Smelting processed

64 percent

of PT-FI’s concentrate production in


and

38 percent

of such production in


.

PT Smelting produced 246,100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 241,200 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in


; and 258,800 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 257,600 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in


.

In March 2019, PT Smelting received a one-year extension of its anode slimes export license, which currently expires March 11, 2020.

PT Smelting’s maintenance turnarounds (which range from two weeks to a month to complete) typically are expected to occur approximately every two years, with short-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. PT Smelting completed a 30-day maintenance turnaround during 2018, and the next major turnaround is scheduled to start in November 2020.

We defer recognizing profits on sales from our mining operations to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting until final sales to third parties occur. Changes in these deferrals attributable to variability in intercompany volumes resulted in net (reductions) additions to operating income totaling

$(22) million

(

$(18) million

to net income attributable to common stock) in


and

$69 million

(

$42 million

to net income attributable to common stock) in


. Our net deferred profits on our inventories at Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting to be recognized in future periods’ net income attributable to common stock totaled

$38 million

at

December 31, 2019

. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices will result in variability in our net deferred profits and quarterly earnings.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Our consolidated operating cash flows vary with prices realized from copper, gold and molybdenum sales; our sales volumes; production costs; income taxes; other working capital changes and other factors. We believe that we have a high-quality portfolio of long-lived copper assets positioned to generate long-term value. PT-FI has several projects in the Grasberg minerals district related to the development of its large-scale, long-lived, high-grade underground ore bodies (refer to “Operations - Indonesia Mining” for further discussion of PT-FI’s transition of mining from the open pit to underground) and we are in the process of completing a project to develop the Lone Star leachable ores near the Safford operation in eastern Arizona. We are also pursuing other opportunities to enhance our mines’ net present values, and we continue to advance studies for future development of our copper resources, the timing of which will be dependent on market conditions.

As presented in “Outlook”, our projected capital expenditures for 2020 (excluding estimates associated with the new smelter in Indonesia) are approximately $0.4 billion higher than projected operating cash flows. A large portion of the capital expenditures relate to projects that are expected to add significant production and cash flow in future periods, enabling us to generate operating cash flows exceeding capital expenditures in future years. We have cash on hand and the financial flexibility to fund these expenditures and will continue to be disciplined in deploying capital. Subject to future commodity prices for copper, gold and molybdenum, we expect estimated consolidated operating cash flows in


, plus available cash and availability under our credit facility, to be sufficient to fund our



budgeted capital expenditures, cash dividends, noncontrolling interest distributions and other cash requirements for the year.

We have no significant scheduled debt maturities until fourth-quarter 2021.

Refer to “Outlook” for further discussion of projected operating cash flows for 2020.

Cash

Following is a summary of the U.S. and international components of consolidated cash and cash equivalents available to the parent company, net of noncontrolling interests’ share, taxes and other costs at

December 31, 2019

(in billions):

a.

Rounds to less than $0.1 billion.

Cash held at our international operations is generally used to support our foreign operations’ capital expenditures, operating expenses, debt repayments, working capital, or other cash needs. Management believes that sufficient liquidity is available in the U.S. from cash balances and availability from our revolving credit facility. We have not elected to permanently reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, and we have recorded deferred tax liabilities for foreign earnings that are available to be repatriated to the U.S. From time to time, our foreign subsidiaries distribute earnings to the U.S. through dividends that are subject to applicable withholding taxes and noncontrolling interests’ share.

Debt

At

December 31, 2019

, consolidated debt totaled

$9.8 billion

, with a related weighted-average interest rate of 4.5 percent. We had no borrowings,

$13 million

in letters of credit issued and approximately

$3.5 billion

available under our revolving credit facility at

December 31, 2019

. Refer to “Financing Activities” below and Note 8 for further discussion of debt.

As discussed in Note 8, on August 15, 2019, we completed the sale of $1.2 billion of senior notes and used the net proceeds to fund the make-whole redemption of all of our outstanding 6.875% Senior Notes due 2023, and the concurrent tender offers to purchase a portion of our 4.00% Senior Notes due 2021 and 3.55% Senior Notes due 2022. As a result of the redemption and tender offers, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt totaling

$26 million

in 2019.

Operating Activities

We generated consolidated operating cash flows of

$1.5 billion

in


(including

$0.3 billion

in working capital and other sources) and

$3.9 billion

in


(net of

$0.7 billion

in working capital and other uses).

Lower operating cash flows for


, compared with


, primarily reflected lower copper and gold sales volumes and lower copper prices, partly offset by changes in working capital associated with decreases in inventory and timing of international tax payments.

Investing Activities

$291 million

in


and

$218 million

in


. On December 18, 2019, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share on our common stock, which was paid on February 3, 2020, to shareholders of record as of January 15, 2020. The declaration of dividends is at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.

Cash dividends and other distributions paid to noncontrolling interests totaled

$82 million

in


and

$278 million

in


. These payments will vary based on the operating results and cash requirements of our consolidated subsidiaries.

Contributions from Noncontrolling Interests.

During 2019, we received equity contributions totaling

$165 million

from PT Inalum for their share of capital spending on PT-FI underground mine development projects and costs for the new smelter in Indonesia.



CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

We have contractual and other long-term obligations, including debt maturities based on principal amounts, which we expect to fund with available cash, projected operating cash flows, availability under our revolving credit facility or future financing transactions, if necessary. Following is a summary of these various obligations at

December 31, 2019

(in millions):

a.

Scheduled interest payment obligations were calculated using stated coupon rates for fixed-rate debt and interest rates applicable at

December 31, 2019

, for variable-rate debt.

b.

Represents estimated cash payments, on an undiscounted and unescalated basis, associated with ARO and environmental activities (including $478 million for our oil and gas operations). The timing and the amount of these payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of ARO activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs. Refer to Note


for additional discussion of environmental and ARO matters.

c.

Represents contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services agreements enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, and primarily include the procurement of copper concentrate (

$2.3 billion

), cobalt (

$0.5 billion

), electricity (

$0.4 billion

) and transportation services (

$0.3 billion

). Some of our take-or-pay contracts are settled based on the prevailing market rate for the service or commodity purchased, and in some cases, the amount of the actual obligation may change over time because of market conditions. Obligations for copper concentrate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Atlantic Copper at market-based prices. Obligations for cobalt hydroxide intermediate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Freeport Cobalt at market-based prices. Electricity obligations are primarily for long-term power purchase agreements in North America and contractual minimum demand at the South America mines. Transportation obligations are primarily for South America contracted ocean freight.

d.

This table excludes certain other obligations in our consolidated balance sheets, such as estimated funding for pension, postretirement and other employee benefit obligations as the funding may vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions, commitments and contingencies totaling

$122 million

and unrecognized tax benefits totaling

$255 million

where the timing of settlement is not determinable, and other less significant amounts. This table also excludes purchase orders for inventory and other goods and services, as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.

In addition to our debt maturities and other contractual obligations discussed above, we have other commitments, which we expect to fund with available cash, projected operating cash flows, available credit facilities or future financing transactions, if necessary. These include (i) PT-FI’s commitment to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operations through the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development, which expired on December 31, 2019, but negotiations for an extension are currently underway, (ii) Cerro Verde’s scheduled installment payments for disputed mining royalty assessments and (iii) other commercial commitments, including standby letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees. Refer to Notes


,


and


for further discussion of these commitments.



CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

The cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental and substantial cost of our business. At

December 31, 2019

, we had

$1.6 billion

recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributed to CERCLA or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental obligations that are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances.

We incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners’ shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling

$0.4 billion

in both 2019 and 2018. For


, we expect to incur approximately

$0.5 billion

of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs. The timing and amount of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters.

Refer to Note


and “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, for further information about environmental regulation, including significant environmental matters.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We recognize AROs as liabilities when incurred, with the initial measurement at fair value. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to cost of sales. Mine reclamation costs for disturbances are recorded as an ARO and as a related asset retirement cost (ARC) (included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs) in the period of disturbance. Oil and gas plugging and abandonment costs are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC (included in oil and gas properties) in the period in which the well is drilled or acquired. For non-operating properties without reserves, changes to the ARO are recorded in earnings. Our cost estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and comply with our legal obligation to retire tangible, long-lived assets. At

December 31, 2019

, we had

$2.5 billion

recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for AROs, including

$0.4 billion

related to our oil and gas properties. Spending on AROs totaled

$170 million

in


and

$160 million

in


(including $77 million in


and $83 million in


for our oil and gas operations). For


, we expect to incur approximately

$0.3 billion

in aggregate ARO payments (including $96 million for our oil and gas operations). Refer to Note


for further discussion.

Litigation and Other Contingencies

Refer to Notes


and


, and “Legal Proceedings” contained in Part I, Item 3. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, for further discussion of contingencies associated with legal proceedings and other matters.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS

Commodity Price Risk

Our consolidated revenues from our mining operations include the sale of copper concentrate, copper cathode, copper rod, gold, molybdenum and other metals by our North America and South America mines, the sale of copper concentrate (which also contains significant quantities of gold and silver) by our Indonesia mining operations, the sale of molybdenum in various forms by our molybdenum operations, and the sale of copper cathode, copper anode and gold in anode and slimes by Atlantic Copper. Our financial results will vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper and gold, and to a lesser extent molybdenum and silver. For projected sensitivities of our operating cash flow to changes in commodity prices, refer to “Outlook.” World market prices for these commodities have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Refer to “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, for further discussion of financial risks associated with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we sell.

During


, our mined copper was sold

56 percent

in concentrate,

22 percent

as cathode and

22 percent

as rod from North America operations. Substantially all of our copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based primarily on quoted LME monthly average copper settlement prices. We receive market prices based on prices in the specified



future period, which results in price fluctuations recorded through revenues until the date of settlement. We record revenues and invoice customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME prices, which results in an

embedded derivative on our provisionally priced concentrate and cathode sales that is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end forward prices, until final pricing on the date of settlement. To the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. Accordingly, in times of rising copper prices, our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling copper prices, the opposite occurs.

Following are the favorable (unfavorable) impacts of net adjustments to the prior years’ provisionally priced copper sales for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except per share amounts):

At

December 31, 2019

, we had provisionally priced copper sales at our copper mining operations totaling

269 million

pounds of copper (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average price of

$2.80

per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. We estimate that each

$0.05

change in the price realized from the

December 31, 2019

, provisional price recorded would have an approximate

$9 million

effect on


net income attributable to common stock. The LME copper settlement price closed at

$2.53

per pound on

January 31, 2020

.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

The functional currency for most of our operations is the U.S. dollar. Substantially all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in local currencies, including the Indonesian rupiah, Australian dollar, Peruvian sol, Chilean peso and euro. We recognized foreign currency translation gains on balances denominated in foreign currencies totaling

$24 million

in


and

$14 million

in


, primarily at our Indonesia and South America mines. Generally, our operating results are positively affected when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to those foreign currencies and are adversely affected when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to those foreign currencies.

Following is a summary of estimated annual payments and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our annual operating costs:

a.

Reflects the estimated impact on annual operating costs assuming a 10 percent increase or decrease in the exchange rate reported at

December 31, 2019

.

b.

Based on exchange rates at

December 31, 2019

.



Interest Rate Risk

At

December 31, 2019

, we had total debt maturities based on principal amounts of

$9.9 billion

, of which approximately 10 percent was variable-rate debt with interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate. Refer to “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. The table below presents average interest rates for our scheduled maturities of principal for our outstanding debt (excluding fair value adjustments) and the related fair values at

December 31, 2019

(in millions, except percentages):

PRODUCT REVENUES AND PRODUCTION COSTS

Mining Product Revenues and Unit Net Cash Costs

Unit net cash costs per pound of copper and molybdenum are measures intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for the respective operations. We use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures are presented by other metals mining companies, although our measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

We present gross profit per pound of copper in the following tables using both a “by-product” method and a “co-product” method. We use the by-product method in our presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (i) the majority of our revenues are copper revenues, (ii) we mine ore, which contains copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals, (iii) it is not possible to specifically assign all of our costs to revenues from the copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals we produce, (iv) it is the method used to compare mining operations in certain industry publications and (v) it is the method used by our management and the Board to monitor operations and to compare mining operations in certain industry publications. In the co-product method presentations, shared costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent our metals sales volumes and realized prices change.

We show revenue adjustments for prior period open sales as separate line items. Because these adjustments do not result from current period sales, these amounts have been reflected separately from revenues on current period sales. Noncash and other costs, which are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs, consist of items such as stock-based compensation costs, start-up costs, inventory adjustments, long-lived asset impairments, restructuring and/or unusual charges. As discussed above, gold, molybdenum and other metal revenues at copper mines are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. The following schedules are presentations under both the by-product and co-product methods together with reconciliations to amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements.

for further discussion). Investments in unconsolidated companies owned 20 percent or more are recorded using the equity method. Investments in unconsolidated companies owned less than

20 percent

, and for which FCX does not exercise significant influence, are recorded at (i) fair value for those that have a readily determinable fair value or (ii) cost, less any impairment, for those that do not have a readily determinable fair value. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Dollar amounts in tables are stated in millions, except per share amounts.

Business Segments.

FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. FCX’s reportable segments include the Morenci, Bagdad, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Refer to Note


for further discussion.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of FCX’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include minerals reserve estimation; asset lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization; environmental obligations; asset retirement obligations; estimates of recoverable copper in mill and leach stockpiles; deferred taxes and valuation allowances; reserves for contingencies and litigation; asset acquisitions and impairment, including estimates used to derive future cash flows associated with those assets; pension benefits; and valuation of derivative instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Functional Currency.

The functional currency for the majority of FCX’s foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. For foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency are translated at current exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventories, property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, are translated at historical rates. Gains and losses resulting from translation of such account balances are included in other (expense) income, net, as are gains and losses from foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency gains (losses) totaled

Cash Equivalents.

Highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents.

FCX’s restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are primarily related to PT-FI’s commitment for the development of a new smelter in Indonesia; and guarantees and commitments for certain mine closure and reclamation obligations, and customs duty taxes. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are classified as a current or long-term asset based on the timing and nature of when or how the cash is expected to be used or when the restrictions are expected to lapse. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are comprised of time deposits and money market funds.

Inventories.

Inventories include materials and supplies, mill and leach stockpiles, and product inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value (NRV).



Mill and Leach Stockpiles.

Mill and leach stockpiles are work-in-process inventories for FCX’s mining operations. Mill and leach stockpiles contain ore that has been extracted from an ore body and is available for metal recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores, and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating and smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities (

i.e.,

solution extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW)). The recorded cost of mill and leach stockpiles includes mining and haulage costs incurred to deliver ore to stockpiles, depreciation, depletion, amortization and site overhead costs. Material is removed from the stockpiles at a weighted-average cost per pound.

Because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grade of the material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles.

Expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately.

Expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than


percent

depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as


percent

of the total copper recovery may occur during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years.

Processes and recovery rates for mill and leach stockpiles are monitored regularly, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. Adjustments to recovery rates will typically result in a future impact to the value of the material removed from the stockpiles at a revised weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper.

Product.

Product inventories include raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Raw materials are primarily unprocessed concentrate at Atlantic Copper’s smelting and refining operations. Work-in-process inventories are primarily copper concentrate at various stages of conversion into anode and cathode at Atlantic Copper’s operations. Atlantic Copper’s in-process inventories are valued at the weighted-average cost of the material fed to the smelting and refining process plus in-process conversion costs. Finished goods for mining operations represent salable products (

e.g.

, copper and molybdenum concentrate, copper anode, copper cathode, copper rod, copper wire, molybdenum oxide, and high-purity molybdenum chemicals and other metallurgical products). Finished goods are valued based on the weighted-average cost of source material plus applicable conversion costs relating to associated process facilities. Costs of finished goods and work-in-process (

i.e.

, not raw materials) inventories include labor and benefits, supplies, energy, depreciation, depletion, amortization, site overhead costs and other necessary costs associated with the extraction and processing of ore, such as mining, milling, smelting, leaching, SX/EW, refining, roasting and chemical processing. Corporate general and administrative costs are not included in inventory costs.

Property, Plant, Equipment and Mine Development Costs.

Property, plant, equipment and mine development costs are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs, as well as drilling and other costs incurred for the purpose of converting mineral resources to proven and probable reserves or identifying new mineral resources at development or production stage properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Development costs are capitalized beginning after proven and probable mineral reserves have been established. Development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable reserves, including shafts, adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of overburden.

For underground mines certain costs related to panel development, such as undercutting and drawpoint development, are also capitalized as mine development costs until production reaches sustained design capacity for the mine. After reaching design capacity, the mine transitions to the production phase and panel development costs are allocated to inventory and then included as a component of cost of goods sold.

Additionally, interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use.



Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance (

i.e.

, turnarounds) are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets, infrastructure and other common costs is determined using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves (for primary copper mines) and proven and probable molybdenum reserves (for primary molybdenum mines). Development costs and acquisition costs for proven and probable mineral reserves that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. Depreciation, depletion and amortization using the UOP method is recorded upon extraction of the recoverable copper or molybdenum from the ore body, at which time it is allocated to inventory cost and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives for the related assets of up to


years for buildings and


to


years for machinery and equipment, and mobile equipment.

Included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs is value beyond proven and probable mineral  reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007. The concept of VBPP may be interpreted differently by different mining companies. FCX’s VBPP is attributable to (i) mineralized material, which includes measured and indicated amounts, that FCX believes could be brought into production with the establishment or modification of required permits and should market conditions and technical assessments warrant, (ii) inferred mineral resources and (iii) exploration potential.

Carrying amounts assigned to VBPP are not charged to expense until the VBPP becomes associated with additional proven and probable mineral reserves and the reserves are produced or the VBPP is determined to be impaired. Additions to proven and probable mineral reserves for properties with VBPP will carry with them the value assigned to VBPP at the date acquired, less any impairment amounts. Refer to Note


for further discussion.

Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets.

FCX assesses the carrying values of its long-lived mining assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived mining assets for recoverability, estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of FCX’s individual mines are used. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Once it is determined that an impairment exists, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of FCX’s mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; VBPP estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. FCX believes its estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for FCX’s individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows (

i.e.

, Level 3 measurement).

Deferred Mining Costs.

Stripping costs (

i.e.

, the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred during the production phase of an open-pit mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred. Major development expenditures, including stripping costs to prepare unique and identifiable areas outside the current mining area for future production that are considered to be pre-production mine development, are capitalized and amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves for the ore body benefited. However, where a second or subsequent pit or major expansion is considered to be a continuation of existing mining activities, stripping costs are accounted for as a current production cost and a component of the associated inventory.



Environmental Obligations.

Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. Accruals for such expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental obligations attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs are considered probable when a claim is asserted, or is probable of assertion, and FCX, or any of its subsidiaries, have been associated with the site. Other environmental remediation obligations are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances. FCX’s estimates of these costs are based on an evaluation of various factors, including currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not FCX is a potentially responsible party (PRP) and the ability of other PRPs to pay their allocated portions. With the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC that were initially recorded at estimated fair values (refer to Note


for further discussion), environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the obligation, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental remediation (such as fees to third-party legal firms for work relating to determining the extent and type of remedial actions and the allocation of costs among PRPs) are included as part of the estimated obligation.

Environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases and decreases in these obligations and are calculated in the same manner as they were initially estimated. Unless these adjustments qualify for capitalization, changes in environmental obligations are charged to operating income when they occur.

FCX performs a comprehensive review of its environmental obligations annually and also reviews changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly.

Asset Retirement Obligations.

FCX records the fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to cost of sales. In addition, asset retirement costs (ARCs) are capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset’s respective useful life.

For mining operations, reclamation costs for disturbances are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period of the disturbance and depreciated primarily on a UOP basis. FCX’s AROs for mining operations consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation and closure activities. These activities, which are site specific, generally include costs for earthwork, revegetation, water treatment and demolition.

For oil and gas properties, the fair value of the legal obligation is recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period in which the well is drilled or acquired and is amortized on a UOP basis together with other capitalized costs. Substantially all of FCX’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore the wellsite.

For non-operating properties without reserves, changes to the ARO are recorded in earnings.

At least annually, FCX reviews its ARO estimates for changes in the projected timing of certain reclamation and closure/restoration costs, changes in cost estimates and additional AROs incurred during the period.

Refer to Note


for further discussion.



Revenue Recognition.

FCX recognizes revenue for all of its products upon transfer of control in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those products. Transfer of control is in accordance with the terms of customer contracts, which is generally upon shipment or delivery of the product. While payment terms vary by contract, terms generally include payment to be made within 30 days, but not longer than 60 days. Certain of FCX’s concentrate and cathode sales contracts also provide for provisional pricing, which is accounted for as an embedded derivative (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). For provisionally priced sales, 90 percent to 100 percent of the provisional payment is made upon shipment or within 20 days, and final balances are settled in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average copper settlement prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), a division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, and quoted monthly average London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) gold settlement prices.

FCX’s product revenues are also recorded net of treatment charges, royalties and export duties. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCX’s revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of FCX’s contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to smelters and refiners that are generally fixed. Refer to Note 16 for a summary of revenue by product type.

Gold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average LBMA gold settlement price for a specified month near the month of shipment.

The majority of FCX’s molybdenum sales are priced based on the average published

Metals Week

price, plus conversion premiums for products that undergo additional processing, such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical products, for the month prior to the month of shipment.

Stock-Based Compensation.

Compensation costs for share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value and charged to expense over the requisite service period for awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value for stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on FCX’s stock price on the date of grant. Shares of common stock are issued at the vesting date for stock-settled RSUs. The fair value of performance share units (PSUs) are determined using FCX’s stock price and a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The fair value for liability-classified awards (

i.e.

, cash-settled RSUs) is remeasured each reporting period using FCX’s stock price. FCX has elected to recognize compensation costs for stock option awards that vest over several years on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and for RSUs on the graded-vesting method over the vesting period. Refer to Note


for further discussion.

Earnings Per Share.

FCX calculates its basic net (loss) income per share of common stock under the two-class method and calculates its diluted net (loss) income per share of common stock using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the treasury-stock method. Basic net (loss) income per share of common stock was computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders (after deducting accumulated dividends and undistributed earnings to participating securities) by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net (loss) income per share of common stock was calculated by including the basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of all potential dilutive shares of common stock, unless their effect would be anti-dilutive.

New Accounting Standards.

Following is a discussion of new accounting standards.

Income Taxes.

In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. FCX adopted this ASU effective December 31, 2019, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Financial Instruments.

In June 2016, FASB issued an ASU that requires entities to estimate all expected credit losses for most financial assets held at the reporting date based on an expected loss model, which requires consideration of historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also requires enhanced disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2020, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.



Leases.

In February 2016, FASB issued an ASU that requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2019, and elected the practical expedients allowing it to (i) apply the provisions of the updated lease guidance at the effective date, without adjusting the comparative periods presented and (ii) not reassess lease contracts, lease classification and initial direct costs of leases existing at adoption. FCX also elected an accounting policy to not recognize a lease asset and liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less and a purchase option that is not expected to be exercised. Nearly all of FCX’s leases were considered operating leases under the new ASU. Adoption of this ASU resulted in the recognition of

$


million

in lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019.

Reclassifications.

For comparative purposes, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The reclassifications relate to a change in methodology for determining current leach stockpiles (refer to Note 4) and a revision to FCX’s presentation of business segments to include a new reportable segment (refer to Note 16).

NOTE 2.  ACQUISITIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS

PT-FI Divestment.

On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership.

Pursuant to the previously announced divestment agreement and related documents, PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) (PT Inalum), an Indonesia state-owned enterprise, acquired for cash consideration of

$

3.85

billion

all of Rio Tinto plc's (Rio Tinto) interests associated with its joint venture with PT-FI (the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture) and


percent

of FCX's interests in PT Indonesia Papua Metal Dan Mineral (PTI - formerly known as PT Indocopper Investama), which at the time owned

9.36

percent

of PT-FI. Of the

$

3.85

billion

in cash consideration, Rio Tinto received

$

3.5

billion

and FCX received

$


million

. In addition, Rio Tinto paid FCX

$


million

for its share of the 2018 joint venture cash flows.

In connection with the transaction, an aggregate


percent

share ownership in PT-FI was issued to PT Inalum and PTI (which is expected to be owned by PT Inalum and the provincial/regional government in Papua). Based on a subscription of PT Inalum’s rights to acquire for cash consideration of

$

3.5

billion

all of Rio Tinto’s interests in the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, PT-FI acquired all of the common stock of the entity (PT Rio Tinto Indonesia) that held Rio Tinto’s interest. After the transaction, PT Inalum’s (

26.24

percent

) and PTI’s (

25.00

percent

) collective share ownership of PT-FI totals

51.24

percent

and FCX's share ownership totals

48.76

percent

. The arrangements provide for FCX and the other pre-transaction PT-FI shareholders (

i.e.

, PT Inalum and PTI) to retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture. As a result, FCX’s economic interest in PT-FI is expected to approximate


percent

from 2019 through 2022.

The divestment agreement provides that FCX will indemnify PT Inalum and PTI from any losses (reduced by receipts) arising from any tax disputes of PT-FI disclosed to PT Inalum in a Jakarta, Indonesia tax court letter limited to PTI’s respective percentage share at the time the loss is finally incurred. Any net obligations arising from any tax settlement would be paid on December 21, 2025. As of December 31, 2019, FCX had accrued

$


million

(included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019) related to this indemnification.

FCX, PT-FI, PTI and PT Inalum entered into a shareholders agreement (the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement), which includes provisions related to the governance and management of PT-FI. FCX considered the terms of the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement and related governance structure, including whether PT Inalum has substantive participating rights, and concluded that it has retained control and would continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements following the transaction. Among other terms, the governance arrangements under the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement transfers control over the management of PT-FI’s mining operations to an operating committee, which is controlled by FCX. Additionally, as discussed above, the existing PT-FI shareholders will retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, so that FCX’s economic interest in the project through 2041 will not be significantly affected by the transaction. FCX believes its conclusion to continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements is in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X, Rule 3A-02 (a), which provides for situations in which consolidation of an entity, notwithstanding the lack of majority ownership, is necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the registrant, because of the existence of a parent-subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting stock.



FCX also analyzed PT-FI’s acquisition of the Rio Tinto Joint Venture interests and concluded the transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in mineral reserves and related long-lived mining assets. The acquisition was a single asset because substantially all of the acquired assets are linked to each other and cannot be physically removed without causing a significant diminution to the fair value of the other assets. PT-FI allocated the

$

3.5

billion

purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The fair value estimates were based on, but not limited to, long-term metal price assumptions of

$

3.00

per pound of copper and

$

1,300

per ounce of gold; expected future cash flows based on estimated reserve quantities; costs to produce and develop the related reserves; current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain fixed assets; and appropriate discount rates using an estimated international cost of capital of


percent

. The estimates were primarily based on significant inputs not observable in the market (as discussed above) and thus represent Level 3 measurements.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price:

a.

Deferred income taxes have been recognized on the fair value adjustments to net assets using an Indonesia corporate income tax rate of


percent

.

Under applicable accounting guidance, changes in ownership that do not result in a change in control are accounted for as equity transactions with no impact on net income.

The following table summarizes the consolidated impact of the transaction discussed above on FCX’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 21, 2018:

a.

Primarily reflects the approximate


percent

economic interest in the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture for the period from 2023 through 2041, which was acquired by PTI and PT Inalum.

FCX considered if the adjustment to capital in excess of par value was an indicator of impairment and after considering other factors, such as PT-FI’s historical results and projected undiscounted cash flows, concluded that it did not indicate a potential impairment at PT-FI.

Attribution of PT-FI Net Income or Loss.

FCX has concluded that the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss from December 21, 2018 (the date of the divestment transaction), through December 31, 2022 (the Initial Period), should be based on the economics replacement agreement, as previously discussed. The economics replacement agreement entitles FCX to approximately


percent

of PT-FI dividends paid during the Initial Period, with the remaining


percent

paid to the noncontrolling interests. PT-FI’s net loss for 2019 totaled

$


million

, of which

$


million

was attributed to FCX. PT-FI’s cumulative net loss since December 21, 2018, through December 31, 2019, totaled

$


million

, of which

$


million

was attributed to FCX.



The above-described attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss applies only through the Initial Period. Beginning January 1, 2023, the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss will be based on equity ownership percentages (

48.76

percent

for FCX,

26.24

percent

for PT Inalum and

25.00

percent

for PTI). For all of its other partially owned consolidated subsidiaries, FCX attributes net income or loss based on equity ownership percentages.

Cobalt Business.

In fourth-quarter


, FCX completed the sale of its cobalt refinery in Kokkola, Finland, and related cobalt cathode precursor business (consisting of approximately

$


million

of assets and

$


million

of liabilities at the time of closing) to Umicore

for total cash consideration of approximately

$


million

, including approximately

$


million

of working capital. Under the terms of the agreement, FCX separated its cobalt business, and Umicore acquired the refinery and cathode precursor business. FCX and the current noncontrolling interest partners in Freeport Cobalt will retain the remaining cobalt business, which is a producer of cobalt fine powders, chemicals, catalysts, ceramics and pigments. Lundin Mining Corporation, one of the noncontrolling interest partners, received


percent

of the proceeds from this transaction. FCX recorded a gain of

$


million

in 2019 associated with this transaction.

Timok Transaction.

In 2016, FCX sold an interest in the upper zone of the Timok exploration project in Serbia (the 2016 Transaction).

In December 2019, FCX completed the sale of its interest in the lower zone of the Timok exploration project to an affiliate of the purchaser in the 2016 Transaction, for cash consideration of

$


million

at closing plus the right to future contingent payments of up to

$


million

. These future contingent payments will be based on the future sale of products (as defined in the agreement) from the Timok lower zone. For a period of 12 months after the third anniversary of the initial sale of products from the Timok lower zone, the purchaser can settle, or FCX can demand payment of, such deferred payment obligation, in each case, for a total of

$


million

. As these deferred payments are contingent upon future production (the Timok project is still in the exploration phase) and would result in gain recognition, no amounts were recorded upon the closing of the transaction. Subsequent recognition will be based on the gain contingency model, in which the consideration would be recorded in the period in which all contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized. This is expected to be when FCX (i) is provided periodic product sales information by the purchaser or (ii) gives notice to the purchaser or receives notice from the purchaser regarding the settlement of the deferred payments for

$


million

. In addition, in lieu of such payment upon achievement of defined development milestones, the purchaser agreed to pay the

$


million

contingent consideration provided for in the 2016 Transaction in three installment payments of

$


million

by July 31, 2020,

$


million

by December 31, 2021, and

$


million

by March 31, 2022. As a result of this transaction, FCX recorded a gain of

$


million

, consisting of the cash consideration (

$


million

) and the aggregate discounted amount of the three installment payments (

$


million

).

Oil and Gas Operations.

In 2016, FCX sold the majority of its oil and gas assets held by its wholly owned subsidiary, FCX Oil & Gas LLC (FM O&G). In 2019, FM O&G sold certain property interests for cash consideration of

$


million

(before closing adjustments), which resulted in the recognition of a gain of

$


million

. In 2018, FM O&G disposed of certain property interests that resulted in the recognition of a gain of

$


million

, primarily associated with the abandonment obligations that were assumed by the acquirer. In 2017, FM O&G sold certain property interests for cash consideration of

$


million

(before closing adjustments), which resulted in the recognition of gains of

$


million

.

TF Holdings Limited - Discontinued Operations.

In November 2016, FCX completed the sale of its


percent

interest in TF Holdings Limited (TFHL) to China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. for

$

2.65

billion

in cash (before closing adjustments) and contingent consideration of up to

$


million

in cash, consisting of

$


million

if the average copper price exceeds

$

3.50

per pound and

$


million

if the average cobalt price exceeds

$


per pound, both during the 24-month period ending December 31, 2019.

The contingent consideration was considered a derivative, and the fair value was adjusted through December 31, 2019. FCX realized and collected in January 2020 contingent consideration of

$


million

because the average cobalt price exceeded

$


per pound during the 24-month period ending December 31, 2019 (no amount was realized associated with the copper price), and was included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. The fair value of the contingent consideration derivative was

$


million

at December 31, 2018 (included in other assets). Gains (losses) resulting from changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivative totaling

$


million

in 2019,

$(


) million

in 2018 and

$


million

in 2017 were included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations and primarily resulted from fluctuations in cobalt and copper prices.



In accordance with accounting guidance, FCX reported the results from TFHL as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations because the disposal represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on operations. The consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income were not impacted by discontinued operations as TFHL did not have any other comprehensive income (loss), and the consolidated statements of cash flows are reported on a combined basis without separately presenting discontinued operations.

Net income (loss) from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following:

a.

In accordance with accounting guidance, reflects the recognition of intercompany sales.

b.

Primarily includes gains (losses) associated with the change in the fair value of contingent consideration.

) for unamortized net discounts and unamortized debt issuance costs.

The components of debt follow:

Revolving Credit Facility.

At

December 31, 2019

, FCX had

no

borrowings outstanding and

$


million

in letters of credit issued under its revolving credit facility, resulting in availability of approximately

$

3.5

billion

, of which approximately

$

1.5

billion

could be used for additional letters of credit. For PT-FI,

$


million

of the revolving credit facility is available.



In May 2019, FCX, PT-FI and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC (FM O&G LLC) amended the

$

3.5

billion

,

five

-year, unsecured revolving credit facility to extend

$

3.26

billion

of the facility by one year to April 20, 2024, with the remaining

$


million

maturing on April 20, 2023. In November 2019, the revolving credit facility was amended to allow flexibility during ongoing transition to underground mining at Grasberg. The November 2019 amendment modified (i) the total leverage ratio from

3.75

x to

5.25

x through June 30, 2021 and (ii) the calculation of the total debt component used to determine the total leverage ratio by adjusting the amount of unrestricted cash that may be applied to reduce the amount of total debt from

$

2.5

billion

to

$

1.25

billion

through June 30, 2021.

Interest on loans made under the new revolving credit facility is, at the option of FCX, determined based on the adjusted London Interbank Offered rate (LIBOR) or the alternate base rate (each as defined in the revolving credit facility) plus a spread to be determined by reference to FCX’s credit ratings.

Cerro Verde Credit Facility.

In March 2014, Cerro Verde entered into a

five

-year,

$

1.8

billion

senior unsecured credit facility that is nonrecourse to FCX and the other shareholders of Cerro Verde. In June 2017, Cerro Verde’s credit facility was amended (balance outstanding at the time of amendment was

$

1.275

billion

) to increase the commitment by

$


million

to

$

1.5

billion

, to modify the amortization schedule and to extend the maturity date to June 19, 2022. The amended credit facility amortizes in

four

installments, with

$


million

due on December 31, 2020 (which was fully prepaid during 2018),

$


million

due on June 30, 2021 (which was fully prepaid during 2018),

$


million

due on December 31, 2021 (of which

$


million

was prepaid during 2019 and

$


million

was prepaid during 2018), and the remaining balance due on the maturity date of June 19, 2022. All other terms, including the interest rates, remain the same. Interest under the term loan is based on LIBOR plus a spread based on Cerro Verde’s total net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio as defined in the agreement. The interest rate on Cerro Verde’s credit facility was

3.70

percent

at December 31, 2019.

Cerro Verde Shareholder Loans.

In December 2014, Cerro Verde entered into loan agreements with three of its shareholders for borrowings up to

$


million

.

No

amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and availability under these agreements totals

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

.

Senior Notes issued by FCX.

In August 2019, FCX sold

$


million

of

5.00

%

Senior Notes due 2027 and

$


million

of

5.25

%

Senior Notes due 2029 for total net proceeds of

$

1.187

billion

. Interest on these senior notes is payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. FCX used the net proceeds from this offering to fund the make-whole redemption of all of its outstanding

6.875

%

Senior Notes due 2023, and the concurrent tender offers to purchase a portion of its

4.00

%

Senior Notes due 2021 and its

3.55

%

Senior Notes due 2022, and the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, premiums, fees and expenses in connection with these transactions.

The

4.00

%

Senior Notes due 2021 are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price. The

5.00

%

Senior Notes due 2027 are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price prior to September 1, 2022, and at specified redemption prices thereafter. The

5.25

%

Senior Notes due 2029 are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price prior to September 1, 2024, and at specified redemption prices thereafter.

The senior notes listed below are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price prior to the dates stated below, and beginning on the dates stated below at 100 percent of principal.

These senior notes rank equally with FCX’s other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.



Early Extinguishment of Debt.

During 2019, 2018 and 2017, FCX redeemed in full or purchased a portion of the following senior notes.

In addition, FCX recorded net losses of

$


million

in 2019,

$


million

NOTE 9.

OTHER LIABILITIES, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The components of other liabilities follow:

a.

Refer to Note


for current portion.

b.

Refer to Note


for further discussion.

Pension Plans.

Following is a discussion of FCX’s pension plans.

FMC Plans.

FMC has U.S. trusteed, non-contributory pension plans covering substantially all of its U.S. employees and some employees of its international subsidiaries hired before 2007. The applicable FMC plan design determines the manner in which benefits are calculated for any particular group of employees. Benefits are calculated based on final average monthly compensation and years of service or based on a fixed amount for each year of service. Non-bargained FMC employees hired after December 31, 2006, are not eligible to participate in the FMC U.S. pension plan.

FCX’s funding policy for these plans provides that contributions to pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, for U.S. plans; or, in the case of international plans, the minimum legal requirements that may be applicable in the various countries. Additional contributions also may be made from time to time.

FCX’s policy for determining asset-mix targets for the FMC plan assets held in a master trust (Master Trust) includes the periodic development of asset allocation studies and review of the liabilities to determine expected long-term rates of return and expected risk for various investment portfolios. FCX’s retirement plan administration and investment committee considers these studies in the formal establishment of asset-mix targets defined in the investment policy. FCX’s investment objective emphasizes diversification through both the allocation of the Master Trust assets among various asset classes and the selection of investment managers whose various styles are fundamentally complementary to one another and serve to achieve satisfactory rates of return. Diversification, by asset class and by investment manager, is FCX’s principal means of reducing volatility and exercising prudent investment judgment. FCX’s present target asset allocation approximates


percent

equity investments (primarily global equities),


percent

fixed income (primarily long-term treasury STRIPS or “separate trading or registered interest and principal securities”; long-term U.S. treasury/agency bonds; global fixed income securities; long-term, high-credit quality corporate bonds; high-yield and emerging markets fixed income securities; and fixed income debt securities) and


percent

alternative investments (private real estate, real estate investment trusts and private equity).

The expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration asset allocation, historical and expected future performance on the types of assets held in the Master Trust, and the current economic environment. Based on these factors, FCX expects the pension assets will earn an average of

6.25

percent

per annum beginning January 1, 2020, which was based on the target asset allocation and long-term capital market return expectations.

For estimation purposes, FCX assumes the long-term asset mix for these plans generally will be consistent with the current mix. Changes in the asset mix could impact the amount of recorded pension costs, the funded status of the plans and the need for future cash contributions. A lower-than-expected return on assets also would decrease plan assets and increase the amount of recorded pension costs in future years. When calculating the expected return on plan assets, FCX uses the market value of assets.



Among the assumptions used to estimate the pension benefit obligation is a discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments for service to date. The discount rate assumption for FCX’s U.S. plans is designed to reflect yields on high-quality, fixed-income investments for a given duration. The determination of the discount rate for these plans is based on expected future benefit payments for service to date together with the Mercer Pension Discount Curve - Above Mean Yield. The Mercer Pension Discount Curve - Above Mean Yield is constructed from the bonds in the Mercer Pension Discount Curve that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve. The Mercer Pension Discount Curve consists of spot (

i.e.

, zero coupon) interest rates at one-half-year increments for each of the next


years and is developed based on pricing and yield information for high-quality corporate bonds. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in FCX’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs.

SERP Plan.

FCX has an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its chief executive officer. The SERP provides for retirement benefits payable in the form of a joint and survivor annuity, life annuity or an equivalent lump sum, which is determined on January 1 of the year in which the participant completed


years of credited service. The annuity will equal a percentage of the participant’s highest average compensation for any consecutive three-year period during the five years immediately preceding the completion of


years of credited service. The SERP benefit will be reduced by the value of all benefits from current and former retirement plans (qualified and nonqualified) sponsored by FCX, by FM Services Company, FCX’s wholly owned subsidiary, or by any predecessor employer (including FCX’s former parent company), except for benefits produced by accounts funded exclusively by deductions from the participant’s pay.

PT-FI Plan.

PT-FI has a defined benefit pension plan denominated in Indonesia rupiah covering substantially all of its Indonesia national employees. PT-FI funds the plan and invests the assets in accordance with Indonesia pension guidelines. The pension obligation was valued at an exchange rate of

13,832

rupiah to one U.S. dollar on

December 31, 2019

, and

14,409

rupiah to one U.S. dollar on

December 31, 2018

. Indonesia labor laws require that companies provide a minimum level of benefits to employees upon employment termination based on the reason for termination and the employee’s years of service. PT-FI’s pension benefit obligation includes benefits determined in accordance with this law. PT-FI’s expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration its long-range estimated return for the plan based on the asset mix. Based on these factors, PT-FI expects its pension assets will earn an average of

7.75

percent

per annum beginning January 1, 2020. The discount rate assumption for PT-FI’s plan is based on the Mercer Indonesia zero coupon bond yield curve derived from the Indonesia Government Security Yield Curve. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in PT-FI’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs.

Plan Information.

FCX uses a measurement date of

December 31

for its plans. Information for those plans where the projected benefit obligations and the accumulated benefit obligations exceed the fair value of plan assets follows:



Information on the FCX (FMC and SERP plans) and PT-FI plans as of

for the FCX plans and

$


million

for the PT-FI plan (based on a

December 31, 2019

, exchange rate of

13,832

Indonesia rupiah to one U.S. dollar).

During 2019, the actuarial loss of

$


million

for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the decrease in the discount rate from

4.40

percent

to

3.40

percent

.

During 2018, the actuarial gain of

$


million

for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the increase in the discount rate from

3.70

percent

to

4.40

percent

(

$


million

), partially offset by new census data incorporated into the valuations (

$


million

) and updated demographic assumptions (

$


million

) mainly resulting from mortality updates.

During 2019, the actuarial gain of

$


million

for the PT-FI pension plan primarily resulted from a change in estimated plan administration costs, partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate from

8.25

percent

to

7.25

percent

. During 2018, the actuarial gain of

$


million

for the PT-FI pension plan primarily resulted from the increase in the discount rate from

6.75

percent

to

8.25

percent

and demographic experience gains.



The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and the components of net periodic benefit cost for FCX’s pension plans for the years ended

December 31

follow:

a.

The assumptions shown relate only to the FMC plans.

The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and the components of net periodic benefit cost for PT-FI’s pension plan for the years ended

December 31

follow:

The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is included in operating income, and the other components are included in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Included in accumulated other comprehensive loss are the following amounts that have not been recognized in net periodic pension cost as of December 31:

Plan assets are classified within a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), then to significant observable inputs (Level 2) and the lowest priority to significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).



A summary of the fair value for pension plan assets, including those measured at net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient, associated with the FCX plans follows:

Following is a description of the pension plan asset categories and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value.

Commingled/collective funds are managed by several fund managers and are valued at the NAV per unit of the fund. For most of these funds, the majority of the underlying assets are actively traded securities. These funds (except the real estate property fund) require up to a 15-calendar-day notice for redemptions. The real estate property fund is valued at NAV using information from independent appraisal firms, who have knowledge and expertise about the current market values of real property in the same vicinity as the investments. Redemptions of the real estate property fund are allowed once per quarter, subject to available cash.



Fixed income investments include government and corporate bonds held directly by the Master Trust. Fixed income securities are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. A bid-evaluation price is an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. A mid-evaluation price is the average of the estimated price at which a dealer would sell a security and the estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs.

Common stocks included in global large-cap equity securities and preferred stocks included in other investments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

Private equity investments are valued at NAV using information from general partners and have inherent restrictions on redemptions that may affect the ability to sell the investments at their NAV in the near term.

A summary of the fair value hierarchy for pension plan assets associated with the PT-FI plan follows:

a.

Cash consists primarily of short-term time deposits.

Following is a description of the valuation techniques used for pension plan assets measured at fair value associated with the PT-FI plan. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value.

Government bonds, common stocks and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.



The expected benefit payments for FCX’s and PT-FI’s pension plans follow:

a.

Based on a

December 31, 2019

, exchange rate of

13,832

Indonesia rupiah to one U.S. dollar.

Postretirement and Other Benefits.

FCX also provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain U.S. employees and, in some cases, employees of certain international subsidiaries. These postretirement benefits vary among plans, and many plans require contributions from retirees. The expected cost of providing such postretirement benefits is accrued during the years employees render service.

The benefit obligation (funded status) for the postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans consisted of a current portion of

$


million

(included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of

$


million

(included in other liabilities) at

December 31, 2019

, and a current portion of

$


million

and a long-term portion of

$


million

at

December 31, 2018

. The discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for these plans, which was determined on the same basis as FCX’s pension plans, was

3.00

percent

FCX has a number of postemployment plans covering severance, long-term disability income, continuation of health and life insurance coverage for disabled employees or other welfare benefits. The accumulated postemployment benefit obligation consisted of a current portion of

$


million

(included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of

$


million

(included in other liabilities) at

December 31, 2019

, and a current portion of

$


million

and a long-term portion of

$

FCX also sponsors savings plans for the majority of its U.S. employees. The plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. These savings plans are principally qualified 401(k) plans for all U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees. In these plans, participants exercise control and direct the investment of their contributions and account balances among various investment options. FCX contributes to these plans at varying rates and matches a percentage of employee pre-tax deferral contributions up to certain limits, which vary by plan. For employees whose eligible compensation exceeds certain levels, FCX provides an unfunded defined contribution plan, which had a liability balance of

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

, and

$


million

at

December 31, 2018

, all of which was included in other liabilities.

The costs charged to operations for employee savings plans totaled

Restructuring Charges.

As a result of the first-quarter 2017 regulatory restrictions and uncertainties regarding long-term investment stability, PT-FI took actions to adjust its cost structure, reduce its workforce and slow investments in its underground development projects and new smelter. These actions included workforce reductions through furlough and voluntary retirement programs. Following the furlough and voluntary retirement programs, a significant number of employees and contractors elected to participate in an illegal strike action beginning in May 2017, and were subsequently deemed to have voluntarily resigned under the existing Indonesia laws and regulations. As a result, PT-FI recorded charges in 2017 to production costs of

$


million

, and selling, general and administrative costs of

$


million

for employee severance and related costs, and a pension curtailment loss of

$


million

in production costs.

Stock Award Plans.

FCX currently has awards outstanding under various stock-based compensation plans. The stockholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) provides for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, RSUs, PSUs and other stock-based awards for up to


million

common shares. As of

December 31, 2019

,

46.9

million

shares were available for grant under the 2016 Plan, and no shares were available under other plans.

Stock-Based Compensation Cost.

Compensation cost charged against earnings for stock-based awards for the years ended

follows:

a.  Charges in the U.S. are not expected to generate a future tax benefit.

Stock Options.

Stock options granted under the plans generally expire


years after the date of grant. Stock options granted prior to 2018 generally vest in


percent

annual increments; beginning in 2018, awards granted vest in


percent

annual increments beginning one year from the date of grant. The award agreements provide that participants will receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. Stock options provide for accelerated vesting only upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control.

A summary of stock options outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

, and activity during the year ended

December 31, 2019

, follows:

The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on FCX’s common stock and historical volatility of FCX’s common stock. FCX uses historical data to estimate future option exercises, forfeitures and expected life. When appropriate, separate groups of employees who have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected dividend rate is calculated using the annual dividend (excluding supplemental dividends) at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on Federal Reserve rates in effect for bonds with maturity dates equal to the expected term of the option.



Information related to stock options during the years ended

December 31

follows:

As of

December 31, 2019

, FCX had

$


million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately

1.6

years.

Stock-Settled PSUs and RSUs.

Beginning in 2014, FCX’s executive officers received annual grants of PSUs that vest after

three years

. For the PSUs granted in 2017, the total grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were

0.6

million

, of which the executive officers will earn (i) between


percent

and


percent

of the target shares based on achievement of financial and operating metrics and (ii) +/-


percent

of the target shares based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group. For the PSUs granted in 2018 and 2019, the total grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were

0.5

million

for 2018 and

0.7

million

for 2019, of which the executive officers will earn (i) between


percent

and


percent

of the target shares based on achievement of financial metrics and (ii) +/-


percent

of the target shares based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group.

All of FCX’s executive officers are retirement eligible, and their PSU awards are therefore non-forfeitable. As such, FCX charges the estimated fair value of the PSU awards to expense at the time the financial and operational, if applicable, metrics are established.

FCX grants RSUs that vest over a period of

three years

or at the end of three years to certain employees. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. FCX also grants RSUs to its directors, which vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The fair value of the RSUs is amortized over the vesting period or the period until the director becomes retirement eligible, whichever is shorter. Upon a director’s retirement, all of their unvested RSUs immediately vest. For retirement-eligible directors, the fair value of RSUs is recognized in earnings on the date of grant.

The award agreements provide for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by directors if there is a change of control (as defined in the award agreements) and for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by employees if they experience a qualifying termination within one year following a change of control.

Dividends attributable to RSUs and PSUs accrue and are paid if the award vests.

Cash-Settled RSUs.

Cash-settled RSUs are similar to stock-settled RSUs, but are settled in cash rather than in shares of common stock. These cash-settled RSUs generally vest over

three years

of service. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these cash-settled RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. The cash-settled RSUs are classified as liability awards, and the fair value of these awards is remeasured each reporting period until the vesting dates. The award agreements for cash-settled RSUs provide for accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control.

Dividends attributable to cash-settled RSUs accrue and are paid if the award vests.

The components of deferred taxes follow:

Tax Attributes.

At

December 31, 2019

, FCX had (i) U.S. foreign tax credits of

$

1.7

billion

that will expire between 2020 and 2027, (ii) U.S. federal net operating losses of

$

5.9

billion

that primarily expire between 2036 and 2037, (iii) U.S. state net operating losses of

$

10.8

billion

that primarily expire between 2020 and 2039, (iv) Spanish net operating losses of

$


million

that can be carried forward indefinitely and (v) Indonesia net operating losses of

$

1.2

billion

that expire between 2020 and 2027.

Valuation Allowance.

On the basis of available information at

December 31, 2019

, including positive and negative evidence, FCX has provided valuation allowances for certain of its deferred tax assets where it believes it is more- likely-than-not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances totaled

$

4.6

billion

at

December 31, 2019

, and

$

4.5

billion

at

December 31, 2018

, and covered all of FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal net operating losses, foreign net operating losses and substantially all of its U.S. state net operating losses.

The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits totaled

$

1.7

billion

at

December 31, 2019

. FCX has operations in tax jurisdictions where statutory income taxes and withholding taxes are in excess of the U.S. federal income tax rate. Valuation allowances are recognized on foreign tax credits for which no benefit is expected to be realized.

The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses totaled

$

2.2

billion

and foreign deferred tax assets totaled

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

. Net operating losses and deferred tax assets represent future deductions for which a benefit will only be realized to the extent these deductions offset future income. FCX develops an estimate of which future tax deductions will be realized and recognizes a valuation allowance to the extent these deductions are not expected to be realized in future periods.

Valuation allowances will continue to be carried on U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets, until such time that (i) FCX generates taxable income against which any of the assets, credits or net operating losses can be used, (ii) forecasts of future income provide sufficient positive evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances or (iii) FCX identifies a prudent and feasible means of securing the benefit of the assets, credits or net operating losses that can be implemented.

The

$


million

net increase in the valuation allowances during 2019 primarily related to increases totaling

$


million

in U.S. federal deferred tax assets for which no benefit is expected to be realized, partly offset by a

$


million

decrease in U.S. foreign tax credits associated with expirations and prior year adjustments, and a

$


million

decrease in U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards.



Other Events.

On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with closing the transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former COW. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI is subject to a


percent

corporate income tax rate and a


percent

profits tax on net income beginning in 2019. As a result of the change in statutory tax rate applicable to deferred income tax liabilities, during fourth-quarter 2018, FCX recognized a tax credit of

$


million

.

In 2018, PT-FI received unfavorable Indonesia Tax Court decisions with respect to its appeal of capitalized mine development costs on its 2012 and 2014 corporate income tax returns. PT-FI appealed those decisions to the Indonesia Supreme Court. On October 31, 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court communicated an unfavorable ruling regarding the treatment of mine development costs on PT-FI’s 2014 tax return. During the fourth quarter of 2019, PT-FI met with the Indonesia Tax Office and developed a framework for resolution of the disputed matters. On December 30, 2019, PT-FI made a payment of

$


million

based on its understanding of the framework for resolution of disputes arising from the audits of the tax years 2012 through 2016, as well as tax years 2017 (for which a tax audit is not complete) and 2018 (for which a tax audit has not begun). Additional administrative steps will need to be completed by both PT-FI and the Indonesia Tax Office in order to implement the resolution.

In conjunction with the framework for resolution above, PT-FI recorded total net charges of

$


million

, including

$


million

for non-deductible penalties recorded to other (expense) income,

$


million

for non-deductible interest recorded to interest expense and

$


million

to provision for income tax expense, primarily for the impact of a reduction in the statutory rate on PT-FI’s deferred tax assets.

SUNAT, the Peru national tax authority, has assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator for the period December 2006 to December 2013, which Cerro Verde has contested on the basis that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concessions, irrespective of the method used for processing those minerals. Refer to Note


for further discussion of the Cerro Verde royalty dispute and net charges recorded in 2019, 2018 and 2017.

In December 2016, the Peru parliament passed tax legislation that, in part, modified the applicable tax rates established in its December 2014 tax legislation, which progressively decreased the corporate income tax rate from


percent

in 2014 to


percent

in 2019 and thereafter, and also increased the dividend tax rate on distributions from

4.1

percent

in 2014 to

9.3

percent

in 2019 and thereafter. Under the tax legislation, which was effective January 1, 2017, the corporate income tax rate was

29.5

percent

, and the dividend tax rate on distributions of earnings was


percent

. Cerro Verde’s current mining stability agreement subjects FCX to a stable income tax rate of


percent

through the expiration of the agreement on December 31, 2028. The tax rate on dividend distributions is not stabilized by the agreement.

In September 2014, the Chile legislature approved a tax reform package that implemented a dual tax system, which was amended in January 2016. Under previous rules, FCX’s share of income from Chile operations was subject to an effective


percent

tax rate allocated between income taxes and dividend withholding taxes. Under the amended tax reform package, FCX’s Chile operation is subject to the “Partially-Integrated System,” resulting in FCX’s share of income from El Abra being subject to progressively increasing effective tax rates of


percent

through 2019 and

44.5

percent

in 2020 and thereafter. In November 2017, the progression of increasing tax rates was delayed by the Chile legislature so that the


percent

rate continues through 2021 increasing to

44.5

percent

in 2022 and thereafter. In January 2020, the Chile legislature approved a tax reform package that would further delay the

44.5

percent

rate until 2027 and thereafter. FCX does not expect a material impact from the 2020 legislation.

In 2010, the Chile legislature approved an increase in mining royalty taxes to help fund earthquake reconstruction activities, education and health programs. Mining royalty taxes at FCX’s El Abra mine were


percent

for the years 2013 through 2017. Beginning in 2018, and through 2023, rates moved to a sliding scale of


to


percent

(depending on a defined operational margin).

Uncertain Tax Positions.

FCX accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FCX’s policy associated with uncertain tax positions is to record accrued interest in interest expense and accrued penalties in other (expense) income rather than in the provision for income taxes.



A summary of the activities associated with FCX’s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 follows:

The total amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits included in the consolidated balance sheets was

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

, primarily relating to unrecognized tax benefits associated with royalties and other related mining taxes, and

$


million

at December 31, 2018, and

$


million

at December 31, 2017.

The reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

, included

$


million

(

$


million

net of income tax benefits and valuation allowances) that, if recognized, would reduce FCX’s provision for income taxes. Changes to the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with current year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with FCX

’

s tax treatment of social welfare payments and cost recovery methods. Changes in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with prior year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with royalties and other related mining taxes and cost recovery methods. There continues to be uncertainty related to the timing of settlements with taxing authorities. In January 2020, PT-FI noted an unfavorable ruling related to its 2012 tax return on the Indonesia Supreme Court’s website. Once PT-FI receives the written ruling it will determine the amount of any required accruals, which are not expected to be material. If additional settlements are agreed upon during the year 2020, FCX could experience an additional change in its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits.

FCX or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.

The tax years for FCX’s major tax jurisdictions that remain subject to examination are as follows:

NOTE 12.

CONTINGENCIES

Environmental.

FCX subsidiaries are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants; discharges of water pollutants; generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials; and remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. FCX subsidiaries that operate in the U.S. also are subject to potential liabilities arising under CERCLA and similar state laws that impose responsibility on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the remediation of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment, including damages to natural resources, in some cases irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. Remediation liability also extends to persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or transported the hazardous substances to a disposal site selected by the transporter. These liabilities are often shared on a joint and several basis, meaning that each responsible party is fully responsible for the remediation, if some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies FCX now owns are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and FCX expects to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. Certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture and various state agencies that, under CERCLA



or similar state laws and regulations, they may be liable for costs of responding to environmental conditions at a number of sites that have been or are being investigated to determine whether releases of hazardous substances have occurred and, if so, to develop and implement remedial actions to address environmental concerns. FCX is also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources (NRD) and to litigation by individuals allegedly exposed to hazardous substances. As of

December 31, 2019

, FCX had more than


active remediation projects, including NRD claims, in


U.S. states.

A summary of changes in estimated environmental obligations for the years ended

December 31

follows:

a.

Represents accretion of the fair value of environmental obligations assumed in the 2007 acquisition of FMC, which were determined on a discounted cash flow basis.

b.

Adjustments to environmental obligations that do not provide future economic benefits are charged to operating income. Reductions primarily reflect revisions for changes in the anticipated scope and timing of projects and other noncash adjustments.

Estimated future environmental cash payments (on an undiscounted and unescalated basis) total

$


million

in


,

$


million

in


,

$


million

in


,

$


million

in


,

$


million

in


and

$

2.7

billion

thereafter. The amount and timing of these estimated payments will change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs.

At

December 31, 2019

, FCX’s environmental obligations totaled

$

1.6

billion

, including

$

1.4

billion

recorded on a discounted basis for those obligations assumed in the FMC acquisition at fair value. On an undiscounted and unescalated basis, these obligations totaled

$

3.2

billion

. FCX estimates it is reasonably possible that these obligations could range between

$

2.7

billion

and

$

3.7

billion

on an undiscounted and unescalated basis.

At

December 31, 2019

, the most significant environmental obligations were associated with the Pinal Creek site in Arizona; the Newtown Creek site in New York City; historical smelter sites principally located in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania; and uranium mining sites in the western U.S. The recorded environmental obligations for these sites totaled

$

1.4

billion

at

December 31, 2019

. FCX may also be subject to litigation brought by private parties, regulators and local governmental authorities related to these historical sites. A discussion of these sites follows.

Pinal Creek.

The Pinal Creek site was listed under the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s (ADEQ) Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund program in 1989 for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the Pinal Creek drainage near Miami, Arizona. Since that time, environmental remediation has been performed by members of the Pinal Creek Group, consisting of Freeport-McMoRan Miami Inc. (Miami), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and two other companies. Pursuant to a 2010 settlement agreement, Miami agreed to take full responsibility for future groundwater remediation at the Pinal Creek site, with limited exceptions. Remediation work consisting of groundwater extraction and treatment plus source control capping are expected to continue for many years in the future.

Newtown Creek.

From the 1930s until 1964, Phelps Dodge Refining Corporation (PDRC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, operated a copper smelter, and from the 1930s until 1984 operated a copper refinery, on the banks of Newtown Creek (the creek), which is a 3.5-mile-long waterway that forms part of the boundary between Brooklyn and Queens in New York City. Heavy industrialization along the banks of the creek and discharges from the City of New York’s sewer system over more than a century resulted in significant environmental contamination of the waterway. In 2010, EPA notified PDRC, four other companies and the City of New York that EPA considers them to be PRPs under CERCLA. The notified parties began working with EPA to identify other PRPs. In 2010, EPA designated the creek as a Superfund site, and in 2011, PDRC and five other parties (the Newtown Creek Group,



NCG) entered an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to assess the nature and extent of environmental contamination in the creek and identify potential remedial options. The parties

’

RI/FS work under the AOC and their efforts to identify other PRPs are ongoing. EPA recently identified eight additional parties as PRPs for the creek. The draft RI was submitted to EPA in November 2016, and the draft FS is expected to be submitted to EPA in 2022. EPA is not expected to propose a final creek-wide remedy until after the RI/FS is completed, with remedial design possibly beginning in 2022, and the actual remediation construction starting several years later. In July 2019, NCG entered into an AOC to conduct a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) of the first two miles of the creek to support an evaluation of an interim remedy for that section of the creek (Early Action). The FFS was submitted to EPA in December 2019, and a decision on this Early Action is expected in late 2020. The actual costs of fulfilling this remedial obligation and the allocation of costs among PRPs are uncertain and subject to change based on the results of the Early Action, the RI/FS, the remedy ultimately selected by EPA and related allocation determinations. The overall cost and the portion ultimately allocated to PDRC could be material to FCX. As a result of revised cost estimates, FCX recorded charges of

$


million

during 2017 for the Newtown Creek environmental obligation.

Historical Smelter Sites

. FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors at various times owned or operated copper, zinc and lead smelters or refineries in states including Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. For some of these former processing sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by EPA or state agencies that they may be liable for costs of investigating and, if appropriate, remediating environmental conditions associated with these former processing facilities. At other sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have entered into state voluntary remediation programs to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate on-site and off-site conditions associated with the facilities. The historical processing sites are in various stages of assessment and remediation. At some of these sites, disputes with local residents and elected officials regarding alleged health effects or the effectiveness of remediation efforts have resulted in litigation of various types, and similar litigation at other sites is possible.

From 1920 until 1986, United States Metals Refining Company (USMR), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, owned and operated a copper smelter and refinery in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey. Since the early 1980s, the site has been the subject of environmental investigation and remediation, under the direction and supervision of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). On-site contamination is in the later stages of remediation. In 2012, after receiving a request from NJDEP, USMR also began investigating and remediating off-site properties, which is ongoing. On January 30, 2017, a class action titled

Juan Duarte, Betsy Duarte and N.D., Infant, by Parents and Natural Guardians Juan Duarte and Betsy Duarte, Leroy Nobles and Betty Nobles, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. United States Metals Refining Company, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Amax Realty Development, Inc.

, Docket No. 734-17, was filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey against USMR, FCX, and Amax Realty Development, Inc. The defendants removed this litigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, where it remains pending. In December 2017, the plaintiffs amended their complaint and FCX was dismissed as a defendant and FMC was added as a defendant to the lawsuit. In 2019, the court allowed the plaintiffs to add FCX back into the case as a defendant. The suit alleges that USMR generated and disposed of smelter waste at the site and allegedly released contaminants on-site and off-site through discharges to surface water and air emissions over a period of decades and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for economic losses, including diminished property values, additional soil investigation and remediation and other damages. In January 2020, the parties completed briefing on the plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class, which is expected to take at least several months for the court to decide. FCX continues to vigorously defend this matter.

As a result of off-site soil sampling in public and private areas near the former Carteret smelter, FCX increased its associated environmental obligation for known and potential off-site environmental remediation by recording a

$


million

charge to operating income in 2017. Additional sampling and analysis continued through 2019 and is ongoing and could result in additional adjustments to the related environmental remediation obligation in future periods. In 2019, FCX established a new project for off-site sediment contamination. The extent of contamination and potential remedial actions are uncertain and may take several years to evaluate.

Uranium Mining Sites.

During a period between 1940 and the early 1980s, certain FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors were involved in uranium exploration and mining in the western U.S., primarily on federal and tribal lands in the Four Corners region of the southwest. Similar exploration and mining activities by other companies have also caused environmental impacts warranting remediation. In early 2017, the Department of Justice, EPA, Navajo Nation, and two FCX subsidiaries reached an agreement regarding the financial contribution of the U.S. Government and the FCX subsidiaries and the scope of the environmental investigation and remediation work for




former uranium mining sites on tribal lands. The settlement terms are contained in a Consent Decree executed on May 22, 2017, and approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. Under the Consent Decree, the U.S. contributed

$


million

into a trust fund to cover the government’s initial share of the costs, and FCX’s subsidiaries are proceeding with the environmental investigation and remediation work at the


sites. The program is expected to take more than


years to complete. Based on updated cash flow and timing estimates, FCX reduced its associated obligation by recording a

$


million

credit to operating income in 2017 after receiving court approval of the Consent Decree. In addition to uranium activities on tribal lands, FCX is conducting site surveys of historical uranium mining claims associated with FCX subsidiaries on non-tribal federal lands in the Four Corners region. Under a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), site surveys are being performed on over

10,000

mining claims, ranging from undisturbed claims to claims with mining features. Based on these surveys, BLM has issued no further action determinations for certain undisturbed claims. BLM may request additional assessment or reclamation activities for other claims with mining features.

AROs.

FCX’s ARO estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and are based on FCX’s legal obligation to retire tangible, long-lived assets.

A summary of changes in FCX’s AROs for the years ended

December 31

follows:

ARO costs may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations, changes in engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, changes in mine plans, settlements, inflation or other factors and as reclamation (concurrent with mining operations or post mining) spending occurs. ARO activities and expenditures for mining operations generally are made over an extended period of time commencing near the end of the mine life; however, certain reclamation activities may be accelerated if legally required or if determined to be economically beneficial. The methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore wellsites could change over time.

Financial Assurance.

New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and other states, as well as federal regulations governing mine operations on federal land, require financial assurance to be provided for the estimated costs of mine reclamation and closure, including groundwater quality protection programs. FCX has satisfied financial assurance requirements by using a variety of mechanisms, primarily involving parent company performance guarantees and financial capability demonstrations, but also including trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit and other collateral. The applicable regulations specify financial strength tests that are designed to confirm a company’s or guarantor’s financial capability to fund estimated reclamation and closure costs. The amount of financial assurance FCX subsidiaries are required to provide will vary with changes in laws, regulations, reclamation and closure requirements, and cost estimates. At

December 31, 2019

, FCX’s financial assurance obligations associated with these U.S. mine closure and reclamation/restoration costs totaled

$

1.3

billion

, of which

$


million

was in the form of guarantees issued by FCX and FMC. At

December 31, 2019

, FCX had trust assets totaling

$


million

(included in other assets), which are legally restricted to be used to satisfy its financial assurance obligations for its mining properties in New Mexico. In addition, FCX subsidiaries have financial assurance obligations for its oil and gas properties associated with plugging and abandoning wells and facilities totaling

$


million

. Where oil and gas guarantees associated with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimates of the potential exposure.

New Mexico Environmental and Reclamation Programs.

FCX’s New Mexico operations are regulated under the New Mexico Water Quality Act and regulations adopted by the Water Quality Control Commission. In connection with discharge permits, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) has required each of these operations to submit closure plans for NMED’s approval. The closure plans must include measures to assure meeting applicable groundwater quality standards following the closure of discharging facilities and to abate groundwater or surface water contamination to meet applicable standards. FCX’s New Mexico operations also are subject to regulation



under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act (the Mining Act) and the related rules that are administered by the Mining and Minerals Division of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. Under the Mining Act, mines are required to obtain approval of reclamation plans. A finalized closure plan for Chino that met the requirements of these rules was submitted in 2019 for approval. The agencies accepted the closure and post-closure scopes of work cost estimates, and FCX expects to reach an agreement with the agencies on financial assurance calculations and remaining issues in early 2020. Following agency approval of Chino’s closure plan and costs, updated closure plans for Tyrone and Cobre will also be submitted for approval, which FCX expects will result in increases in closure costs for its New Mexico operations. At

December 31, 2019

, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of

$


million

for its New Mexico operations. Additional accruals may be required based on the state’s periodic review of FCX’s updated closure plans and any resulting permit conditions, and the amount of those accruals could be material.

Arizona Environmental and Reclamation Programs.

FCX’s Arizona properties are subject to regulatory oversight in several areas. ADEQ has adopted regulations for its aquifer protection permit (APP) program that require permits for, among other things, certain facilities, activities and structures used for mining, leaching, concentrating and smelting, and require compliance with aquifer water quality standards at an applicable point of compliance well or location during both operations and closure. The APP program also may require mitigation and discharge reduction or elimination of some discharges.

An application for an APP requires a proposed closure strategy that will meet applicable groundwater protection requirements following cessation of operations and an estimate of the cost to implement the closure strategy. An APP application specifies closure obligations, including post-closure monitoring and maintenance. A more detailed closure plan must be submitted within 90 days after a permitted entity notifies ADEQ of its intent to cease operations. A permit applicant must demonstrate its financial ability to meet the closure costs approved by ADEQ. In 2014, the state enacted legislation requiring closure costs for facilities covered by APPs to be updated no more frequently than every six years and financial assurance mechanisms to be updated no more frequently than every two years. In 2016, ADEQ approved a closure plan update for Sierrita, which resulted in increased closure costs. In 2019, ADEQ approved a closure plan update for Morenci (specific to the tailing dams), which resulted in increased closure costs. Morenci’s APP requires it to also update stockpile reclamation plans by 2022, which will result in  increased closure costs. FCX will continue updating its closure strategy and closure cost estimates at other Arizona sites and intends to submit an updated tailings dam system closure cost for Bagdad by 2024.

Portions of Arizona mining facilities that operated after January 1, 1986, also are subject to the Arizona Mined Land Reclamation Act (AMLRA). AMLRA requires reclamation to achieve stability and safety consistent with post-mining land use objectives specified in a reclamation plan. Reclamation plans must be approved by the State Mine Inspector and must include an estimate of the cost to perform the reclamation measures specified in the plan along with financial assurance. FCX will continue to evaluate options for future reclamation and closure activities at its operating and non-operating sites, which are likely to result in adjustments to FCX’s AROs, and those adjustments could be material. At

December 31, 2019

, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of

$


million

for its Arizona operations.

Colorado Reclamation Programs.

FCX’s Colorado operations are regulated by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act (Reclamation Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder. Under the Reclamation Act, mines are required to obtain approval of plans for reclamation of lands affected by mining operations to be performed during mining or upon cessation of mining operations. During 2016, at the request of the Colorado Division of Reclamation Mining & Safety, the Climax mine submitted a revised cost estimate for its current reclamation plan, which did not materially change the closure plan cost. In 2017, Henderson began considering alternatives for the closure of the tailings facility and, in 2018, began evaluating potential options for long-term water treatment. In December 2019, Henderson submitted an updated closure plan, which resulted in increased closure costs. As of

December 31, 2019

, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of

$


million

for its Colorado operations. In 2019, Colorado enacted legislation that requires proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit authorizations for new mining operations and expansions beyond current permit authorizations. While this requirement does not apply to existing operations, it may lead to changes in long-term water management requirements at Climax and Henderson operations and AROs.



Chile Reclamation and Closure Programs.

In July 2011, the Chile senate passed legislation regulating mine closure, which established new requirements for closure plans. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, in November 2018, FCX’s El Abra operation submitted an updated plan with closure cost estimates based on the existing approved closure plan. Approval is expected in 2020. This update will not result in a material increase to closure costs. At

December 31, 2019

, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of

$


million

for its El Abra operation.

Peru Reclamation and Closure Programs

. Cerro Verde is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Peru Ministry of Energy and Mines. Under the closure regulations, mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods, closure cost estimates, methods of control and verification, closure and post-closure plans, and financial assurance. In compliance with the five-year closure plan and cost update required by the Mine Closure Law, the latest closure plan and cost estimate for the Cerro Verde mine expansion were submitted to the Peru regulatory authorities in 2017 and approved in February 2018. This update did not result in a material increase to closure costs. At

December 31, 2019

, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of

$


million

for its Cerro Verde operation.

Indonesia Reclamation and Closure Programs.

The ultimate amount of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred at PT-FI’s operations will be determined based on applicable laws and regulations and PT-FI’s assessment of appropriate remedial activities in the circumstances, after consultation with governmental authorities, affected local residents and other affected parties and cannot currently be projected with precision. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities, while the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities, which are currently estimated to continue through 2041. At

December 31, 2019

, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of

$


million

for its PT-FI operations. During

fourth-quarter


, PT-FI mined the final phase of the Grasberg open pit. As a result, any adjustments to the estimated costs to reclaim PT-FI’s overburden stockpile will impact earnings.

In December 2009, PT-FI submitted its revised mine closure plan to the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources for review and addressed comments received during the course of this review process. In December 2010, the Indonesia government issued a regulation regarding mine reclamation and closure, which requires a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a state-owned bank in Indonesia. In December 2018, PT-FI, in conjunction with the issuance of the IUPK, submitted a revised mine closure plan to reflect the extension of operations to 2041. At

December 31, 2019

, PT-FI had

$


million

in a restricted time deposit account for mine closure guarantees and

$


million

for reclamation guarantees.

In October 2017, Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the MOEF) notified PT-FI of administrative sanctions related to certain activities the MOEF indicated are not reflected in PT-FI’s environmental permit. The MOEF also notified PT-FI that certain operational activities were inconsistent with factors set forth in its environmental permitting studies and that additional monitoring and improvements need to be undertaken related to air quality, water drainage, treatment and handling of certain wastes, and tailings management. In December 2018, the MOEF issued a revised environmental permit to PT-FI to address many of the operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies. The remaining administrative sanctions are being resolved through adoption of revised practices and, in a few situations, PT-FI has agreed with the MOEF on an appropriate multi-year work plan, including the closure of an overburden stockpile. In addition, PT-FI continues to work with MOEF to finalize environmental permitting related to the rail facilities and certain of the underground mining production operations as well as permitting for the extension of levees to contain the lateral flow of tailings in the lowlands.

In December 2018, PT-FI and the MOEF also established a new framework for continuous improvement in environmental practices in PT-FI’s operations, including initiatives that PT-FI will pursue to increase tailings retention and to evaluate large-scale beneficial uses of tailings within Indonesia. The MOEF issued a new decree that incorporates various initiatives and studies to be completed by PT-FI that would target continuous improvement in a manner that would not impose new technical risks or significant long-term costs to PT-FI’s operations. The new framework enables PT-FI to maintain compliance with site-specific standards and provides for ongoing monitoring by the MOEF. In 2018, PT-FI recorded a

$


million

charge for MOEF assessments of prior period permit fees.



Oil and Gas Properties.

Substantially all of FM O&G’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores, remove equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and restore land in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws. Following several sales transactions, FM O&G’s remaining operating areas primarily include offshore California and the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) as of

December 31, 2019

. FM O&G AROs cover approximately


wells and


platforms and other structures. At

December 31, 2019

, FM O&G had accrued reclamation and closure costs of

$


million

.

Litigation.

FCX is involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business or are associated with environmental issues as discussed in this note under “Environmental.” FCX is also involved periodically in reviews, inquiries, investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on FCX’s financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to FCX’s operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period.

Louisiana Parishes Coastal Erosion Cases.

Certain FCX affiliates were named as defendants, along with numerous co-defendants, in


cases out of a total of


cases filed in Louisiana state courts by six south Louisiana parishes (Cameron, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. John the Baptist and Vermilion), alleging that certain oil and gas exploration and production operations and sulphur mining and production operations in coastal Louisiana contaminated and damaged coastal wetlands and caused significant land loss along the Louisiana coast. The state of Louisiana, through the Attorney General and separately through the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, intervened in the litigation in support of the parishes’ claims. Specifically, the cases alleged the defendants failed to obtain and/or comply with required coastal use permits in violation of the Louisiana State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, and sought unspecified damages for the alleged statutory violations, and restoration of the properties at issue to their original condition. Certain FCX affiliates were named as defendants in two of the five cases that had been set for trial, both originally filed on November 8, 2013:

Parish of Plaquemines v. ConocoPhillips Company et al

, 25th Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; No. 60-982, Div. B and

Parish of Plaquemines v. Hilcorp Energy Company et al

, 25th Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; No. 60-999, Div. B. In September 2019, affiliates of FCX reached an agreement in principle to settle all


cases. The maximum out-of-pocket settlement payment will be

$

23.5

million

with the initial payment of

$


million

to be paid upon execution of the settlement agreement. The initial payment will be held in trust and later deposited into a newly formed Coastal Zone Recovery Fund (the Fund) once the state of Louisiana passes enabling legislation to establish the Fund. The settlement agreement will also require the FCX affiliates to pay into the Fund twenty annual installments of

$

4.25

million

beginning in 2023 provided the state of Louisiana passes the enabling legislation. The first two of those annual installments are conditioned only on the enactment of the enabling legislation within three years of execution of the settlement agreement, but all subsequent installments are also conditioned on the FCX affiliates receiving simultaneous reimbursement on a dollar-for-dollar basis from the proceeds of environmental credit sales generated by the Fund, resulting in the

$

23.5

million

maximum total payment obligation. The settlement agreement will need to be executed by all parties, including authorized representatives of the six south Louisiana parishes originally plaintiffs in the suit and certain other non-plaintiff Louisiana parishes and the state of Louisiana. Upon execution of the settlement agreement, the FCX affiliates will be fully released and dismissed from all


pending cases. The agreement in principle does not include any admission of liability by FCX or its affiliates. FCX recorded a charge in third-quarter 2019 for the initial payment of

$


million

, which will be paid upon execution of the settlement agreement. FCX currently expects the settlement agreement to be executed during the first half of 2020.

Asbestos and Talc Claims

. Since approximately 1990, various FCX affiliates have been named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos or talc allegedly contained in industrial products such as electrical wire and cable, raw materials such as paint and joint compounds, talc-based lubricants used in rubber manufacturing or from asbestos contained in buildings and facilities located at properties owned or operated by affiliates of FCX. Many of these suits involve a large number of codefendants. Based on litigation results to date and facts currently known, FCX believes there is a reasonable possibility that losses may have been incurred related to these matters; however, FCX also believes that the amounts of any such losses, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion.



There has been a significant increase in the number of cases alleging the presence of asbestos contamination in talc-based cosmetic and personal care products and in cases alleging exposure to talc products that are not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos. The primary targets have been the producers of those products, but defendants in many of these cases also include talc miners. Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus Mines), a wholly owned subsidiary of CAMC, are among those targets. Cyprus Mines was engaged in talc mining from 1964 until 1992 when it exited its talc business by conveying it to a third party in two related transactions. Those transactions involved (i) a transfer by Cyprus Mines of the assets of its talc business to a newly formed subsidiary that assumed all pre-sale and post-sale talc liabilities, subject to limited reservations, and (ii) a sale of the stock of that subsidiary to the third party. In 2011, the third party sold that subsidiary to Imerys Talc America (Imerys), an affiliate of Imerys S.A.

Cyprus Mines has contractual indemnification rights, subject to limited reservations, against Imerys, which has historically acknowledged those indemnification obligations, and has taken responsibility for all cases tendered to it. However, on February 13, 2019, Imerys filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which triggered an immediate automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code prohibiting any party from continuing or initiating litigation or asserting new claims against Imerys. As a result, Imerys is no longer defending the talc lawsuits against Cyprus Mines and CAMC. In addition, Imerys has taken the position that it alone owns, and has the sole right to access, the proceeds of the legacy insurance coverage of Cyprus Mines and CAMC for talc liabilities. In late March 2019, Cyprus Mines and CAMC challenged this position and obtained emergency relief from the bankruptcy court to gain access to the insurance until the question of ownership and contractual access can be decided in an adversary proceeding before the bankruptcy court, which is currently scheduled for March 2020.

During first-quarter 2019, in a case pending at the time Imerys filed bankruptcy, a California jury entered a

$


million

verdict against Johnson & Johnson and Cyprus Mines, of which approximately

$


million

was attributed to Cyprus Mines. Taking advantage of the temporary access to the insurance authorized by the bankruptcy court, Cyprus Mines used the insurance to fully resolve the case. Cyprus Mines and the insurers also settled several other cases that were set for trial through the end of 2019 and in the first half 2020, and secured delays or dismissals in other cases. Multiple trials have been scheduled over the first half of 2020, and others may be scheduled prior to the adversary proceeding regarding the legacy insurance.

FCX believes that Cyprus Mines and CAMC each has strong defenses to legal liability and that both should have access to the legacy insurance to cover defense costs, settlement and judgments, at least until the bankruptcy court decides otherwise or the insurance is exhausted. At this time, FCX cannot estimate the range of possible loss associated with these proceedings, but it does not currently believe the amount of any such losses are material to its consolidated financial statements. However, there can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion.

Tax and Other Matters.

FCX’s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. FCX and its subsidiaries are subject to reviews of its income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. The final taxes paid may be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, FCX pays a portion of the disputed amount before formally appealing an assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if FCX believes the amount is collectible.

Cerro Verde Royalty Dispute.

SUNAT has assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator, which commenced operations in late 2006, for the period December 2006 to December 2013. Cerro Verde has contested each of these assessments because it believes that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concession, irrespective of the method used for processing such minerals.

No

assessments can be issued for years after 2013, as Cerro Verde began paying royalties on all of its production in January 2014 under its new


-year stability agreement. Since 2014, Cerro Verde has been paying the disputed assessments for the period from December 2006 through December 2013 under installment payment programs provided under Peru law. Through December 31, 2019, Cerro Verde has paid

$


million

under these installment payment programs.



In October 2017, the Peru Supreme Court issued a ruling in favor of SUNAT that the assessments of royalties for the year 2008 on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator were proper under Peru law. As a result of the unfavorable Peru Supreme Court ruling, Cerro Verde recorded net charges of

$


million

in 2017 (consisting of pre-tax charges of

$


million

and

$


million

of net tax charges, net of

$


million

of noncontrolling interests) primarily for royalty assessments for the period December 2006 through the year 2013, penalties and interest related to assessments for the period December 2006 through the year 2008, and other related items that Cerro Verde would have incurred under the view that its concentrator was not stabilized.

In September 2018, the Peru Tax Tribunal denied Cerro Verde’s request to waive penalties and interest for the period January 2009 through September 2011. In December 2018, Cerro Verde elected not to appeal the Peru Tax Tribunal’s decisions. As a result, Cerro Verde recorded net charges of

$


million

in 2018 (consisting of pre-tax charges of

$


million

, net of

$


million

of tax benefits and

$


million

of noncontrolling interests) primarily for penalties and interest related to assessments for the years 2009 through 2013 and other related items. In November 2019, Cerro Verde filed a notice of intent to initiate international arbitration, which triggered a period for mandatory good faith settlement discussions.

Cerro Verde also recognized a net gain of

$


million

(consisting of pre-tax gains of

$


million

and net tax benefits of

$


million

, net of

$


million

in noncontrolling interests) in 2018 for refunds received for the overpayment of special (voluntary) levies (GEM) for the period October 2012 through the year 2013. Cerro Verde has also submitted a refund request for the remainder of the GEM assessments for the period October 2011 through September 2012 totaling

$


million

, but will not record a receivable for this amount until the request is granted by SUNAT.

During 2019, Cerro Verde recorded net charges of

$


million

(consisting of pre-tax charges of

$


million

, net of

$


million

of tax benefits and

$


million

of noncontrolling interests) associated with disputed royalties for prior years.

A summary of the charges recorded for the years ended December 31 related to the Cerro Verde royalty dispute follows:

a.

Amounts are net of gains from the refund of GEM for the period October 2012 through the year 2013.

b.

Includes

$


million

related to disputed royalty assessments for the period from December 2006 to September 2011 (when royalties were determined based on revenues).

c.

Excludes

$


million

of interest costs associated with the installment payment programs.

d.

Includes tax charges of

$


million

for disputed royalties (

$


million

) and other related mining taxes (

$


million

) for the period October 2011 through the year 2013 when royalties were determined based on operating income, mostly offset by a tax benefit of

$


million

associated with disputed royalties and other related mining taxes for the period December 2006 through December 2013.

As of December 31, 2019, Cerro Verde has recorded all of its exposure associated with its royalty dispute with the Peru tax authorities and will continue to record interest charges until all obligations are settled. Any future recoveries would be recorded when collected.



Other Peru Tax Matters.

Cerro Verde has also received assessments from SUNAT for additional taxes, penalties and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. Cerro Verde has filed or will file objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes.

A summary of these assessments follows:

As of

December 31, 2019

, Cerro Verde had paid

$


million

on these disputed tax assessments. A reserve has been applied against these payments totaling

$


million

, resulting in a net receivable of

$


million

(included in other assets), which Cerro Verde believes is collectible.

Indonesia Tax Matters.

PT-FI has received assessments from the Indonesia tax authorities for additional taxes and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. PT-FI has filed objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes.

Excluding surface water and withholding tax assessments discussed below and the Indonesia government’s previous imposition of a

7.5

percent

export duty that PT-FI paid under protest during the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018 (refer to Note 13), a summary of these assessments follows:

As of

December 31, 2019

, PT-FI had paid

$


million

(included in other assets) on disputed tax assessments, which it believes is collectible.

Surface Water Taxes

. PT-FI received assessments from the local regional tax authority in Papua, Indonesia, for additional taxes and penalties related to surface water taxes for the period from January 2011 through December 2018. As a result, PT-FI offered to pay

one trillion

rupiah to settle these historical surface water tax disputes and charged

$


million

to production and delivery costs in December 2018. In May 2019, PT-FI agreed to a final settlement of

1.394

trillion

rupiah (approximately

$


million

) and recorded an incremental charge of

$


million

. PT-FI paid

708.5

billion

rupiah (

$


million

) in October 2019, and will pay the balance of

685.5

billion

rupiah (

$


million

based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2019, and included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019) in February 2021.

Export Duty Matter

. In April 2017, PT-FI entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesia government (the 2017 MOU) confirming that the former COW would continue to be valid and honored until replaced by a mutually agreed IUPK and investment stability agreement. In the 2017 MOU, PT-FI agreed to continue to pay export duties of


percent

on the value of copper concentrate export sales until completion of the divestment and new IUPK. Subsequently, the Customs Office of the Minister of Finance refused to recognize the


percent

export duty agreed to under the 2017 MOU and imposed a

7.5

percent

export duty under the Ministry of Finance regulations, which PT-FI paid under protest during the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018. PT-FI paid

$


million

for this period, and appealed the disputed amounts to the Indonesia Tax Court. The Indonesia Tax Court subsequently announced rulings in favor of PT-FI related to the individual cases involving

$


million

of the disputed amounts, which were refunded by the Indonesia Customs Office to PT-FI.



The Indonesia Customs Office appealed the Indonesia Tax Court decisions on these cases to the Indonesia Supreme Court. On October 29, 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court posted on its website rulings unfavorable to PT-FI for certain of the appealed cases involving approximately half of the

$


million

that had been refunded to PT-FI.

As a result of the October 2019 ruling, FCX recorded a charge of

$


million

during third-quarter 2019 to fully reserve for this matter. PT-FI continues to believe that a

five

percent

export duty was applicable during this period and is evaluating options to recover these overpayments.

Withholding Tax Assessments

. In January 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court posted on its website an unfavorable decision related to a PT-FI 2005 withholding tax matter. PT-FI had also received an unfavorable Indonesia Supreme Court decision in November 2017 and has other pending cases at the Indonesia Supreme Court related to withholding taxes for employees and other service providers for the year 2005 and the year 2007, which total approximately

$


million

(based on the exchange rate as of

December 31, 2019

, and included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019), including penalties and interest. As a result of the January 2019 ruling, PT-FI concluded a loss on all outstanding withholding tax matters is probable under applicable accounting guidance, and it recorded a charge of

$


million

in 2018.

For information regarding PT-FI mine development cost tax matters, refer to Note


.

Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds.

Letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

, primarily for environmental and asset retirement obligations, the Cerro Verde royalty dispute (refer to discussion above), workers’ compensation insurance programs, tax and customs obligations, and other commercial obligations. In addition, FCX had surety bonds totaling

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

, primarily associated with environmental and asset retirement obligations.

Insurance.

FCX purchases a variety of insurance products to mitigate potential losses, which typically have specified deductible amounts or self-insured retentions and policy limits. FCX generally is self-insured for U.S. workers’ compensation, but purchases excess insurance up to statutory limits. An actuarial analysis is performed twice a year on the various casualty insurance programs covering FCX’s U.S.-based mining operations, including workers’ compensation, to estimate expected losses. At

December 31, 2019

, FCX’s liability for expected losses under these insurance programs totaled

$


million

, which consisted of a current portion of

$


million

(included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of

$


million

(included in other liabilities). In addition, FCX has receivables of

$


million

(a current portion of

$


million

included in other accounts receivable and a long-term portion of

$


million

included in other assets) for expected claims associated with these losses to be filed with insurance carriers.

FCX’s oil and gas operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the production of oil and gas, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and releases of toxic gas, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells, production facilities or other property, or injury to persons. While FCX is not fully insured against all risks related to its oil and gas operations, its insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences. FCX is self-insured for named windstorms in the GOM.



NOTE 13.

COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

Leases.

Effective January 1, 2019, FCX adopted the new ASU for lease accounting (refer to Note 1 for further discussion). FCX leases various types of properties, including offices and equipment under non-cancelable leases. Nearly all of FCX’s leases were considered operating leases under the new ASU.

The components of FCX’s leases presented in the consolidated balance sheet as of

December 31, 2019

, follow:

Operating lease costs for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, primarily included in production and delivery expense in the consolidated statement of operations, are as follows:

Prior to the adoption of the new ASU, lease costs totaled

$


million

in 2018 and

$


million

in 2017 (FCX elected the practical expedient not to adjust these years).

FCX paid

$


million

during


for lease liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet (primarily included in operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows). As of

December 31, 2019

, the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the lease liabilities was

5.5

percent

and the weighted-average remaining lease term was

8.2

years

.

The future minimum payments for leases presented in the consolidated balance sheet at

December 31, 2019

, follow:

Future minimum rentals under non-cancelable leases at December 31, 2018, under the prior lease accounting standard, totaled

$


million

in 2019,

$


million

in 2020,

$


million

in 2021,

$


million

in 2022,

$


million

in 2023 and

$


million

thereafter.

Contractual Obligations.

At

December 31, 2019

, based on applicable prices on that date, FCX has unconditional purchase obligations (including take-or-pay contracts with terms less than one year) of

$

3.6

billion

, primarily comprising the procurement of copper concentrate (

$

2.3

billion

), cobalt (

$


million

), electricity (

$


million

) and transportation services (

$


million

). Some of FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations are settled based on the prevailing market rate for the service or commodity purchased. In some cases, the amount of the actual obligation may change over time because of market conditions. Obligations for copper concentrate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Atlantic Copper at market-based prices. Obligations for cobalt hydroxide intermediate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Freeport Cobalt at market-based prices. Electricity obligations are primarily for



long-term power purchase agreements in North America and contractual minimum demand at the South America mines. Transportation obligations are primarily for South America contracted ocean freight.

FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations by year total

$

1.6

billion

in


,

$

and

$

thereafter. During the three-year period ended

December 31, 2019

, FCX fulfilled its minimum contractual purchase obligations.

Special Mining License (IUPK) - Indonesia.

As discussed in Note 2, on December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former COW, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI has been granted an extension of mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend mining rights through 2041, subject to PT-FI completing the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia within five years of closing the transaction and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government. The IUPK, and related documentation, contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041. In addition, FCX, as a foreign investor, has rights to resolve investment disputes with the Indonesia government through international arbitration.

The key fiscal terms set forth in the IUPK include a


percent

corporate income tax rate, a


percent

profits tax on net income, and royalty rates of


percent

for copper,

3.75

percent

for gold and

3.25

percent

for silver. PT-FI’s royalties totaled

$


million

in 2019,

$


million

in 2018 and

$


million

in 2017.

The IUPK requires PT-FI to pay export duties of


percent

, declining to

2.5

percent

when smelter development progress exceeds


percent

and eliminated when smelter progress exceeds


percent

. PT-FI had previously agreed to and has been paying export duties since July 2014 (refer to Note 12 for further discussion of disputed export duties for the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018). PT-FI’s export duties charged against revenues totaled

$


million

in 2019 (excluding

$


million

associated with the historical export duty matter as discussed in Note 12),

$


million

in 2018 and

$


million

in 2017.

The IUPK also requires PT-FI to pay surface water taxes of

$


million

annually, beginning in 2019, which are recognized in production and delivery costs as incurred.

In connection with a memorandum of understanding previously entered into with the Indonesia government in July 2014, PT-FI provided an assurance bond at that time to support its commitment to construct a new smelter in Indonesia (

$


million

based on exchange rate as of December 31, 2019).

On September 12, 2019, PT-FI received approval from the Indonesia government to increase its export quota from approximately

180,000

dry metric tons (DMT) of concentrate to approximately

680,000

DMT for the current export period, which expires March 8, 2020.

Community Development Programs.

FCX has adopted policies that govern its working relationships with the communities where it operates. These policies are designed to guide its practices and programs in a manner that respects and promotes basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by FCX’s operations. FCX continues to make significant expenditures on community development, education, training and cultural programs.

In 1996, PT-FI established the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development (Partnership Fund) through which PT-FI has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health, education, economic development and local infrastructure of the area. PT-FI had committed through December 31, 2019, to provide

one

percent

of its annual revenue for the development of the local communities in its area of operations through the Partnership Fund. Negotiations to extend this agreement are currently underway though PT-FI will continue its contributions to ensure there are no interruptions in the implementation of approved projects. PT-FI charged

$


million

in


,

$


million

in


and

$


million

in


to cost of sales for this commitment.

Guarantees.

FCX provides certain financial guarantees (including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others) and indemnities.



Prior to its acquisition by FCX, FMC and its subsidiaries have, as part of merger, acquisition, divestiture and other transactions, from time to time, indemnified certain sellers, buyers or other parties related to the transaction from and against certain liabilities associated with conditions in existence (or claims associated with actions taken) prior to the closing date of the transaction. As part of these transactions, FMC indemnified the counterparty from and against certain excluded or retained liabilities existing at the time of sale that would otherwise have been transferred to the party at closing. These indemnity provisions generally now require FCX to indemnify the party against certain liabilities that may arise in the future from the pre-closing activities of FMC for assets sold or purchased. The indemnity classifications include environmental, tax and certain operating liabilities, claims or litigation existing at closing and various excluded liabilities or obligations. Most of these indemnity obligations arise from transactions that closed many years ago, and given the nature of these indemnity obligations, it is not possible to estimate the maximum potential exposure. Except as described in the following sentence, FCX does not consider any of such obligations as having a probable likelihood of payment that is reasonably estimable, and accordingly, has not recorded any obligations associated with these indemnities. With respect to FCX’s environmental indemnity obligations, any expected costs from these guarantees are accrued when potential environmental obligations are considered by management to be probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.

NOTE 14.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FCX does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments unless there is an existing asset or obligation, or it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur and will result in exposure to market risks, which FCX intends to offset or mitigate. FCX does not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, but has entered into derivative financial instruments in limited instances to achieve specific objectives. These objectives principally relate to managing risks associated with commodity price changes, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

Commodity Contracts.

From time to time, FCX has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the market risk associated with fluctuations in the prices of commodities it purchases and sells. Derivative financial instruments used by FCX to manage its risks do not contain credit risk-related contingent provisions. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, FCX had no price protection contracts relating to its mine production. A discussion of FCX’s derivative contracts and programs follows.

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments – Fair Value Hedges

Copper Futures and Swap Contracts.

Some of FCX’s U.S. copper rod customers request a fixed market price instead of the COMEX average copper price in the month of shipment. FCX hedges this price exposure in a manner that allows it to receive the COMEX average price in the month of shipment while the customers pay the fixed price they requested. FCX accomplishes this by entering into copper futures or swap contracts. Hedging gains or losses from these copper futures and swap contracts are recorded in revenues. FCX did not have any significant gains or losses during the three years ended

December 31, 2019

, resulting from hedge ineffectiveness. At

December 31, 2019

, FCX held copper futures and swap contracts that qualified for hedge accounting for


million

pounds at an average contract price of

$

2.69

per pound, with maturities through

August 2021

.

A summary of gains (losses) recognized in revenues for derivative financial instruments related to commodity contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedge transactions, including the unrealized (losses) gains on the related hedged item for the years ended

December 31

follows:



Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

Embedded Derivatives.

Certain FCX concentrate, copper cathode and gold sales contracts provide for provisional pricing primarily based on the LME copper price or the COMEX copper price and the LBMA gold price at the time of shipment as specified in the contract. FCX receives market prices based on prices in the specified future month, which results in price fluctuations recorded in revenues until the date of settlement. FCX records revenues and invoices customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME or COMEX copper prices and LBMA gold prices as specified in the contracts, which results in an embedded derivative (

i.e.

, a pricing mechanism that is finalized after the time of delivery) that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale of the metals contained in the concentrate or cathode at the then-current LME or COMEX copper price and the LBMA gold price. FCX applies the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception in accordance with derivatives and hedge accounting guidance to the host contract in its concentrate or cathode sales agreements since these contracts do not allow for net settlement and always result in physical delivery. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting and is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted LBMA gold price, until the date of final pricing. Similarly, FCX purchases copper and cobalt under contracts that provide for provisional pricing. Mark-to-market price fluctuations from these embedded derivatives are recorded through the settlement date and are reflected in revenues for sales contracts and in inventory for purchase contracts.

A summary of FCX’s embedded derivatives at

December 31, 2019

, follows:

Copper Forward Contracts.

Atlantic Copper, FCX’s wholly owned smelting and refining unit in Spain, enters into copper forward contracts designed to hedge its copper price risk whenever its physical purchases and sales pricing periods do not match. These economic hedge transactions are intended to hedge against changes in copper prices, with the mark-to-market hedging gains or losses recorded in cost of sales. At

December 31, 2019

, Atlantic Copper held net copper forward sales contracts for


million

pounds at an average contract price of

$

2.75

per pound, with maturities through

February 2020

.

Summary of Gains (Losses).

A summary of the realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized in operating income for commodity contracts that do not qualify as hedge transactions, including embedded derivatives, for the years ended December 31 follows:

a.

Amounts recorded in revenues.

b.

Amounts recorded in cost of sales as production and delivery costs.



Unsettled Derivative Financial Instruments

A summary of the fair values of unsettled commodity derivative financial instruments follows:

FCX’s commodity contracts have netting arrangements with counterparties with which the right of offset exists, and it is FCX’s policy to generally offset balances by contract on its balance sheet. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional sales/purchase contracts are netted with the corresponding outstanding receivable/payable balances.

A summary of these unsettled commodity contracts that are offset in the balance sheet follows:



Credit Risk.

FCX is exposed to credit loss when financial institutions with which it has entered into derivative transactions (commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps) are unable to pay. To minimize the risk of such losses, FCX uses counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. FCX does not anticipate that any of the counterparties it deals with will default on their obligations. As of

December 31, 2019

, the maximum amount of credit exposure associated with derivative transactions was

$


million

.

Other Financial Instruments.

Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investment securities, legally restricted funds, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable and long-term debt. The carrying value for cash and cash equivalents (which included time deposits of

$

1.3

billion

at

December 31, 2019

, and

$

2.3

billion

at

December 31, 2018

), restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and dividends payable approximates fair value because of their short-term nature and generally negligible credit losses (refer to Note 15 for the fair values of investment securities, legally restricted funds and long-term debt).

In addition, as of

December 31, 2019

, FCX has contingent consideration assets related to the sales of certain oil and gas properties (refer to Note 15 for the related fair values).

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents.

The following table provides a reconciliation of total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows to the components presented in the consolidated balance sheets:



NOTE 15.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

Fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). FCX did not have any significant transfers in or out of Level 3 for


.

FCX’s financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value except for contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties (which was recorded under the loss recovery approach) and debt.

A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of FCX’s financial instruments (including those measured at NAV as a practical expedient), other than cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and dividends payable (refer to Note 14) follows:



a.

Current portion included in other current assets and long-term portion included in other assets.

b.

Excludes time deposits (which approximated fair value) included in (i) other current assets of

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

, and

$


million

at December 31,


, and (ii) other assets of

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

, and

$


million

at

December 31, 2018

, primarily associated with an assurance bond to support PT-FI’s commitment for the development of a new smelter in Indonesia (refer to Note


for further discussion) and PT-FI’s closure and reclamation guarantees (refer to Note 12 for further discussion).

c.

Refer to Note


for further discussion and balance sheet classifications.

d.

Recorded at cost except for debt assumed in acquisitions, which are recorded at fair value at the respective acquisition dates.



Valuation Techniques.

The U.S. core fixed income fund is valued at NAV. The fund strategy seeks total return consisting of income and capital appreciation primarily by investing in a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, including U.S. government obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and money market instruments. There are no restrictions on redemptions (which are usually within one business day of notice).

Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

Fixed income securities (government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds) are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets.

FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional copper concentrate, copper cathode and gold purchases and sales are valued using only quoted monthly LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted LBMA gold prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note


for further discussion); however, FCX’s contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional cobalt purchases are valued using quoted monthly LME cobalt forward prices or average published

Metals Bulletin

cobalt prices, subject to certain adjustments as specified by the terms of the contracts, at each reporting date based on the month of maturity. As a result, these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

FCX’s derivative financial instruments for copper futures and swap contracts and copper forward contracts that are traded on the respective exchanges are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted monthly COMEX or LME copper prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note


for further discussion). Certain of these contracts are traded on the over-the-counter market and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on COMEX and LME copper forward prices.

In 2016, FCX completed the sale of its onshore California oil and gas properties, which included contingent consideration of up to

$


million

, consisting of

$


million

per year for 2018, 2019 and 2020 if the price of Brent crude oil averages over

$


per barrel in each of these calendar years. The fair value of the contingent consideration derivative (included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets) was

$


million

at December 31, 2019, and

$


million

at December 31, 2018. Future changes in the fair value of this contingent consideration derivative will continue to be recorded in operating income. Also, contingent consideration of

$


million

(included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018) was realized in 2018 and collected in first-quarter 2019 (included in proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties in the consolidated statements of cash flows) because the average Brent crude oil price exceeded

$


per barrel for 2018. Contingent consideration of

$


million

was not realized in 2019 because the average Brent crude oil price did not exceeded

$


per barrel for 2019. The fair values, including the contingent consideration derivative associated with the 2016 TFHL sale (refer to Note 2 for further discussion), are calculated based on average commodity price forecasts through applicable maturity dates using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The models use various observable inputs, including Brent crude oil forward prices, historical copper and cobalt prices, volatilities, discount rates and settlement terms. As a result, these contingent consideration assets are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

In 2016, FCX completed the sale of its Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties, which included up to

$


million

in contingent consideration that was recorded at the total amount under the loss recovery approach. The contingent consideration will be received over time as future cash flows are realized in connection with a third-party production handling agreement for an offshore platform. The first collection occurred in 2018. The balance included in (i) other current assets totaled

$


million

at December 31, 2019, and

$


million

at December 31, 2018, and (ii) other assets totaled

$


million

at December 31, 2019, and

$


million

at December 31, 2018. The fair value of this contingent consideration was calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs that include third-party estimates for reserves, production rates and production timing, and discount rates. Because significant inputs are not observable in the market, the contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.



Long-term debt, including current portion, is valued using available market quotes and, as such, is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the techniques used at

December 31, 2019

.

A summary of the changes in the fair value of FCX

’

s Level 3 instrument, contingent consideration for the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties, for the years ended December 31 follows:

Refer to Notes 1 and 2 for a discussion of the fair value estimates associated with other assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the PT-FI divestment, which were determined based on inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements.

Labor Matters

.

As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately


percent

of FCX’s global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements, and approximately


percent

was covered by agreements that expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire within one year. PT-FI and union officials have commenced discussions for a new two-year labor agreement. The existing agreement, which expired in September 2019, will continue in effect until a new agreement is consummated.

Business Segments.

FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. Separately disclosed in the following tables are FCX’s reportable segments, which include the Morenci, Bagdad, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia Mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining.



Beginning in 2019, Bagdad became a reportable segment. As a result, FCX revised its segment disclosure for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, to conform with the current year presentation.

Intersegment sales between FCX’s business segments are based on terms similar to arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums.

FCX defers recognizing profits on sales from its mines to other segments, including Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining, and on


percent

of PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting, until final sales to third parties occur. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices result in variability in FCX’s net deferred profits and quarterly earnings.

FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to an operation are allocated. U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level (included in Corporate, Other & Eliminations), whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country level. In addition, most mining exploration and research activities are managed on a consolidated basis, and those costs, along with some selling, general and administrative costs, are not allocated to the operating divisions or individual segments. Accordingly, the following Financial Information by Business Segment reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity.

North America Copper Mines.

FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America – Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. The North America copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. A majority of the copper produced at the North America copper mines is cast into copper rod by FCX’s Rod & Refining segment. In addition to copper, certain of FCX’s North America copper mines also produce molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver.

The Morenci open-pit mine, located in southeastern Arizona, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Morenci mine also produces molybdenum concentrate. The Morenci mine produced


percent

of FCX’s North America copper during


.

The Bagdad open-pit mine, located in west-central Arizona, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Bagdad mine also produces molybdenum concentrate. The Bagdad mine produced


percent

of FCX’s North America copper during


.

South America Mining.

South America mining includes two operating copper mines – Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra in Chile. These operations include open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations.

The Cerro Verde open-pit copper mine, located near Arequipa, Peru, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine also produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. The Cerro Verde mine produced


percent

of FCX’s South America copper during


.

Indonesia Mining.

Indonesia mining includes PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district that produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver.

Molybdenum Mines.

Molybdenum mines include the wholly owned Henderson underground mine and Climax open-pit mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products.



Rod & Refining.

The Rod & Refining segment consists of copper conversion facilities located in North America, and includes a refinery, three rod mills and a specialty copper products facility, which are combined in accordance with segment reporting aggregation guidance. These operations process copper produced at FCX’s North America copper mines and purchased copper into copper cathode, rod and custom copper shapes. At times these operations refine copper and produce copper rod and shapes for customers on a toll basis. Toll arrangements require the tolling customer to deliver appropriate copper-bearing material to FCX’s facilities for processing into a product that is returned to the customer, who pays FCX for processing its material into the specified products.

Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining.

Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. During


, Atlantic Copper purchased


percent

of its concentrate requirements from FCX’s North America copper mines,


percent

from FCX’s South America mining operations and


percent

from FCX’s Indonesia mining operations, with the remainder purchased from unaffiliated third parties.

Corporate, Other & Eliminations.

Corporate, Other & Eliminations consists of

FCX’s

other mining, oil and gas operations and other corporate and elimination items. Other mining includes the Miami smelter (a smelter at FCX’s Miami, Arizona, mining operation), Freeport Cobalt, molybdenum conversion facilities in the U.S. and Europe, five non-operating copper mines in North America (Ajo, Bisbee, Tohono, Twin Buttes and Christmas in Arizona) and other mining support entities.

NOTE 20.

SUPPLEMENTARY MINERAL RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

Recoverable proven and probable reserves have been estimated as of

December 31, 2019

, in accordance with Industry Guide 7 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. FCX’s proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries. Proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry, as more fully discussed below. The term “reserve,” as used in the reserve data presented here, means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (i) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (ii) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (iii) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

FCX’s reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. FCX conducts ongoing studies of its ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. FCX revises its mine plans and estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies.

Estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at

December 31, 2019

, were determined using metals price assumptions of

$

2.50

per pound for copper,

$

1,200

per ounce for gold and

$


per pound for molybdenum. For the three-year period ended

December 31, 2019

, LME copper settlement prices averaged

$

2.83

per pound, LBMA gold prices averaged

$

1,306

per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by

Metals Week

averaged

$

10.50

per pound.

The recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which FCX expects to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates, where applicable. Recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that FCX estimates can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.

a.

Estimated consolidated recoverable copper reserves included

1.7

billion

pounds in leach stockpiles and

0.5

billion

pounds in mill stockpiles.

b.

for further discussion). Excluded from the table above were FCX’s estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves of


million

ounces of silver, which were determined using

$


per ounce.

d.

Net equity interest reserves represent estimated consolidated metal quantities further reduced for noncontrolling interest ownership (refer to Note


for further discussion of FCX’s ownership in subsidiaries). FCX's net equity interest for estimated metal quantities in Indonesia reflects approximately


percent

from 2020 through 2022 and

48.76

percent

from 2023 through 2041. Excluded from the table above were FCX’s estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves of

Adits.

A horizontal passage leading into a mine for the purposes of access or drainage.

Alluvial aquifers.

A water-bearing deposit of loosely arranged gravel, sand or silt left behind by a river or other flowing water.

Anode.

A positively charged metal sheet, usually lead, on which oxidation occurs. During the electro-refining process, anodes are impure copper sheets from the smelting process that require further processing to produce refined copper cathode.

Azurite.

A bluish supergene copper mineral and ore found in the oxidized portions of copper deposits often associated with malachite.

Barrel or Bbl

. One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume (used in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons).

Bench.

The horizontal floor cuttings along which mining progresses in an open-pit mine. As the pit progresses to lower levels, safety benches are left in the walls to catch any falling rock.

Blasthole stoping.

An underground mining method that extracts the ore zone in large vertical rooms. The ore is broken by blasting using large-diameter vertical drill holes.

Block cave.

A general term used to describe an underground mining method where the extraction of ore depends largely on the action of gravity. By continuously removing a thin horizontal layer at the bottom mining level of the ore column, the vertical support of the ore column is removed and the ore then caves by gravity.

Blowouts.

Accidents resulting from loss of hydraulic well control while conducting drilling operations.

Bornite.

A red-brown isometric mineral comprising copper, iron and sulfur.

British thermal unit or Btu.

One British thermal unit is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

A greenish-black copper mineral occurring in the oxidation zone of copper sulfide deposits.

Cathode.

Refined copper produced by electro-refining of impure copper or by electrowinning.

Chalcocite.

A grayish copper sulfide mineral, usually found as a supergene in copper deposits formed from the re-deposition of copper minerals that were solubilized from the oxide portion of the deposit.

Chalcopyrite.

A brass-yellow sulfide of mineral copper and iron.

Chrysocolla.

A bluish-green to emerald-green oxide copper mineral that forms incrustations and thin seams in oxidized parts of copper-mineral veins; a source of copper and an ornamental stone.

Cobalt.

A tough, lustrous, nickel-white or silvery-gray metallic element often associated with nickel and copper ores from which it is obtained as a by-product.



Concentrate.

The resulting product from the concentrating process that is composed predominantly of copper sulfide or molybdenum sulfide minerals. Further processing might include smelting and electro-refining, or roasting.

Concentrating.

The process by which ore is separated into metal concentrate through crushing, milling and flotation.

The collapse of the circulation system dug around the drilling rig for the prevention of blowouts.

Crushed-ore leach pad.

A slightly sloping pad upon which leach ores are placed in lifts for processing.

Cutoff grade.

The minimum percentage of copper contained in the ore for processing. When percentages are below this grade, the material would be routed to a high-lift or waste stockpile. When percentages are above grade, the material would be processed using concentrating or leaching methods for higher recovery.

Disseminations.

A process that uses electricity to plate copper contained in an electrolyte solution into copper cathode.

Flotation.

A concentrating process in which valuable minerals attach themselves to bubbles of an oily froth for separation as concentrate. The gangue material from the flotation process reports as a tailing product.

Grade.

The relative quality or percentage of metal content.

Leach stockpiles.

A quantity of leachable ore placed on a leach pad or in another suitable location that permits leaching and collection of solutions that contain solubilized metal.

Leaching.

The process of extracting copper using a chemical solution to dissolve copper contained in ore.

Malachite.

A bright-green copper mineral (ore) that often occurs with azurite in oxidized zones of copper deposits.

Metric ton.

The equivalent of 2,204.62 pounds.

Mill stockpile.

Millable ore that has been mined, and is available for future processing.

Mine-for-leach.

A mining operation focused on mining only leachable ores.

Mineralization.

The process by which a mineral is introduced into a rock, resulting in concentration of minerals that may form a valuable or potentially valuable deposit.

Molybdenite.

A black, platy, disulfide of molybdenum. It is the most common ore of molybdenum.

Natural gas liquids or NGLs.

Hydrocarbons (primarily ethane, propane, butane and natural gasolines) which have been extracted from wet natural gas and become liquid under various combinations of increasing pressure and lower temperature.

Ore body.

A continuous, well-defined mass of mineralized material of sufficient ore content to make extraction economically feasible.



Oxide.

In mining, oxide is used as an ore classification relating to material that usually leaches well but does not perform well in a concentrator. Oxide minerals in mining refer to an oxidized form.

Paste backfill.

A slurry of paste material produced from tailings with engineered cement and water content that is used to fill underground mined out stopes.

Porphyry.

A deposit in which minerals of copper, molybdenum, gold or, less commonly, tungsten and tin are disseminated or occur in stock-work of small veinlets within a large mass of hydro-thermally altered igneous rock. The host rock is commonly an intrusive porphyry, but other rocks intruded by a porphyry can also be hosts for ore minerals.

Production level.

With respect to underground mining, the elevation of the underground works that permit extraction/transport of the ore to a common point, shaft or plant.

Pseudomalachite.

A dark-green monoclinic copper mineral.

Roasting.

The heating of sulfide ores to oxidize sulfides to facilitate further processing.

Run-of-Mine (ROM).

Leachable ore that is mined and directly placed on a leach pad without utilizing any further processes to reduce particle size prior to leaching.

Skarn.

A Swedish mining term for silicate gangue of certain iron ore and sulfide deposits of Archaean age, particularly those that have replaced limestone and dolomite. Its meaning has been generally expanded to include lime-bearing silicates, of any geologic age, derived from nearly pure limestone and dolomite with the introduction of large amounts of silicon, aluminum, iron and magnesium.

Smelting.

The process of melting and oxidizing concentrate to separate copper and precious metals from metallic and non-metallic impurities, including iron, silica, alumina and sulfur.

Solution extraction.

A process that transfers copper from a copper-bearing ore to an organic solution, then to an electrolyte. The electrolyte is then pumped to a tankhouse where the copper is extracted, using electricity, into a copper cathode (refer to the term Electrowinning), together referred to as solution extraction/electrowinning (SX/EW).

Stope.

An underground mining method that is usually applied to highly inclined or vertical veins. Ore is extracted by driving horizontally upon it in a series of workings, one immediately over the other. Each horizontal working is called a stope because when a number of them are in progress, each working face under attack assumes the shape of a flight of stairs.

Sulfide.

A mineral compound containing sulfur and a metal. Copper sulfides can be concentrated or leached, depending on the mineral type.

Tailings.

The crushed and ground material remaining after economically recoverable minerals have been extracted. In upstream design and construction, tailings are deposited on the upstream side of the starter embankment, with subsequent crest raises progressively shifting upstream of each previous raise, using deposited tailings as a foundation. In downstream design and construction, tailings are deposited on the upstream side of the starter embankment. Borrow fill or a portion of the tailings are placed on the downstream side of the starter embankment. Subsequent crest raises progressively shift downstream of each previous raise, such that the previous raise becomes the foundation of the subsequent raise. As a result, the toe and the crest of the embankment progressively shift downstream as the embankment is raised. In centerline design and construction, tailings are deposited on the upstream side of the starter embankment. Borrow fill or a portion of the tailings are placed on the crest of the starter embankment. Subsequent crest raises are constructed vertically along the centerline of the previous raise such that the previous raise becomes the foundation of the subsequent raise. As a result, the toe of the embankment shifts downstream but the crest stays along initial alignment as the embankment is raised.

Tolling.

The process of converting customer-owned material into specified products, which is then returned to the customer.

Working interest

. An interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations.
