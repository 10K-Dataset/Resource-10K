General

Through
      our majority-owned subsidiary, PT Freeport Indonesia, we have one of the world’s
      largest copper and gold mining and production operations in terms of reserves
      and production. We are also one of the lowest-cost copper producers in the
      world, after taking into account credits for related gold and silver production.
      Our principal asset is the Grasberg minerals district. We discovered the largest
      ore body in the district, Grasberg, in 1988. Based on available year-end 2004
      reserve data, the Grasberg minerals district contains the largest single copper
      reserve and the largest single gold reserve of any mine in the
      world.

Our
      principal operating subsidiary is PT Freeport Indonesia, a limited liability
      company organized under the laws of the Republic of Indonesia and incorporated
      in Delaware. We own approximately 90.64 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia, and
      the Government of Indonesia owns the remaining approximate 9.36 percent. PT
      Freeport Indonesia mines, processes and explores for ore containing copper,
      gold
      and silver. It operates in the remote highlands of the Sudirman Mountain Range
      in the province of Papua, Indonesia, which is on the western half of the island
      of New Guinea. PT Freeport Indonesia markets its concentrates containing copper,
      gold and silver worldwide.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia conducts its operations pursuant to an agreement, called
      a
      Contract of Work, with the Government of Indonesia (see “Contracts of Work”).
      The Contract of Work allows us to conduct extensive mining, production and
      exploration activities in a 24,700-acre area that we call Block A, which
      contains the Grasberg minerals district, and governs our rights and obligations
      relating to taxes, exchange controls, royalties, repatriation and other matters.
      The Contract of Work also allows us to explore for minerals in an approximately
      500,000-acre area that we call Block B. Exploration activities in Block B have
      been suspended in recent years, but we continue to assess the possible timing
      for the resumption of those activities. The term of our Contract of Work expires
      in 2021, but we can extend it for two 10-year periods subject to Indonesian
      government approval, which cannot be withheld or delayed
      unreasonably.

Another
      of our operating subsidiaries, PT Irja Eastern Minerals, which we refer to
      as
      Eastern Minerals, holds an additional Contract of Work in Papua covering
      approximately 1.2 million acres. Eastern Minerals conducts exploration
      activities, which have been suspended in recent years, under this Contract
      of
      Work (see “Contracts of Work”). We continue to assess the possible timing for
      the resumption of exploration activities in Eastern Minerals’ exploration area.
      We have a 100 percent ownership interest in Eastern Minerals.

In
      1996,
      we established joint ventures with Rio Tinto plc, which is an international
      mining company with headquarters in London, England. Rio Tinto conducts mining
      operations in North America, South America, Asia, Australia, Europe and southern
      Africa. One of our joint ventures with Rio Tinto covers PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

mining
      operations in Block A. This joint venture gives Rio Tinto, through 2021, a
      percent interest in certain assets and in production above specified levels
      from
      operations in Block A and, after 2021, a 40 percent interest in all production
      in Block A. Under our joint venture arrangements, Rio Tinto also has a 40
      percent interest in PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

Contract
      of Work and Eastern Minerals

’

Contract
      of Work. In addition, Rio Tinto has the option to participate in 40 percent
      of
      any of our other future exploration projects in Papua. To date, Rio Tinto has
      elected to participate in all exploration projects, including PT Nabire Bakti
      Mining.

Under
      a
      joint venture agreement through PT Nabire Bakti Mining, we conduct exploration
      activities, which have been suspended in recent years (see “Contracts of Work”),
      in an area covering approximately 500,000 acres in five parcels contiguous
      to PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

Block B
      and one of Eastern Minerals

’

blocks.
      We continue to assess the possible timing for the resumption of exploration
      activities in PT Nabire Bakti Mining

’s

exploration area.

At
      December 31, 2005, PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of proven and probable
      recoverable reserves totaled 40.3 billion pounds of copper and 43.9 million
      ounces of gold, all of which are located in Block A. Our approximate 90.64
      percent equity share of these proven and probable recoverable reserves totaled
      36.5 billion pounds of copper and 39.8 million ounces of gold (see “Ore
      Reserves”). In this annual report, we refer to (1) aggregate reserves, which
      means all reserves for the operations we manage, (2) PT Freeport Indonesia’s
      share of reserves, which means the reserves net of Rio Tinto’s interest under
      our joint venture arrangements and which are the reserves reported as those
      of
      our operations in our consolidated financial statements and (3) our equity
      share
      of reserves, which is net of the 9.36 percent of PT Freeport
      Indoneisa owned by the Government of Indonesia.

In
      July
      2003, we acquired the 85.7 percent ownership interest in PT Puncakjaya Power
      owned by affiliates of Duke Energy Corporation. Puncakjaya Power is the owner
      of
      assets supplying power to PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations, including the 3x65
      megawatt coal-fired power facilities (see “Infrastructure”).

We
      also
      smelt and refine copper concentrates in Spain and market the refined copper
      products through our wholly owned subsidiary, Atlantic Copper, S.A. In addition,
      PT Freeport Indonesia has a 25 percent interest in PT Smelting, an Indonesian
      company that operates a copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia. These
      smelters play an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy, as
      approximately one-half of PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

concentrate production has been sold to Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting over
      the
      last several years (see “Investment in Smelters”).

Contracts
      of Work

Through Contracts
      of Work with the Government of Indonesia, PT Freeport Indonesia and Eastern
      Minerals conduct their current exploration operations and PT Freeport Indonesia
      conducts its mining operations in Indonesia. Both Contracts of Work govern
      our
      rights and obligations relating to taxes, exchange controls, royalties,
      repatriation and other matters. Both Contracts of Work were concluded pursuant
      to the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which expresses
      Indonesia

’s

foreign
      investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and
      protection against nationalization, a framework for economic incentives and
      basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors.
      Specifically, the Contracts of Work provide that the Government of Indonesia
      will not nationalize or expropriate PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

or
      Eastern Minerals’ mining operations. Any disputes regarding the provisions of
      the Contracts of Work are subject to international arbitration. We have
      experienced no disputes requiring arbitration during the 38 years we have
      operated in Indonesia.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

Contract
      of Work covers both Block A, which was first included in a 1967 Contract of
      Work
      that was replaced by a new Contract of Work in 1991, and Block B, to which
      we
      gained rights in 1991. The initial term of our Contract of Work expires in
      December 2021, but we can extend it for two 10-year periods subject to
      Indonesian government approval, which cannot be withheld or delayed
      unreasonably. We originally had the rights to explore 6.5 million acres in
      Block
      B, but pursuant to the Contract of Work we have only retained the rights to
      approximately 500,000 acres following significant geological
      assessment.

Eastern
      Minerals signed its Contract of Work in August 1994. The Contract of Work
      originally covered approximately 2.5 million acres. Eastern Minerals' Contract
      of Work provides for a four-to-seven year exploratory term and a 30-year term
      for mining operations. Subject to Indonesian government approval, which cannot
      be withheld or delayed unreasonably, we can extend this period for two 10-year
      periods. Eastern Minerals’ Contract of Work requires us to relinquish our rights
      to 25 percent of the original 2.5-million-acre Contract of Work area at the
      end
      of each of three specified periods. As of December 31, 2005, we had relinquished
      approximately 1.3 million acres and must relinquish an additional 0.6 million
      acres at the end of the three-year exploration period (currently in suspension),
      which can be extended by the Government of Indonesia for as many as two
      additional years.

We
      suspended our exploration activities outside of Block A in recent years because
      of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible
      conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas
      and
      an Indonesian Forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining in forest
      preservation areas. In 2001, we requested and received from the Government
      of
      Indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the Contracts
      of
      Work in all areas outside Block A. The current suspensions were granted for
      one-year periods ending February 26, 2006, for Block B; March 31, 2006, for
      PT
      Nabire Bakti Mining; and November 15, 2006, for Eastern Minerals. We have
      requested additional one-year suspensions for Block B and PT Nabire Bakti
      Mining.  Recent Indonesian legislation permits open-pit mining in PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

Block B
      area, subject to certain requirements. We continue to assess these requirements
      and security issues. The timing for our resumption of exploration activities
      in
      our Contract of Work areas outside Block A depends on the resolution of
      these matters.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia pays a copper royalty under its Contact of Work that varies
      from 1.5 percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of $0.90 or less per
      pound to 3.5 percent at a copper price of $1.10 or more per pound. The Contract
      of Work royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 1.0 percent.

A
      large
      part of the mineral royalties under Government of Indonesia regulations are
      designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted. In connection
      with our “fourth concentrator mill expansion,” PT Freeport Indonesia agreed to
      pay the Government of Indonesia additional royalties (royalties not required
      by
      our Contract of Work) to provide further support to the local governments and
      the people of Papua. PT Freeport Indonesia pays the additional royalties on
      metal from production above 200,000 metric tons of ore per day. The additional
      royalty for copper equals the Contract of Work royalty rate and for gold and
      silver equals twice the Contract of Work royalty rates. Therefore, our royalty
      rate on copper net revenues from production above 200,000 metric tons of ore
      per
      day is double the Contract of Work royalty rate, and our royalty rates on gold
      and silver sales from production above 200,000 metric tons of ore per day are
      triple the Contract of Work royalty rates.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

share of
      the combined royalties, including the additional royalties which became
      effective January 1, 1999, totaled $103.7 million in 2005, $43.5 million in
      and $26.5 million in 2003.

Republic
      of Indonesia

General.

The
      Republic of Indonesia consists of more than 17,000 islands stretching 3,000
      miles along the equator from Malaysia to Australia and is the fourth most
      populous nation in the world with over 240 million people. Following many years
      of Dutch colonial rule, Indonesia gained independence in 1945 and now has a
      presidential republic system of government.

Our
      mining complex was Indonesia

’s

first
      copper mining project and was the first major foreign investment in Indonesia
      following the economic development program instituted by the Indonesian
      government in 1967. We work closely with the central, provincial and local
      governments in development efforts in the area surrounding our operations.
      We
      have had positive relations with the Indonesian government since we commenced
      business activities in Indonesia in 1967, and we intend to continue to maintain
      positive working relationships with the central, provincial and local branches
      of the Indonesian government.

Political
      Developments.

In May
      1998, President Suharto, Indonesia

’s

political leader for more than 30 years, resigned in the wake of an economic
      crisis in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia and in the face of growing
      social unrest. Vice President B.J. Habibie succeeded Suharto. In June 1999,
      Indonesia held a new parliamentary election on a generally peaceful basis as
      the
      first step in the process of electing a new president. In October 1999, in
      accordance with the Indonesian constitution, the country

’s

highest
      political institution (the People

’s

Consultative Assembly), composed of the newly elected national parliament along
      with additional provincial and other representatives, elected Abdurrahman Wahid
      as president and Megawati Sukarnoputri as vice president in the national's
      first
      direct persidential election.

There
      were repeated challenges to the political leadership of President Wahid after
      his election in October 1999. In July 2001, the People

’s

Consultative Assembly voted to remove President Wahid, and elected Vice
      President Megawati Sukarnoputri as president. In October 2004, Susilo Bambang
      Yudhoyono was elected as president in the nation's first direct persidential
      election.

Other
      Developments.

In
      February 2006, a group of illegal gold panners engaged in conflict with
      Indonesian police and PT Freeport Indonesia security personnel when they were
      requested to leave an area near our milling facilities. Following the incident,
      the illegal panners blocked the road leading to the Grasberg mine and mill
      in
      protest and we temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a
      precautionary measure. The panners also vandalized some of our light vehicles
      and offices near this area, causing approximately $4 million in damages. Our
      port facilities continued to operate during the disruption and concentrate
      shipments were not affected. The panners, mostly Papuans from outside our area
      of operations, presented a list of aspirations, primarily relating to their
      desire to share in the benefits of our existing initiatives and programs
      provided for the Papuans who are the traditional residents of our operations
      area. Mining and milling operations resumed after an approximate four-day
      outage. During the incident at our mine and mill, protestors in Jakarta
      vandalized the entrance floor of the office building housing our Indonesian
      headquarters and staged a three-day rally outside the building. The Indonesian
      police handled this matter, which did not disrupt our administrative functions
      or damage any of our facilities.

On
      August
      31, 2002, three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush
      by a
      group of unidentified assailants. The assailants shot at several vehicles
      transporting international contract teachers from PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

school
      in Tembagapura, their family members, and other contractors to PT Freeport
      Indonesia on the road near Tembagapura, the mining town where the majority
      of PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

personnel reside. Indonesian authorities and the United States Federal Bureau
      of
      Investigation (FBI) investigated the incident, which resulted in the U.S.
      indictment of an alleged operational commander in the Free Papua
      Movement/National Freedom Force. In January 2006, Indonesian Police arrested
      this individual and 11 other Papuans.

On
      October 12, 2002, a bombing killed 202 people in the Indonesian province of
      Bali, which is 1,500 miles west of our mining and milling operations. Indonesian
      authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those
      arrested have been tried and convicted. On August 5, 2003, 12 people were killed
      and over 100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the JW
      Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. On September 9, 2004, 11 people were
      killed and over 200 others injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the
      Australian embassy. On October 1, 2005, three suicide bombers killed 19 people
      and wounded over 100 others in Bali. International terrorist organizations
      are suspected in each of these incidents. In November 2005, Indonesian Police
      raided a house in East Java that resulted in the death of other accused
      terrorists linked to these bombings. Our mining and milling operations were
      not
      interrupted by these incidents, but our corporate offices in Jakarta sustained
      damages and relocated for several months as a result of the September 2004
      bombing.



The
      Government of Indonesia, which provides security for PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

personnel and operations (see “Security Matters”), has expressed a strong
      commitment to protect natural resources businesses operating in Indonesia,
      including PT Freeport Indonesia, with heightened security following the
      incidents discussed above.

Economic
      and Social Conditions.

The
      Indonesian economy grew by an estimated 6 percent in 2005 and 5 percent in
      2004.
      The Indonesian currency, the rupiah, averaged approximately 9,700 rupiah to
      one
      United States (U.S.) dollar during 2005 and closed at 9,825 rupiah to one U.S.
      dollar on December 30, 2005, compared with 9,270 rupiah to one U.S. dollar
      on
      December 31, 2004.

Despite
      gradual improvements on the economic front, Indonesia

’s

recovery
      remains vulnerable to ongoing political and social tensions. Incidents of
      violence and separatist pressures continue to occur. Pro-independence
      movements have been prominent in certain areas, especially in the province
      of
      Aceh, and to a lesser extent in Papua. In 2005, the Government of Indonesia
      and
      the Free Aceh Movement reached a peace agreement which included the withdrawal
      of 24,000 military troops from Aceh.  Subsequently, the U.S. restored full
      relations with the Indonesian military after a 14-year moratorium, partly
      because of the successes by the Government of Indonesia in fighting terrorism
      and in reaching a peaceful agreement in Aceh.

The
      area
      surrounding our mining development is sparsely populated by indigenous
      people and former residents of other areas of Indonesia, some of whom have
      resettled in Papua under the Government of Indonesia

’s

transmigration program. A segment of the local population is opposing Indonesian
      rule over Papua, and several separatist groups have sought political
      independence for the province. In addition to the August 31, 2002, shooting
      incident, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and
      sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the Indonesian
      military in Papua.

In
      2001,
      new autonomy laws became effective in Indonesia. The laws were intended to
      shift
      a greater share of revenues and greater control of economic, regulatory and
      social affairs to Indonesia’s 31 provinces and over 300 regencies. The
      central government and the provinces continue to consider
      the implementation and administration of these new
      responsibilities.

Our
      Contracts of Work and the Government of Indonesia.

The
      Indonesian government has repeatedly assured investors that existing contracts
      would be honored. In our 38 years of operating in Indonesia, the Indonesian
      government has always honored its commitments to us. Our belief that our
      Contracts of Work will continue to be honored is further supported by U.S.
      laws,
      which prohibit U.S. aid to countries that nationalize property owned by, or
      take
      steps to nullify a contract with, a U.S. citizen or company at least 50 percent
      owned by U.S. citizens if the foreign country does not within a reasonable
      time
      take appropriate steps to provide full value compensation or other relief under
      international law.

In
      July
      2004, we received a request from the Indonesian Department of Energy and Mineral
      Resources that we offer to sell shares in PT Indocopper Investama to Indonesian
      nationals at fair market value. PT Indocopper Investama, which we wholly own,
      has an approximate 9.36 percent ownership interest in PT Freeport Indonesia.
      In
      response to this request and in view of the potential benefits of having
      additional Indonesian ownership in our operations, we have agreed to consider
      a
      potential sale of an interest in PT Indocopper Investama at fair market value.
      Neither our Contract of Work nor Indonesian law requires us to divest any
      portion of our ownership interest in PT Freeport Indonesia or PT Indocopper
      Investama. We have received no offers for our ownership interest.

Our
      Investment in Indonesia and Papua.

We have
      a board-approved policy on social, employment and human rights, and have
      comprehensive and extensive social, cultural and community development programs,
      to which we have committed significant financial and managerial resources.
      See
“Social Development, Employment and Human Rights.” These policies and programs
      are designed to address the impact of our operations on the local villages
      and
      people and to provide assistance for the development of the local people. While
      we believe these efforts serve to avoid damage to and disruptions of
      our operations, our operations could be adversely affected by social,
      economic and political forces beyond our control.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia contributes to the economies of Papua and the Republic of
      Indonesia through the payment of taxes, dividends and royalties; economic
      development programs; infrastructure development; employment and the purchase
      of
      local and national goods. PT Freeport Indonesia has frequently been one of
      the largest taxpayers in the Republic of Indonesia. In addition, it pays
      royalties on all minerals removed from the ground. Royalty payments are based
      on
      the volumes and prices of minerals sold in accordance with the terms of PT
      Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work, as discussed above.

Since
      it
      began development activities more than 35 years ago, PT Freeport Indonesia
      has
      made significant investments in infrastructure both for its use and for use
      by
      the Papuan public. These infrastructure improvements include medical facilities,
      roads, an airport and heliports, schools, housing, community buildings and
      places of worship.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia is also one of the largest private employers in Indonesia
      and
      by far the largest in Papua. As of December 31, 2005, PT Freeport Indonesia
      directly employed 8,044 people; and 6,225 contract workers provided services
      to
      PT Freeport Indonesia. In addition, 4,475 persons worked for privatized
      companies providing services within PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

operations area.

Besides
      the estimated $3.9 billion in direct benefits from taxes, royalties, dividends
      and fees payable to the Indonesian government under the Contract of Work from
      1992 through 2005, PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations have provided another
      $10.0 billion during this period in indirect benefits to Papua and the Republic
      of Indonesia in the form of wages and benefits paid to workers, purchases of
      goods and services, charitable contributions and reinvestments in operations.
      For 2005, direct benefits totaled approximately $1.2 million and indirect
      benefits totaled approximately $736 million.

Ore
      Reserves

During
      2005, net additions and revisions to the aggregate proven and probable reserves
      of the Grasberg and other Block A ore bodies in the Grasberg minerals district
      totaled approximately 132 million metric tons of ore representing increases
      of
      2.1 billion recoverable pounds of copper, 0.4 million recoverable ounces of
      gold
      and 12.1 million recoverable ounces of silver. The additions were primarily
      the
      result of positive drilling results at the Mill Level Zone and Deep Mill Level
      Zone deposits, a 345-million-metric-ton complex with average ore grades of
      1.06
      percent copper and 0.83 grams per metric ton (g/t) of gold, and at the Grasberg
      underground extension to the Kucing Liar deposit, a 579-million-metric-ton
      complex with average ore grades of 1.20 percent copper and 1.06 g/t of gold.
      Completion of a successful feasibility study at Big Gossan also contributed
      to
      these gains. Year-end aggregate proven and probable recoverable reserves, net
      of
      2005 production, were 2.8 billion metric tons of ore averaging 1.07 percent
      copper, 0.92 g/t of gold and 4.02 g/t of silver representing 56.6 billion pounds
      of copper, 58.0 million ounces of gold and 180.8 million ounces of silver.
      Our
      aggregate exploration budget for 2006, including Rio Tinto

’s

share,
      is expected to total approximately $15 million ($10 million for our share)
      with
      most of the efforts focused on potential extensions of the Grasberg underground
      and Kucing Liar mine complex, and testing downward extensions of the previously
      mined Ertsberg deposit. We continue to assess the timing of resumption of
      suspended exploration activities in areas outside the existing producing area
      of
      the Grasberg minerals district.

Pursuant
      to joint venture arrangements between PT Freeport Indonesia and Rio Tinto,
      Rio
      Tinto has a 40 percent interest in production from reserves above those reported
      at December 31, 1994. Net of Rio Tinto

’s

share,
      PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

share of
      proven and probable recoverable reserves as of December 31, 2005, was 40.3
      billion pounds of copper, 43.9 million ounces of gold and 127.0 million ounces
      of silver. FCX

’s

equity
      interest in proven and probable recoverable reserves as of December 31, 2005,
      was 36.5 billion pounds of copper, 39.8 million ounces of gold and 115.1 million
      ounces of silver. We estimated recoverable reserves using a copper price of
      $0.90 per pound and a gold price of $350 per ounce. If metal prices were
      adjusted to the approximate average London spot prices for the past three years,
      i.e., copper prices adjusted from $0.90 per pound to $1.26 per pound and gold
      prices adjusted from $350 per ounce to $406 per ounce, the resulting additional
      proven and probable reserves would not be material to our reported
      reserves.

All
      of
      our proven and probable recoverable reserves lie within Block A. Aggregate
      Grasberg open pit and underground proven and probable recoverable ore reserves
      as of December 31, 2005, are shown below along with those of our other deposits.
      Reserve calculations were prepared by our employees under the supervision of
      George D. MacDonald, our Vice President of Exploration, and were reviewed and
      verified by Independent Mining Consultants, Inc., experts in mining, geology
      and
      reserve determination. See “Risk Factors.” We developed our current mine plan
      based on completing the mining of all of our currently designated recoverable
      reserves before the end of 2041, which would be the expiration of our Contract
      of Work including the two 10-year extensions discussed above. Prior to the
      expiration of the initial term of our Contract of Work in December 2021, under
      our current mine plan we expect to mine approximately 44 percent of aggregate
      proven and probable ore, representing approximately 52 percent of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

      recoverable copper reserves and approximately 65 percent of PT Freeport

Proven

                97.0
                percent for gold and 76.9 percent for silver. The term “recoverable
                reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit which we estimate can be
                economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the
                reserve
                determination.

In
      defining its open-pit reserves, PT Freeport Indonesia applies an “economic
      cutoff grade” strategy. The objective of this strategy is to maximize the net
      present value of its operations. PT Freeport Indonesia uses a break-even cutoff
      grade to define the insitu reserves for its underground ore bodies. The
      break-even cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent
      copper grade, once produced and sold, that generates sufficient revenue to
      cover
      all operating and administrative costs associated with its
      production.

Our
      reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical
      studies. We conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic
      values and to manage risk. We revise our mine plans and estimates of proven
      and
      probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the
      latest available studies.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia’s ores contain three commercially recoverable metals; copper,
      gold and silver. We value all three metals in terms of a copper equivalent
      percentage to determine a single break-even cutoff grade. Copper equivalent
      percentage is used to express the relative value of multi-metal ores in terms
      of
      one metal. The calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using
      estimates of contained metal quantities, metals prices as used for reserve

The
      following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing for each of our ore
      bodies. Drill hole spacing data are used by mining professionals, such as
      mining engineers, in determining the suitability of data coverage (on a relative
      basis) in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve
      a
      given level of confidence in the resource estimate. Drill hole spacing is only
      one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification.
      Drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing
      to
      support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular
      stage of development of a mineral deposit. We calculate the average drill hole
      spacing within each ore body using the distance from the center of each block
      in
      the resource model to the nearest drill hole composite. We then calculate the
      averages of these values within the volume of each ore body and reported them
      under the column entitled “Average Distance: To Nearest Sample.” This value
      represents at least one-half of the average drill hole spacing within each
      deposit. We calculate the value under the column entitled “Average Distance:
      Between Drill Holes” by multiplying the average minimum distance value by two,
      and this value represents the maximum average drill hole spacing.

Mining
      Operations - Mines in Production

We
      and
      our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in Block
      A
      since 1967 and have been the only operator of these operations. We currently
      have two mines in operation: the Grasberg open pit and the Deep Ore
      Zone.

Grasberg
      Open Pit.

We
      began
      open-pit mining of the Grasberg ore body in 1990. Open-pit operations are
      expected to continue until 2015 at which time the Grasberg underground mining
      operations are scheduled to begin.



Production
      is currently at the 3,385- to 4,060-meter elevation level and totaled 60.3
      million metric tons of ore in 2005 and 48.9 million metric tons of ore in 2004,
      which provided 81 percent of our 2005 mill feed and 76 percent of our 2004
      mill
      feed. Our open-pit mining rate, including ore and overburden, totaled 691,600
      metric tons per day in 2005 and 592,700 metric tons per day in 2004. Annual
      production rates are expected to range between 650,000 metric tons per day
      and
      750,000 metric tons per day through 2010 and then decline through 2015. The
      Grasberg open pit is fully developed and we expect to incur only
      maintenance capital costs with respect to the Grasberg open pit during its
      remaining life.

The
      current Grasberg equipment fleet consists of over 800 pieces of equipment.
      As of
      December 31, 2005, the larger mining equipment directly associated with
      production of the Grasberg open pit includes 164 haul trucks with payloads
      ranging from approximately 70 metric tons to 330 metric tons, 18 shovels with
      bucket sizes ranging from 15 cubic meters to 42 cubic meters and 62
      bulldozers and graders. We believe our current equipment level is adequate
      to
      meet our projected production levels over the remaining life of the
      pit.

Grasberg
      crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity
      to transport up to 225,000 metric tons per day of Grasberg ore to the mill
      and
      135,000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden
      stockpiles.

Mining
      costs are charged to operations as incurred. However, because of the
      configuration and location of the Grasberg open-pit ore body and the location
      and extent of the related surrounding overburden, the ratio of overburden to
      ore
      is much higher in the initial mining of the open pit than in later years. In
      2005 and years prior, surface mining costs associated with overburden removal
      at
      PT Freeport Indonesia’s Grasberg open-pit mine that were estimated to relate to
      future production were initially deferred when the ratio of actual overburden
      removed to ore mined exceeded the estimated average ratio of overburden removed
      to ore mined over the life of the Grasberg open-pit mine, as projected in our
      most recent mine plan. Those deferred costs were to be charged
      subsequently to operating costs when the ratio of actual overburden removed
      to
      ore mined fell below the estimated average ratio of overburden to ore over
      the life of the Grasberg open-pit mine. The reserve quantities used to develop
      the life of mine ratio are the proven and probable ore quantities for the
      Grasberg open pit shown above.

In
      the
      mining industry, the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access
      mineral deposits are referred to as “stripping costs.” Through 2005, we applied
      the deferred mining cost method in accounting for our post-production stripping
      costs. The deferred mining cost method has been used by some companies
      in the metals mining industry; however, industry practice has varied. The
      deferred mining cost method matches the cost of production with the sale of
      the
      related metal from the open pit by assigning each metric ton of ore removed
      an
      equivalent amount of overburden tonnage, thereby averaging overburden removal
      costs over the life of the mine. The mining cost capitalized in inventory and
      the amounts charged to cost of goods sold do not represent the actual costs
      incurred to mine the ore in any given period. The application of the deferred
      mining cost method resulted in an asset on our balance sheets (“Deferred
      Mining Costs”) totaling $285.4 million at December 31, 2005 and $220.4 million
      at December 31, 2004 (see Note 1).

In
      March
      2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified Emerging Issues
      Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-6, “Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred
      during Production in the Mining Industry,” (EITF 04-6) (see Note 1) which
      requires that stripping costs incurred during production be considered costs
      of
      the extracted minerals and recognized as a component of inventory to be
      recognized in cost of sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale
      of
      inventory. As a result, capitalization of stripping costs incurred during
      production is appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the
      end
      of a reporting period. The guidance in EITF 04-6 is effective for financial
      statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Companies
      may apply this guidance either by recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment
      to beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption or by restating prior
      period financial statements. We adopted the guidance on January 1, 2006, with
      the most significant impacts of adoption being the deferred mining costs asset
      on our balance sheet on that date ($285.4 million) was recorded, net of taxes,
      minority interest share and inventory effects ($135.9 million), as a cumulative
      effect adjustment to reduce our retained earnings. Stripping costs incurred
      in
      2006 and later periods will now effectively be charged to cost of sales as
      incurred. Adoption of the new guidance has no impact on our cash flows. The
      pro
      forma impact of applying EITF 04-6 would be to reduce net income by $35.3
      million or $0.16 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2005, $39.4
      million or $0.21 per share for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $33.8
      million or $0.21 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2003. These
      pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what charges may be for
      future periods.



Deep
      Ore Zone.

The
      Deep
      Ore Zone ore body lies vertically below the now depleted Intermediate Ore Zone
      ore body. We began production from the Deep Ore Zone ore body in 1989, but
      we
      suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the Grasberg deposit.
      Production using the block-cave method resumed in September 2000.
      Production is at the 3,110-meter elevation level and totaled 15.3 million metric
      tons of ore in 2005 and 15.9 million metric tons of ore in 2004. The Deep Ore
      Zone has performed above design capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per
      day.  We are expanding the Deep Ore Zone operation to a sustained rate of
      50,000 metric tons of ore per day with the installation of a second crusher
      and
      additional ventilation. Production from the Deep Ore Zone averaged 42,000 metric
      tons of ore per day in 2005 and 43,600 metric tons of ore per day in
      2004.

The
      Deep
      Ore Zone mine fleet consists of over 140 pieces of mobile heavy equipment.
      The
      primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development
      includes 41 load-haul-dump (LHD) units and 14 haul trucks. Our LHD units
      typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore. Using orepasses and chutes,
      the LHD units transfer ore into 55-ton capacity haul trucks. The trucks dump
      into a gyratory crusher and ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles.

During
      2005 at the Deep Ore Zone mine, we completed over 10,000 meters of development
      drifting in support of the block-cave mining method and the ongoing expansion
      to
      50,000 metric tons of ore per day. The expansion to a sustained rate of 50,000
      metric tons of ore per day with the installation of a second crusher and
      additional ventilation is expected to be completed in 2007. The aggregate
      development costs for the Deep Ore Zone expansion is expected to approximate
      $62
      million (approximately $37 million for PT Freeport Indonesia’s share) through
      the projected 2007 ramp-up. The Deep Ore Zone mine, a block cave operation,
      is
      one of the world’s largest underground mines.

Our
      development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production
      activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable reserves including
      adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of
      overburden. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets is
      determined using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable
      proven and probable copper reserves. Development costs that relate to a specific
      ore body are depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on estimated
      recoverable proven and probable copper reserves for the ore body benefited.
      PT
      Freeport Indonesia’s total development costs at December 31, 2005 for the Deep
      Ore Zone mine, currently our only operating underground mine, totaled
      approximately $220 million, which are being depreciated on a unit-of-production
      basis over the life of the Deep Ore Zone proven and probable reserves (see
      Note
      1).

The
      majority of maintenance activities are performed on site by a combination of
      PT
      Freeport Indonesia employees and contract workers. As of December 31, 2005,
      we
      had approximately 7,500 employees and contract workers directly involved in
      Grasberg open-pit and Deep Ore Zone underground mining, milling and ore flow
      operations.

The
      Intermediate Ore Zone was an underground block-cave operation that began
      production in 1994. The Intermediate Ore Zone was depleted in 2003.
      Production totaled 2.5 million metric tons of ore in 2003. During its 10-year
      life, the Intermediate Ore Zone operation produced almost 30 percent more copper
      and gold than the initial reserve estimates.

Our
      principal source of power for all our operations is a coal-fired power plant
      that we built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator expansion (see
“Infrastructure”). Diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical
      power generating capacity. A combination of naturally occurring mountain streams
      and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our
      operations. The average annual rainfall in the project area is 180
      inches.

Mining
      Operations - Mines in Development

Seven
      other ore bodies (the underground Grasberg, Kucing Liar, Mill Level Zone, Deep
      Mill Level Zone, Ertsberg Stockwork Zone, Big Gossan and the Dom) are located
      in
      Block A. These ore bodies are at various stages of development, and are included
      in our proven and probable recoverable reserves. We continually review our
      operations development opportunities to maximize the value of the reserves.
      We incurred $12.6 million for mine development, expansion and infrastructure
      capital expenditures related to these ore bodies and $45.2 million for common
      underground infrastructure development during the three years ended December
      31,
      2005. See “Risk Factors.”

The
      underground Grasberg reserves will be mined using the block-cave method at
      the
      end of open-pit mining, which


Table
      of Contents

is
      expected to continue until approximately 2015. The Kucing Liar ore body lies
      on
      the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the Grasberg open
      pit at the 2,605- to 3,115-meter elevation level. We expect to mine the Kucing
      Liar ore body using the block-cave method.

The
      Mill
      Level Zone ore body lies directly below the Deep Ore Zone mine at the
      2,890-meter elevation. The Deep Mill Level Zone ore body lies beneath the Mill
      Level Zone ore body at the 2,590-meter elevation. This ore represents the
      downward continuation of mineralization in the Ertsberg East Skarn system and
      neighboring Ertsberg porphyry. Drilling efforts continue to determine the extent
      of these ore bodies. We expect to mine the Mill Level Zone ore body using a
      block-cave method near completion of mining at the Deep Ore Zone ore body.
      Near
      the end of mining the Mill Level Zone ore body, we expect to mine the Deep
      Mill
      Level Zone ore body also using a block-cave method.

The
      Ertsberg Stockwork Zone ore body extends off the southwest side of the Deep
      Ore
      Zone ore body at the 3,126- to 3,626-meter elevation level. Drilling efforts
      continue to determine the extent of this ore body, which we expect to mine
      using
      a block-cave method starting in about 2009.

The
      Big
      Gossan ore body is located approximately 1,000 meters southwest of the original
      Ertsberg open-pit deposit. We began the initial underground development of
      the
      ore body in 1993 when we drove tunnels from the mill area into the ore zone
      at
      the 3,000-meter elevation level. A stope and fill mining method will be used
      on
      the Big Gossan deposit. In 2005, we completed a feasibility study and an update
      to the site-wide development plan to determine the timing of initial production,
      currently projected to be 2008.

The
      Dom
      ore body lies approximately 1,500 meters southeast of the depleted Ertsberg
      open-pit deposit. Production at the open-pit and underground portions of the
      ore
      body will begin after completion of open-pit mining at Grasberg.

The
      projected aggregate capital expenditures required to reach full production
      capacity for each of our undeveloped ore bodies based on our latest mine plans
      and our proven and probable recoverable reserves as of December 31, 2005, are
      shown below in millions of U.S. dollars. Actual costs could differ materially
      from these estimates as we will not incur most of the expenditures for several
      years and we will incur them over a period of several years. In addition to
      the
      mine development costs below, our current mine development plans include
      approximately $1 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities
      to
      optimize the handling of underground ore types once Grasberg open-pit operations
      cease. We continue to review our processing plans to maximize the value of
      our
      reserves. Based on our current estimates, we expect aggregate expenditures
      will
      range between $40 million and $330 million annually, during the next 15 years.
      In addition, these costs will be shared with Rio Tinto in accordance with our
      joint venture agreement.

Description
      of Ore Bodies.

Our
      ore
      bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions, the Grasberg
      monzodiorite and the Ertsberg diorite. The host rocks of these ore bodies
      include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper
      flanks of the Sudirman Range, and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic
      composition that intrude them. The igneous-hosted ore bodies (the Grasberg
      open
      pit and block cave, and the Ertsberg Stockwork Zone block cave) occur as vein
      stockworks and disseminations of copper sulphides, dominated by chalcopyrite
      and, to a much lesser extent, bornite. The sedimentary-rock hosted ore bodies
      occur as “magnetite-rich, calcium/magnesian skarn” replacements, whose location
      and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry
      of
      the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions.

The
      copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is also dominated by chalcopyrite,
      but higher bornite concentrations are common. Moreover, gold occurs in
      significant concentrations in all of the district

’s

ore
      bodies, though rarely visible to the naked eye. These gold concentrations
      usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulphide minerals, though, in
      some
      deposits, these concentrations can also be strongly associated with
      pyrite.



The
      following diagram indicates the relative elevations (in meters) of our reported
      reserve ore bodies.



The
      following map, which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers
      (approximately 16 square miles), indicates the relative positions and sizes
      of
      our reported reserve ore bodies and their locations.



The
      following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing
      each
      of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect that production
      of
      each ore body will begin and end. Production volumes are typically lower in
      the
      first few years of each ore body as development activities are ongoing and
      as
      the mine ramps up to full production. Currently, the Grasberg open pit and
      Deep
      Ore Zone are our only producing mines. The ultimate timing of the start of
      production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors,
      including the results of our exploration efforts, and may vary from the dates
      shown below. In addition, we develop our mine plans for the Grasberg open pit
      and underground mines based on maximizing the net present value from the ore
      bodies.

During
      2005, we mined an average of 733,600 metric tons of material per day, including
      ore and overburden.  We do not require any additional approvals for higher
      mining rates. During 2004, we mined an average of 636,200 metric tons of
      material per day. The following chart illustrates our current aggregate mill
      capacity; our aggregate permitted mill capacity and our projected milling rates.
      Mill capacity will vary with the ore type being processed. The decline in
      milling rates in 2016 reflects the expected completion date of open-pit mining
      at the Grasberg ore body. We are continuing to develop mine plans to optimize
      production levels.

Milling
      and Production

The
      ore
      from our mines moves by a conveyor system to a series of shafts through which
      it
      drops to our milling and concentrating complex located approximately 2,900
      meters above sea level. At the mill, the ore is crushed and ground and mixed
      in
      tanks with water and small amounts of flotation reagents where it is
      continuously agitated with air. During this physical separation process,
      copper-, gold- and silver-bearing particles rise to the top of the tanks and
      are
      collected and thickened into a concentrate. The concentrate leaves the mill
      complex as a slurry, consisting of approximately 65 percent solids by weight,
      and is pumped through three parallel 115-kilometer pipelines to our coastal
      port
      site facility at Amamapare where it is filtered, dried and stored for shipping.
      Ships are loaded at dock facilities at the port until they draw their maximum
      dock-side water, and they then move to deeper water, where loading is completed
      from shuttling barges.

Our
      production results for the last three years are as follows:

Mill
      throughput and production improved significantly in 2005 compared to 2004,
      which
      was negatively affected by PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

efforts
      to accelerate removal of overburden material and restore safe access to
      higher-grade areas in the pit (see below). Mill throughput averaged 216,200
      metric tons of ore per day in 2005, a 17 percent increase from the 185,100
      metric tons average in 2005. Copper and gold production was higher in 2005
      compared with 2004 reflecting the higher mill throughput and higher average
      ore
      grades. Copper production for 2005 totaled 1.46 billion pounds, 459.4 million
      pounds higher than 2004 production. Gold production for 2005 totaled 2.79
      million ounces, 1.3 million ounces higher than 2004 production. The higher
      sales
      volumes and the primarily fixed nature of a large portion of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

cost
      structure resulted in average unit net cash costs for 2005 decreasing to $0.07
      per pound compared with $0.40 per pound for 2004.

In
      October 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a section of the Grasberg
      open
      pit and in December 2003, a smaller debris flow occurred in the same section.
      The area affected by the slippage events included two active mining areas which
      were scheduled to be mined in the fourth quarter of 2003 (see “Grasberg Open-Pit
      Slippage”). Mill throughput and production in 2003 and 2004 were negatively
      affected by PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

efforts
      to accelerate removal of overburden material and restore safe access to
      higher-grade areas in the pit. Mill throughput averaged 185,100 metric tons
      of
      ore per day in 2004, a nine percent decrease from the 203,000 metric tons
      average in 2003. Copper and gold production was lower in 2004 compared with
      reflecting the lower mill throughput and lower average ore grades. Copper
      production for 2004 totaled 1.0 billion pounds, 295 million pounds lower than
      2003 production. Gold production for 2004 totaled 1.46 million ounces, 1.0
      million ounces lower than 2003 production. The lower sales volumes and the
      primarily fixed nature of a large portion of PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

cost
      structure resulted in average unit net cash costs for 2004 increasing to $0.40
      per pound compared with a net credit of $(0.02) per pound for 2003. Average
      unit
      net cash costs per pound of copper totaled a net credit of $(0.02) per pound
      for
      2003, which was an annual record low.

Because
      of the fixed nature of a large portion of our costs, unit costs vary
      significantly from period to period depending on volumes of copper and gold
      sold
      during the period. In addition, we have experienced significant increases in
      our
      production costs in recent years primarily as a result of higher energy costs
      and costs of other consumables, higher mining costs and milling rates, labor
      costs and other factors. Once we complete our open-pit mining operations at
      the
      Grasberg mine in approximately 2015 and transition to underground, we expect
      our
      share of annual copper and gold production to be lower than current levels,
      and
      all other factors being equal, our average unit net cash costs to increase.
      For
      more information regarding our operating and financial results, see our 2005
      Annual Report incorporated herein by reference.

We
      estimate our share of sales for 2006 to approximate 1.3 billion pounds of copper
      and 1.7 million ounces of gold. Average annual sales volumes over the five-year
      period from 2006 through 2010 are expected to approximate 1.3 billion pounds
      of
      copper and 1.9 million ounces of gold. As a result of lower than targeted mining
      rates, ore from a high-grade section in the primary ore area (“6 North”) of the
      Grasberg open pit, previously expected to be mined in late 2006 has been
      deferred to early 2007. Accordingly, our current mine plans alter the timing
      of
      subsequent years’ ore production compared with previous plans. These revised
      production estimates do not have a significant economic effect since the
      deferrals occur within months of overlapping annual periods. Efforts are under
      way to improve productivity of mining activities which would increase mining
      rates and advance the timing of metal production. See “Risk
      Factors.”

Geotechnical
      Programs

Our
      geotechnical programs support several phases of the operations, including our
      open-pit mine (pit slope and overburden stockpile stability), our underground
      mine, our infrastructure and our tailings management program. For information
      regarding our tailings management program, see “Environmental
      Matters.”

A
      group
      of our senior level employees has the responsibility, authority and oversight
      for our overall geotechnical programs. Our multi-disciplinary approach combines
      in-house personnel with backgrounds in civil, geotechnical, mining engineering,
      geology and hydrology to form a technical services group that reports to our
      senior managers. Our technical services group develops information that our
      mine
      engineering group uses to develop mine and stockpile designs, production
      schedules and related plans. Our technical services group also monitors slope
      stability and other geotechnical and hydrological developments.

Our
      technical services group is composed of expatriates and Indonesian nationals,
      who are university educated. International consulting experts in each of the
      applicable technical fields support this group. In-house training provided
      by
      consultants as well as off-site seminars and industry conferences supports
      the
      training of our staff. Our


Table
      of Contents

joint
      venture partner has also provided geotechnical and engineering support to our
      operations. Consultants and our joint venture partner provide input into program
      development and assess performance of these critical roles.

Our
      technical services group uses information from geological drilling for the
      development and updating of our geological, geotechnical and hydrologic models.
      We develop computer-based geologic models for mine design and dewatering
      programs. We provide continuous ground and slope monitoring in our mines and
      on
      overburden stockpiles using various computerized and automated systems. We
      also
      daily inspect all open-pit working areas, with any items of concern being
      reported to our senior managers. Our hydrology function measures and tracks
      water flow patterns to determine the effectiveness and need for de-watering
      and
      depressurization programs. We drain all surface flows away from the open pit
      and
      pump any in-pit surface water to dedicated drain holes connected to our
      underground de-watering drift system. We also continuously monitor rainfall
      at
      our operations so that we may adjust for operational impacts and safety
      considerations.

Grasberg
      Open-Pit Slippage

On
      October 9, 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a section of the Grasberg
      open pit. Eight workers perished and five workers were injured in the incident.
      The area affected by the slippage, comprising approximately five percent of
      the
      surface area of the massive Grasberg pit, included two active mining areas
      that
      were scheduled to be mined in 2003 and 2004. On December 12, 2003, a debris
      flow
      involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same
      area
      of the Grasberg open pit resulting in only minor property damage. Following
      these two events, PT Freeport Indonesia redirected its open-pit operations
      to
      accelerate removal of waste material from the south wall to restore safe access
      to the higher-grade ore areas in the pit. These activities resulted in reduced
      production levels. In April 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia established safe access
      and initiated mining in higher-grade ore areas while continuing waste removal
      activities. PT Freeport Indonesia resumed normal milling rates in June
      2004.

As
      a
      result of the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events, PT Freeport
      Indonesia notified its copper concentrate customers that it was declaring force
      majeure under the terms of its contracts as it would be unable to satisfy its
      annual sales and delivery commitments. In December 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia
      terminated the force majeure that had been in effect since December 2003 under
      its concentrate sales contracts.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia maintains property damage and business interruption insurance
      related to its operations. In December 2004, we entered into an insurance
      settlement agreement and settled all claims that arose from the fourth-quarter
      2003 slippage and debris flow events in the Grasberg open-pit mine. PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

insurers
      agreed to pay an aggregate of $125.0 million in connection with its claims.
      After considering our joint venture partner

’s

interest
      in the proceeds, PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

share of
      proceeds totaled $95.0 million.

Exploration

As
      a
      result of our joint venture arrangements, Rio Tinto generally pays for 40
      percent of our joint venture exploration and exploratory drilling costs in
      Papua. The joint ventures incurred total exploration costs of $13.3 million
      in
      2005 and $13.6 million in 2004. The joint ventures’ exploration budget for 2006,
      including Rio Tinto’s share, is expected to total approximately $15 million ($10
      million for our share) with most of the effort focused on potential extensions
      of the Grasberg underground and Kucing Liar mine complex, and testing downward
      extensions of the previously mined Ertsberg deposit. We continue to assess
      the
      timing of resumption of suspended exploration activities in areas outside the
      existing producing area of the Grasberg minerals district.

In
      June
      1998, we entered into a joint venture agreement to conduct exploration
      activities in PT Nabire Bakti Mining

’s

Contract
      of Work area, which currently covers approximately 500,000 acres in several
      blocks contiguous to PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

Block B
      and one of Eastern Minerals’ blocks in Papua. Rio Tinto shares in 40 percent of
      our interest and costs in this exploration joint venture. We and Rio Tinto
      can
      earn up to a 62 percent interest in the PT Nabire Bakti Mining Contract of
      Work
      by spending up to $21 million on exploration and other activities in the joint
      venture areas. We have spent $17.3 million through December 31,
      2005.

With
      the
      subsequent approval of the Indonesian government, in 2000 we suspended our
      field
      exploration activities in Block B, which includes the Wabu Ridge gold prospect,
      as well as in the other Contract of Work areas of Eastern Minerals and PT Nabire
      Bakti Mining. The suspensions are due to safety and security issues and
      regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and
      exploration rights in certain forest areas and an Indonesian Forestry law
      enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining in forest preservation areas. All
      of
      the


Table
      of Contents

suspended
      areas are outside of our current mining operations area. We continue to assess
      the possible timing for resumption of our exploration activities.

Infrastructure

The
      location of our mining operations in a remote area requires that our operations
      be virtually self-sufficient. In addition to the mining facilities described
      above, in the course of the development of our project we have constructed
      ourselves or participated with others in the construction of an airport, a
      port,
      a 119 kilometer road, an aerial tramway, two hospitals and related medical
      facilities, and two town sites with housing, schools and other facilities
      sufficient to support more than 17,000 persons.

In
      1996,
      we completed a significant infrastructure program, which includes various
      residential, community and commercial facilities. We designed the program to
      provide the infrastructure needed for our operations, to enhance the living
      conditions of our employees, and to develop and promote the growth of local
      and
      other third party activities and enterprises in Papua. We have developed the
      facilities through joint ventures or direct ownership involving local Indonesian
      interests and other investors.

In
      July
      2003, we acquired the 85.7 percent ownership interest in Puncakjaya Power owned
      by affiliates of Duke Energy Corporation for $68.1 million cash, net of $9.9
      million of cash acquired. Puncakjaya Power is the owner of assets supplying
      power to PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations, including the 3x65 megawatt
      coal-fired power facilities. PT Freeport Indonesia purchases power from
      Puncakjaya Power under infrastructure asset financing arrangements. In March
      2005, we prepaid $187.0 million of bank debt associated with Puncakjaya Power’s
      operations; and as a result of this prepayment of debt, at December 31, 2005,
      we
      had a $135.4 million intercompany loan outstanding to Puncakjaya Power. At
      December 31, 2005, PT Freeport Indonesia had infrastructure asset financing
      obligations to Puncakjaya Power totaling $218.1 million and Puncakjaya Power
      had
      a receivable from PT Freeport Indonesia for $280.0 million, including Rio
      Tinto’s share. We consolidate PT Freeport Indonesia and Puncakjaya Power and our
      consolidated balance sheet only reflects a $61.9 million receivable ($8.8
      million in other accounts receivable and $53.1 million in long-term assets)
      for
      Rio Tinto’s share of Puncakjaya Power’s receivable as provided for in our joint
      venture agreement with Rio Tinto.

Marketing

PT
      Freeport Indonesia sells its copper concentrates, which contain significant
      quantities of gold and silver, under U.S. dollar-denominated sales agreements,
      mostly to companies in Asia and Europe and to international trading companies.
      We sell substantially all of our budgeted production of copper concentrates
      under long-term contracts with selling prices based on world metals prices
      (generally the London Metal Exchange settlement prices for Grade A copper).
      Under these contracts, initial billing occurs at the time of shipment and final
      settlement on the copper portion is generally based on average prices for a
      specified future period. Gold generally is sold at the average London Bullion
      Market Association price for a specified month near the month of
      shipment.

Revenues
      from concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties (see “Contracts of Work”),
      treatment and refining charges (including participation charges, if applicable,
      based on the market prices of metals), and the impact of derivative financial
      instruments, if any, used to hedge against risks from metals price fluctuations.
      Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates
      is
      unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, our revenues from concentrate
      sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of
      these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of our
      contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent
      payments to smelters and refiners and are either fixed or in certain cases
      vary
      with the price of copper. We sell a small amount of copper concentrates in
      the
      spot market. See “Risk Factors.”

We
      have
      commitments, including commitments from Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting, for
      essentially all of PT Freeport Indonesia’s estimated 2006 production. PT
      Freeport Indonesia has a long-term contract through 2007 to provide Atlantic
      Copper with a quantity of copper concentrates at market prices which currently
      approximates 60 percent of Atlantic Copper

’s

annual
      copper concentrate requirements. PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

agreement with PT Smelting provides, for the life of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

mines,
      for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary
      to produce 205,000 metric tons of copper (essentially the Gresik
      smelter

’s

original
      design capacity) on a priority basis. In 2004, PT Smelting increased its stated
      production capacity to 250,000 metric tons of copper per year. PT Smelting
      plans
      to expand its production capacity to approximately 270,000 metric tons of copper
      metal per year by the middle of 2006. For the first 15 years of PT
      Smelting

’s

commercial operations beginning December 1998, PT Freeport Indonesia agreed
      that
      the treatment and refining


Table
      of Contents

charges
      on specified quantities of the concentrate PT Freeport Indonesia supplies will
      not fall below specified minimum rates, subject to renegotiation in 2008. The
      rate was $0.23 per pound, during the period from the commencement of PT
      Smelting

’s

operations in 1998 until April 3, 2004 when it declined to a minimum of $0.21
      per pound. We anticipate that PT Freeport Indonesia will sell approximately
      to 60 percent of its annual concentrate production to Atlantic Copper and PT
      Smelting. A summary of PT Freeport Indonesia

Investment
      in Smelters

Our
      investment in smelters (Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting) serves an important
      role in our concentrate marketing strategy. As discussed above, PT Freeport
      Indonesia generally sells approximately one-half of its concentrate production
      to its affiliated smelters, Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting, and the remainder
      to other customers. Treatment charges for smelting and refining copper
      concentrates represent a cost to PT Freeport Indonesia and income to Atlantic
      Copper and PT Smelting. Through downstream integration, we are assured placement
      of a significant portion of our concentrate production. While low smelting
      and
      refining charges in recent years adversely affected the operating results of
      Atlantic Copper, they benefited the operating results of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

mining
      operations, effectively achieving a hedge for these charges. Market rates for
      treatment and refining charges have increased significantly since late 2004.
      Higher treatment and refining charges benefit the operating results of Atlantic
      Copper and adversely affect the operating results of PT Freeport Indonesia.
      However, the net effect of changes in treatment and refining rates on our
      consolidated results is not material.

Atlantic
      Copper, S.A.

We own
      100 percent of Atlantic Copper. Atlantic Copper completed the last expansion
      of
      its production capacity in 1997 and its smelter currently has a
      nominal capacity of 290,000 metric tons of copper per year and its refinery
      currently has a design capacity of 260,000 metric tons of copper per year.
      We
      have no present plans to expand Atlantic Copper

’s

production capacity. During 2005, Atlantic Copper treated 975,400 metric tons
      of
      concentrate and scrap and produced 284,200 metric tons of new copper anodes.
      During 2004, Atlantic Copper treated 768,100 metric tons of concentrate and
      scrap and produced 224,300 metric tons of new copper anodes. Atlantic Copper’s
      positive results in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily reflect higher treatment
      charge rates and realized benefits from a recent cost reduction and operational
      enhancement effort, partially offset by higher energy costs. Atlantic Copper
      completed a 51-day scheduled major maintenance turnaround in May 2004, adversely
      affecting 2004 results. Major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically
      occur approximately every nine years for Atlantic Copper, with significantly
      shorter-term maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim. Atlantic Copper
      has a 22-day maintenance turnaround currently scheduled for 2007. Atlantic
      Copper purchased approximately 55 percent of its 2005 concentrate requirements
      from PT Freeport Indonesia at market prices. Atlantic Copper has experienced
      no
      material operating problems, and we are not aware of any potential material
      environmental liabilities at Atlantic Copper.

We
      made
      no capital contributions to Atlantic Copper in 2005; however, we contributed
      $202.0 million to Atlantic Copper in 2004 and $10.0 million in 2003. In
      addition, we loaned $189.5 million to Atlantic Copper in 2004. The funds were
      used to improve Atlantic Copper

’s

financial structure during its major maintenance turnaround and during a period
      of extremely low treatment and refining charge rates, which negatively affected
      Atlantic Copper

’s

results.
      Our net investment in Atlantic Copper through December 31, 2005, was $115.0
      million.

PT
      Smelting.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

Contract
      of Work required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in
      Indonesia if we and the Indonesian government determined that such a project
      would be economically viable. In 1995, following the completion of a feasibility
      study, we entered into agreements relating to the formation of PT Smelting
      and
      the construction of the copper smelter in Gresik, Indonesia.

PT
      Smelting is a joint venture among PT Freeport Indonesia, Mitsubishi Materials
      Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Mining & Metals Co., Ltd.,
      which own 25 percent, 60.5 percent, 9.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively,
      of
      the outstanding PT Smelting common stock. In accordance with the joint venture
      agreements, PT Freeport Indonesia provides the majority of PT
      Smelting

’s

copper
      concentrate requirements. In December 2003, PT Smelting

’s

shareholder agreement was amended to eliminate PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

assignment of its earnings in


Table
      of Contents

PT
      Smelting to support a 13 percent cumulative annual return to the other owners
      for the first 20 years of operations. No amounts were paid under this
      assignment. PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

total
      investment in PT Smelting through December 31, 2005, was $98.7
      million.

During
      2005, PT Smelting treated 908,900 metric tons of concentrate and produced
      275,000 metric tons of new copper anodes. During 2004, PT Smelting treated
      758,100 metric tons of concentrate and produced 211,600 metric tons of new
      copper anodes. PT Smelting completed a 31-day major maintenance turnaround
      in
      the second quarter of 2004. Major maintenance turnarounds of this duration
      typically occur approximately every four years for PT Smelting, with
      significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. PT Smelting
      has an 18-day maintenance turnaround scheduled for mid-2006 and its next major
      maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2008. PT Smelting also completed a
      refinery expansion during the maintenance turnaround, increasing its production
      capacity to approximately 250,000 metric tons of copper metal per year. PT
      Smelting plans to further expand its production capacity to approximately
      270,000 metric tons of copper metal per year by the middle of 2006. PT Smelting
      has experienced no material operating problems and we are not aware of any
      potential material environmental liabilities at PT Smelting.

Competition

We
      compete with other mining companies in the sale of our mineral concentrates
      and
      the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel. Some competing companies
      possess financial resources greater than ours and possess multiple mining assets
      less geographically concentrated in a single area than ours. We believe,
      however, that we are one of the lowest-cost copper producers in the world,
      after
      taking into account credits for related gold and silver production, which gives
      us a significant competitive advantage.

Social
      Development, Employment and Human Rights

We
      have a
      social, employment and human rights policy designed to result in our operating
      in compliance with the laws in the areas of our operations, and in a manner
      that
      respects basic human rights and the culture of the people who are indigenous
      to
      the area. We continue to make significant expenditures on social and cultural
      activities, primarily in Papua. These activities include:

·

comprehensive
                job training programs;

·

basic
                education programs;

·

several
                public health programs, including extensive malaria
                control;

·

agricultural
                assistance programs;

·

a
                business incubator program to encourage the local people to establish
                their own small scale businesses;

·

cultural
                preservation programs; and

·

charitable
                donations.

In
      1996,
      PT Freeport Indonesia agreed to commit at least one percent of its revenues
      to
      the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development (formerly the Freeport
      Fund for Irian Jaya Development) to support village-based health, education,
      economic and social development programs in its area of operations. This
      commitment replaced our community development programs in which we spent a
      similar amount of money each year. Our share of contributions to the Freeport
      Partnership Fund for Community Development totaled $35.7 million in 2005, $17.5
      million in 2004 and $17.4 million in 2003.  Our joint venture partner, Rio
      Tinto, also contributes to this fund and including their share the contributions
      totaled $42.3 million in 2005, $19.0 million in 2004 and $21.5 million in
      2003.

Lembaga
      Pembangunan Masyarakat Amungme Kamoro (LPMAK) oversees disbursement of the
      amounts we contribute to the fund. LPMAK

’s

board of
      commissioners is made up of a leader of the Amungme people, a leader of the
      Kamoro people, leaders of the three local churches, a representative of the
      local government and a representative of PT Freeport Indonesia.

We
      believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to
      the
      issues raised by the local villages and people and should help us to avoid
      disruptions of mining operations. Nevertheless, social and political instability
      in the area may adversely impact our mining operations. See “Risk
      Factors.”

In
      December 2000, we endorsed the joint U.S. State Department-British Foreign
      Office Voluntary Principles on Human Rights and Security. Several major natural
      resources companies and international human rights


Table
      of Contents

organizations participated
      in developing the Voluntary Principles and have endorsed them. We participated
      in developing these principles and incorporated them into our social
      and human rights policy.

Security
      Matters

Consistent
      with our Contract of Work and the requirement to protect our employees
      and property, we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure
      working environment. As part of its security program, PT Freeport Indonesia
      maintains its own internal security department, which performs functions such
      as
      protecting company facilities, monitoring the shipment of company goods through
      the airport and terminal, assisting in traffic control and aiding rescue
      operations. PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

civilian
      security employees (numbering about 680) are unarmed and perform duties
      consistent with their internal security role. PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

share of
      costs for its internal civilian security department totaled $11.3 million for
      2005, $12.3 million for 2004 and $11.2 million for 2003. The security department
      has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his
      or
      her compliance with our human rights policy.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia, and all businesses and residents of Indonesia, relies on
      the
      Government of Indonesia for the provision of public order, upholding the rule
      of
      law and the protection of personnel and property. The Grasberg mine has been
      designated by the Government of Indonesia as one of Indonesia

’s

vital
      national assets. This designation results in the military

’s

playing
      a significant role in protecting the area of our operations. The Government
      of
      Indonesia is responsible for employing police and military personnel and
      directing their operations.

From
      the
      outset of PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

operations, the government has looked to PT Freeport Indonesia to provide
      logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary
      services because of the limited resources of the Indonesian government and
      the
      remote location of and lack of development in Papua. PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

financial support for the Indonesian government security institutions assigned
      to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to
      protect its workforce and property, better ensuring that personnel are properly
      fed and lodged, and have the logistical resources to patrol PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

roads
      and secure its operating area. In addition, provision of such support and
      oversight is consistent with PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

obligations under the Contract of Work, reflects our philosophy of responsible
      corporate citizenship, and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices
      that will promote human rights, which include our endorsement of the joint
      U.S.
      State Department-British Foreign Office Voluntary Principles on Human Rights
      and
      Security.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

share of
      support costs for the government-provided security, involving over 2,400
      Indonesian government security personnel currently located in the general area
      of our operations, was $6.2 million for 2005, $6.9 million for 2004 and $5.9
      million for 2003. This supplemental support consists of various infrastructure
      and other costs, such as food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs,
      allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs, and community
      assistance programs conducted by the military/police. PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

capital
      costs for associated infrastructure was $0.1 million for 2005, $0.2 million
      for
      2004 and $0.6 million for 2003.

As
      reported in January 2006, we are responding to requests from governmental
      authorities in the United States and Indonesia for information about PT
      Freeport Indonesia primarily relating to PT Freeport Indonesia's support of
      Indonesian security institutions. As discussed above, we provide support to
      assist security institutions deployed and directed by the Government of
      Indonesia with infrastructure, logistics and the hardship elements of posting
      in
      Papua and our practices adhere to the joint U.S. State Department-British
      Foreign Office Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. 
We intend to cooperate in responding to these
      requests.

Environmental
      Matters

We
      have a
      board-approved environmental policy that commits us not only to compliance
      with
      applicable federal, state and local environmental statutes and regulations,
      but
      also to continuous improvement of our environmental performance at every
      operational site. We believe that we conduct our Indonesian operations pursuant
      to all necessary permits and are in compliance in all material respects with
      applicable Indonesian environmental laws, rules and regulations. Additionally,
      the environmental management systems for our PT Freeport Indonesia mining and
      milling operations and our Atlantic Copper smelting operations are ISO
      (International Standardization Organization) 14001 certified.

Mining
      operations on the scale of our operations in Papua involve significant
      environmental challenges, primarily related to the disposition of tailings,
      which are the crushed and ground rock material resulting from the physical
      separation of commercially valuable minerals from the ore. We have
      comprehensive, ongoing environmental


Table
      of Contents

management
      and monitoring plans for the disposal of tailings resulting from our milling
      operations, which the Government of Indonesia has approved. Pursuant to these
      plans, we manage and monitor the impact of our tailings disposal on the
      surrounding area of the Ajkwa River and adjoining water bodies and the
      surrounding coastal areas. In 1997, we completed an engineered levee system
      to
      minimize the impact of the tailings through a controlled deposition area located
      on a portion of the flood plain on the Ajkwa River.

In
      furtherance of our commitments to the Indonesian government pursuant to our
      tailings management plan, we monitor the acid-neutralizing capacity of tailings
      on a daily basis to ensure the discharge of non-acid generating tailings into
      our tailings deposition area. The net acid-neutralizing capacity of our tailings
      discharge is maintained through a managed program of blending underground ore
      with ore from the open pit, the addition of supplemental limestone (or lime)
      to
      the ore blend, and the addition of lime for control of the pH levels in the
      flotation system. Daily samples are collected and tested and this data is
      communicated to our mill operations so that adjustments in ore blending and
      lime/limestone addition can be made as appropriate.

With
      respect to overburden, control and treatment of acid rock drainage is our
      primary environmental issue. Our approaches to this issue include the prevention
      of acid rock drainage generation, the control of acid rock drainage migration,
      and the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage emanating from the
      overburden stockpile. In addition, tests have shown the feasibility of
      revegetating the overburden stockpile and, as a result, we have engaged in
      stockpile reclamation as an additional means of mitigating acid rock
      drainage.

We
      have
      made significant capital expenditures with respect to the capture and treatment
      of acid rock drainage. We continue to evaluate various technologies for the
      treatment of captured acid rock drainage. Currently, acid rock drainage
      collected by boreholes at the base of the overburden stockpile is treated using
      conventional lime neutralization.

We
      have
      also committed to the Indonesian government to have independent external
      environmental audits of our Papuan operations performed by qualified experts
      every three years, with results available for public review. We have had four
      independent environmental audits conducted by internationally recognized
      consulting and auditing firms. Montgomery Watson Harza has completed the
      fieldwork for the 2005 external environmental audit and we expect the audit
      report to be completed by early in the second quarter of 2006.
      We conduct annual internal audits to  ensure that our environmental
      management and monitoring programs remain sound and our
      operations will continue to comply in all material respects with
      applicable regulations.

In
      connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the Indonesian
      government, we committed to performing a one-time environmental risk assessment
      on the impacts of our tailings management plan. We completed this extensive
      environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted
      over four years and submitted it to the Indonesian government in December 2002.
      We developed the risk assessment exercise with input from an independent review
      panel, which included representatives from the Indonesian government, academia,
      and non-governmental organizations. The risks that we identified during this
      process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management
      program contained in our environmental approval documents.

We
      have
      environmental approvals from the Government of Indonesia to expand our milling
      rate up to a maximum of 300,000 metric tons of ore per day. In 2005, we averaged
      216,200 metric tons of ore per day and in 2004 we averaged 185,100 metric tons
      of ore per day.

The
      cost
      of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental cost of our business.
      We
      incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental
      costs totaling $44.0 million in 2005, $65.1 million in 2004 and $72.1 million
      in
      2003, including tailings management levee maintenance and mine reclamation.
      In
      2006, we expect to incur approximately $28 million of aggregate environmental
      capital expenditures and $37 million of other environmental
      costs.

We
      are
      currently revegetating portions of the tailings deposition area. Upon the
      completion of our mining operations, we will fulfill
      the commitments included in our approved
      environmental management plans. Our plans for revegetation of affected
      areas of the deposition area include natural revegetation, forage crops and
      grasses, fruits, grains and vegetables, and other traditional food and medicinal
      crops. Decisions on these plans are made in consultation with local and
      regional government, local residents and other stakeholders. In addition to
      the
      revegetation and reclamation of the deposition area, we will continue to operate
      treatment systems as long as necessary. We also monitor and test the water
      discharged from our mine and the pH, sulfate and electrical conductivity levels
      of ground water in the deposition area. The stability of our levees will be
      ensured through


Table
      of Contents

comprehensive
      visual inspection, maintenance and improvement programs directed by an
      experienced engineering group dedicated to levee management and revegetation
      of
      the levee embankments. Moreover, we will submit an annual written report to
      the
      Indonesian government regarding our reclamation activities.

Our
      ultimate reclamation and closure activities will be determined after
      consultation with the Indonesian government, local residents and other parties.
      Our estimate as of December 31, 2005 of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

total
      aggregate reclamation and closure obligations total approximately $156 million.
      Estimates of reclamation and closure costs involve complex issues requiring
      integrated assessments over a period of many years, and we may revise them
      as we
      perform more complete studies. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during
      mining activities, while most closure costs and the remaining reclamation costs
      will be incurred at the end of mining activities, which are currently estimated
      to continue for more than 35 years.

Moreover,
      we cannot predict with any certainty the ultimate future uses of the tailings
      deposition area once our mining operations are completed. In addition to forage
      crop and grass planting and food and medicinal crop production, possible future
      uses of the tailings deposition area include rainforest regrowth, production
      of
      timber, fuel woods, fruits and nuts and other economic forestry, and the
      cultivation of fish, shellfish and other aquaculture. The ultimate future uses
      will be determined in consultation with local and regional government, local
      residents and other stakeholders.

In
      1996,
      we began contributing to a cash fund ($7.2 million balance at December 31,
      2005)
      designed to accumulate at least $100 million by the end of our Indonesian mining
      activities. We plan to use this fund, including accrued interest, to pay for
      mine closure and reclamation costs. Any incremental costs in excess of this
      $100
      million fund are expected to be incurred throughout the life of the mine and
      would be funded by operational cash flow or other sources. Future
      environmental considerations and future changes in regulations could
      require us to incur additional costs that would be charged against future
      operations. Estimates involving environmental matters are by their nature
      imprecise and changes in government regulations, operations, technology and
      inflation can be expected to require us to revise them over
      time.

We
      believe that Atlantic Copper

’s

facilities and operations are in compliance in all material respects with all
      currently applicable Spanish environmental laws, rules and regulations. In
      July 2002, the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control guidelines were
      adopted under Spanish law with a phase in for compliance by 2009. Atlantic
      Copper, working with local environmental authorities, is continually assessing
      the impact of these new guidelines on its operations, and has budgeted
      approximately $20 million as its estimate of the remaining required capital
      expenditures from 2006 through 2009 to comply. In April 2005, the Environmental
      Management Systems at Atlantic Copper’s operations in Huelva were audited by the
      Spanish Association for Standardization and Certification (AENOR), in accordance
      with the ISO 14001:96 international certification standards and the European
      Union Environmental, Eco-Management and Eco-Auditing (EMAS) Regulation No.
      761/2001. AENOR is a Spanish not-for-profit entity that has been accredited
      by
      the Spanish government to inspect, audit and certify environmental management
      systems. Atlantic Copper received positive results from the audits, which are
      required annually to retain the ISO 14001 certification that Atlantic Copper
      achieved in prior years.

The
      Indonesian and Spanish governments may periodically revise their environmental
      laws and regulations or adopt new ones, and we cannot predict the effects on
      our
      operations of new or revised regulations. We have expended significant
      resources, both financial and managerial, to comply with environmental
      regulations and permitting and approval requirements, and we anticipate that
      we
      will continue to do so in the future. There can be no assurance that we will
      not
      incur additional significant costs and liabilities to comply with such current
      and future regulations or that such regulations will not materially affect
      our
      operations (see “Risk Factors”).

Employees
      and Relationship with FM Services Company

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, PT Freeport Indonesia had 8,044 employees (approximately
      percent Indonesian) and 6,225 contract workers, the vast majority of whom were
      Indonesian. Approximately 75 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

employees are represented by the All Indonesia Workers’ Union, which operates
      under Government of Indonesia supervision. PT Freeport Indonesia has a labor
      agreement covering its hourly paid Indonesian employees, the key provisions
      of
      which are renegotiated biannually. In June 2005, PT Freeport Indonesia and
      its
      workers agreed to terms for a new labor agreement that expires in September
      2007. PT Freeport Indonesia’s relations with the workers’ union have generally
      been satisfactory. In addition, 4,475 persons worked for privatized companies
      providing services within PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

operations area.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, Atlantic Copper had 544 employees, of which approximately
      percent are represented by union contracts. Atlantic Copper’s labor contract
      covering its smelter/refinery workforce in Huelva, Spain expired on December
      31,
      2005 and was renewed for a three-year period with no material changes in terms.
      Atlantic Copper experienced a four-day labor strike in October 2004 at its
      smelter facility in Huelva because of a workforce reduction plan. The union’s
      issues with the workforce reduction plan were resolved and the plan was approved
      by Spanish authorities and implemented in December 2004.

FM
      Services Company (FM Services) furnishes executive, administrative, financial,
      accounting, legal, tax and similar services to us. FM Services became our wholly
      owned subsidiary in October 2002, when we purchased the remaining 50 percent
      ownership in FM Services from McMoRan Exploration Co. (McMoRan) for $1.3
      million. As of December 31, 2005, FCX had 10 employees and FM Services had
      employees. FM Services employees continue to also provide services to McMoRan,
      a
      publicly traded company engaged in the exploration, development and production
      of oil and gas, and Stratus Properties Inc., a publicly traded company engaged
      in the development of real estate.

Item
      1A. Risk Factors

This
      report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal
      securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than
      statements of historical facts, such as statements regarding anticipated
      production volumes, unit net cash costs, sales volumes, ore grades, commodity
      prices, development and capital expenditures, mine production and development
      plans, environmental reclamation and closure cost and plans, reserve estimates,
      political, economic and social conditions in our areas of operations, and
      exploration efforts and results. Except for our ongoing obligations under the
      federal securities laws, we do not intend, and we undertake no obligation,
      to
      update or revise any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that
      forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual
      results may differ materially from those projected, anticipated or assumed
      in
      the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual
      results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking
      statements include the following:

Because
      our primary operating assets are located in the Republic of Indonesia, our
      business may be adversely affected by Indonesian political, economic and social
      uncertainties, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting
      business in a foreign country.

Indonesia
      has faced political, economic and social uncertainties, including separatist
      movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. In
      particular, several separatist groups are opposing Indonesian rule over the
      province of Papua, where our mining operations are located, and have sought
      political independence for the province. In response to demands for political
      independence, new Indonesian regional autonomy laws became effective January
      1,
      2001. However, the manner in which the new laws are being implemented and the
      degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual
      provinces, including Papua, is uncertain and is an ongoing issue in Indonesian
      politics. Moreover, in Papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians
      by
      separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists
      and
      the Indonesian military. Social, economic and political instability in Papua
      could materially and adversely affect us if this instability results in damage
      to our property or interruption of our activities.

Maintaining
      a good working relationship with the Indonesian government is important to
      us
      because all of our mining operations are located in Indonesia and are conducted
      pursuant to Contracts of Work with the Indonesian government. Accordingly,
      we
      are also subject to the usual risks associated with conducting business in
      and
      with a foreign country, including the risk of forced modification of existing
      contracts, changes in the country

’s

laws and
      policies, including those relating to taxation, royalties, divestment, imports,
      exports and currency, and the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction
      of a
      foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a
      foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own
      territory. In addition, we are subject to the risk of expropriation, and our
      insurance does not cover losses caused by expropriation.

In
      February 2006, a group of illegal gold panners engaged in conflict with
      Indonesian police and PT Freeport Indonesia security personnel when they were
      requested to leave an area near our milling facilities. Following the incident,
      the illegal panners blocked the road leading to the Grasberg mine and mill
      in
      protest and we temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a
      precautionary measure. The panners also vandalized some of our light vehicles
      and offices near this area, causing approximately $4 million in damages. Our
      port facilities continued to operate during the disruption and concentrate
      shipments were not affected. The panners, mostly Papuans from outside our area
      of operations, presented a list of aspirations, primarily relating to their
      desire to share in the benefits


Table
      of Contents

of
      our
      existing initiatives and programs provided for the Papuans who are the
      traditional residents of our operations area. Mining and milling operations
      resumed after an approximate four-day outage. During the incident at our mine
      and mill, protestors in Jakarta vandalized the entrance floor of the office
      building housing our Indonesian headquarters and staged a three-day rally
      outside the building. The Indonesian police handled this matter, which did
      not
      disrupt our administrative functions or damage any of our
      facilities.

We
        cannot
        predict if there will be additional incidents similar to the February 2006
        protests. If there were additional protests at our mine and mill facilities,
        it
        could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability in ways
        that we cannot predict at this time.

In
      addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, we face
      additional risks because our operations are located on difficult terrain in
      a
      very remote area.

Our
      mining operations are located in steeply mountainous terrain in a very remote
      area in Indonesia. Because of these conditions, we have had to overcome special
      engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. In
      addition, the area receives considerable rainfall, which has led to periodic
      floods and mudslides. The mine site is also in an active seismic area and has
      experienced earth tremors from time to time. In addition to these special risks,
      we are also subject to the usual risks associated with the mining industry,
      such
      as the risk of encountering unexpected geological conditions that may result
      in
      cave-ins and flooding of mine areas. Our insurance may not sufficiently cover
      an
      unexpected natural or operating disaster.

On
      October 9, 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a section of the Grasberg
      open pit, resulting in eight fatalities. On December 12, 2003, a debris flow
      involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same
      section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage. All material
      involved in the affected mining areas was removed. The events caused us to
      alter
      our short-term mine sequencing plans, which adversely affected our 2003 and
      production. While we resumed normal production activities in the second quarter
      of 2004, no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the
      future.

The
      terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, subsequent attacks
      in Indonesia and the potential for additional future terrorist acts and other
      recent events have created economic and political uncertainties that could
      materially and adversely affect our business and the prices of our
      securities.

On
      August
      31, 2002, three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush
      by a
      group of unidentified assailants. The assailants shot at several vehicles
      transporting international contract teachers from our school in Tembagapura,
      their family members, and other contractors to PT Freeport Indonesia on the
      road
      near Tembagapura, the mining town where the majority of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

personnel reside. We, along with the U.S. government, the central Indonesian
      government, the Papuan provincial and local governments, and leaders of the
      local people residing in the area of our operations condemned the attack.
      Indonesian authorities and the U.S. FBI investigated the incident, which
      resulted in the U.S. indictment of an alleged operational commander of the
      Free
      Papua Movement/National Freedom Force. In January 2006, Indonesian Police,
      accompanied by FBI agents, arrested the alleged operational commander in the
      Free Papua Movement/National Freedom Force and 11 other Papuans.

On
      October 12, 2002, a bombing killed 202 people in the Indonesian province of
      Bali, which is 1,500 miles west of our mining and milling operations. Indonesian
      authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those
      arrested have been tried and convicted. On August 5, 2003, 12 people were killed
      and over 100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the JW
      Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. On September 9, 2004, 11 people were
      killed and over 200 others injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the
      Australian embassy in Jakarta. On October 1, 2005, three suicide bombers killed
      19 people and wounded over 100 others in Bali. The same international terrorist
      organizations are suspected in each of these incidents. In November 2005,
      Indonesian Police raided a house in East Java that resulted in the death of
      other accused terrorists linked to the bombings discussed above. Our mining
      and
      milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but our corporate
      office in Jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing
      in
      front of the Australian embassy.

We
      cannot
      predict whether there will be additional incidents similar to the recent
      shooting or bombings. If there were to be additional separatist, terrorist
      or
      other violence in Indonesia, it could materially and adversely affect our
      business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this
      time.

Terrorist
      attacks and other recent events have caused uncertainty in the world

’s

financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase global political,
      economic and social instability, including in Indonesia. In addition to the
      Bali, JW Marriott Hotel and Australian embassy bombings, there have been
      anti-American demonstrations in certain sections of Indonesia reportedly led
      by
      radical Islamic activists. Radical activists have also threatened to attack
      foreign interests and have called for the expulsion of U.S. and British citizens
      and companies from Indonesia.

It
      is
      possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the U.S.
      domestically or abroad, and such acts could be directed against properties
      and
      personnel of companies such as ours. The attacks and the resulting economic
      and
      political uncertainties, including the potential for further terrorist acts,
      have negatively impacted insurance markets. Moreover, while our property and
      business interruption insurance covers damages to insured property directly
      caused by terrorism, this insurance does not cover damages and losses caused
      by
      war. Terrorism and war developments may materially and adversely affect our
      business and profitability and the prices of our securities in ways that we
      cannot predict at this time.

Our
      profitability can vary significantly with fluctuations in the market prices
      of
      copper and gold.

Our
      revenues are derived primarily from the sale of copper concentrates, which
      also
      contain significant quantities of gold and silver, and from the sale of copper
      cathodes and anodes. Although we sell most of our copper concentrates under
      long-term contracts, the selling price is based on world metal prices at or
      near
      the time of shipment and delivery.

During
      2005, the daily closing prices on the London spot market ranged from $1.39
      to
      $2.11 per pound for copper and $411 to $538 per ounce for gold. During 2004,
      the
      daily closing prices on the London spot market ranged from $1.06 to $1.49 per
      pound for copper and $374 to $456 per ounce for gold.

World
      copper prices have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous
      factors beyond our control, including:

·

the
                strength of the U.S. economy and the economies of other industrialized
                and
                developing nations, including
                China;

·

available
                supplies of copper from mine production and
                inventories;

·

sales
                by holders and producers of copper;

·

demand
                for industrial products containing copper;
                and

·

investment
                activity, including speculation, in copper as a
                commodity.

World
      gold prices also have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by
      numerous factors beyond our control, including:

·

the
                strength of the U.S. economy and the economies of other industrialized
                and
                developing nations, including
                China;

·

global
                or regional political or economic
                crises;

·

the
                relative strength of the U.S. dollar and other
                currencies;

·

expectations
                with respect to the rate of
                inflation;

·

interest
                rates;

·

purchases
                and sales of gold by central banks and other
                holders;

·

demand
                for jewelry containing gold; and

·

investment
                activity, including speculation, in gold as a
                commodity.

Any
      material decrease in market prices of copper or gold would materially and
      adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See our
      Annual Report incorporated herein by reference for an analysis of the effect
      on
      our revenues and net income of changes in copper and gold prices.

Our
      Contracts of Work are subject to termination if we do not comply with our
      contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to
      the
      jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

Contracts of Work and other Contracts of Work in which we have an interest
      were
      entered into under Indonesia

’s

      Foreign Capital Investment Law, which provides guarantees of remittance rights
      and protection against nationalization. Our Contracts of Work can be terminated
      by the Government of Indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations,
      which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the
      satisfaction of certain mining, environmental, safety and health requirements.
      Indonesian government officials have periodically raised questions regarding
      our
      compliance with Indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms
      of
      the Contracts of Work. In order to address these questions, the Indonesian
      government formed a fact-finding team in 2000 that reviewed our compliance
      with
      all aspects of PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

Contract
      of Work. We cannot assure you that, if and when the Indonesian
      government

’s

report is released, the report will conclude that we are complying with all
      of the provisions of PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

Contract
      of Work.

Moreover, at
      times, certain government officials and others in Indonesia have questioned
      the
      validity of contracts entered into by the Government of Indonesia prior
      to May 1998 (

i.e.

,
      during
      the Suharto regime), including PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

Contract
      of Work, which was signed in December 1991. We cannot assure you that the
      validity of, or our compliance with the Contracts of Work will not be challenged
      for political or other reasons. PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

Contracts of Work and our other Contracts of Work require that disputes with
      the
      Indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration. Notwithstanding
      that provision, if a dispute arises under the Contracts of Work, we face the
      risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration
      panel, and if we prevail in such a dispute, we will face the additional risk
      of
      having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against
      Indonesia within its own territory.

Any
      suspension of required activities under our Contracts of Work requires the
      consent of the Indonesian government.

Our
      Contracts of Work permit us to suspend certain contractually required
      activities, including exploration, for a period of one year by making a written
      request to the Indonesian government. These requests are subject to the approval
      of the Indonesian government and are renewable annually. If we do not request
      a
      suspension or are denied a suspension, then we are required to continue our
      activities under the Contract of Work or potentially be declared in default.
      Moreover, if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other
      than force majeure and the Indonesian government has not approved such
      continuation, then the government would be entitled to declare a default under
      the Contract of Work.

We
      suspended our field exploration activities outside of Block A in recent years
      due to safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a
      possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest
      areas and an Indonesian Forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining
      in forest preservation areas. In 2001, we requested and received from the
      Government of Indonesia, formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under
      the Contracts of Work in all areas outside of Block A. Recent Indonesian
      legislation permits open-pit mining in PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

Block B
      area, subject to certain requirements. We continue to assess these requirements
      and security issues. The timing for the resumption of exploration activities
      in
      our Contract of Work areas outside of Block A depends on the resolution of
      these
      matters.

Our
      mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and
      future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts
      from our operations, could require us to incur increased
      costs.

Mining
      operations on the scale of our operations in Papua involve significant
      environmental risks and challenges. Our primary challenge is to dispose of
      the
      large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called tailings, that results
      from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and
      silver-bearing materials from the ore that we mine. Our tailings management
      plan
      uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to the lowlands
      where the tailings and natural sediments are deposited in a controlled area
      contained within a levee system


Table
      of Contents

that
      will
      be revegetated. We incurred aggregate costs relating to tailings management
      of
      $8.7 million in 2005, $11.8 million in 2004 and $8.3 million in
      2003.

Another
      major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that
      must be moved aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore. In the
      presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can
      cause acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals which,
      if
      not properly managed, can have a negative impact on the
      environment.

Certain
      Indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised issues with
      respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion
      that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river deposition system
      for
      tailings disposal. Because our mining operations are remotely located in steep
      mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would
      be
      costly, difficult to construct and maintain, more prone to catastrophic
      failure and involve environmental issues. An external panel of qualified
      experts, as directed in our 300K ANDAL (the Environmental Impact Assessment
      document submitted to the Indonesian government), conducted detailed reviews
      and
      analyses of a number of technical studies. They concluded that all significant
      impacts identified were in line with the 300K ANDAL predictions, and that the
      current system of riverine tailings management was appropriate considering
      all
      site-specific factors. For these reasons, we do not believe that a pipeline
      system is necessary or practical.

We
      anticipate that we will continue to spend significant financial and managerial
      resources on environmental compliance. In addition, changes in Indonesian
      environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations
      could require us to incur significant unanticipated costs.

The
      volume and grade of the reserves we recover and our rates of production may
      be
      more or less than we anticipate.

Our
      reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry
      practices and standards, but are estimates of the mineral deposits that can
      be recovered economically and legally based on currently available
      data. Our ore bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations,
      and estimates may change as new data become available. Because ore bodies do
      not
      contain uniform grades of minerals, our metal recovery rates will vary from
      time
      to time, which will result in variations in the volumes of minerals that we
      can
      sell from period to period. Some of our reserves may become unprofitable to
      develop if there are unfavorable long-term market price fluctuations in copper
      and gold, or if there are significant increases in our operating or capital
      costs. In addition, our exploration programs may not result in the discovery
      of
      additional mineral deposits that we can mine profitably.

We
      do not expect to mine all of our reserves before the initial term of our
      Contract of Work expires.

All
      of
      our current proven and probable reserves, including the Grasberg deposit, are
      located in Block A. The initial term of our Contract of Work covering these
      reserves expires at the end of 2021. We can extend this term for two successive
      10-year periods, subject to the approval of the Indonesian government, which
      under our Contract of Work cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. Our
      reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end
      of
      2041 (

i.e

.,
      through the expiration of the two 10-year extensions) and our current mine
      plan
      has been developed, and our operations are based on the assumption that we
      will
      receive the two 10-year extensions. As a result, we will not mine all of our
      reserves during the current term of our Contract of Work, and there can be
      no
      assurance that the Indonesian government will approve the extensions. Prior
      to
      the end of 2021, we expect to mine approximately 44 percent of aggregate proven
      and probable recoverable ore at December 31, 2005, representing approximately
      percent of PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

share of
      recoverable copper reserves and approximately 65 percent of its share of
      recoverable gold reserves.

Servicing
      our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate
      sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our
      control.

Our
      ability to make payments on and to refinance our maturing debt depends on our
      ability to generate sufficient cash flow. This ability, to a significant extent,
      is subject to commodity prices and general economic, financial, regulatory,
      political and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our
      ability to borrow funds in the future to service our debt will depend on meeting
      the financial covenants in our 10⅛% senior notes due 2010, our 6⅞% senior notes
      due 2014, our bank credit facilities and other debt agreements we may have
      in
      the future. Future borrowings may not be available to us under our bank credit
      facilities or from the capital markets in amounts sufficient to enable us to
      pay
      our obligations as they mature or to fund other liquidity needs. As a result,
      we
      may


Table
      of Contents

need
      to
      refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. Any inability
      to
      generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could
      materially and adversely affect our financial condition.

Covenants
      in our bank credit facilities impose restrictions on us.

Although
      we currently have no amounts outstanding under our bank credit facilities,
      our
      bank credit facilities:

·

restrict
                the repurchase of, and payment of dividends on, our common stock
                under
                certain circumstances;

·

limit,
                among other things, our ability to:

·

incur
      additional indebtedness;

·

make
      investments;

·

engage
      in
      transactions with affiliates;

·

create
      liens on our assets; and

·

require
                us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition
                tests.

Events
      beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business
      conditions, may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants, which could
      result in a default. If an event of default occurs, the banks could declare
      any
      amounts outstanding together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and
      payable. An event of default under our bank credit facilities may also give
      rise
      to an event of default under our other existing and future debt
      agreements.

Covenants
      in our 10⅛% senior notes due 2010 and 6⅞% senior notes due 2014 also impose
      restrictions on us.

Our
      10⅛%
      senior notes and our 6⅞% senior notes limit, among other things, our ability
      to:

·

pay
                dividends on our common stock and repurchase and redeem certain classes
                of
                our capital stock;

·

incur
                additional indebtedness;

·

make
                investments;

·

engage
                in transactions with affiliates;
                and

·

create
                liens on our assets.

Movements
      in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could negatively affect
      our
      operating results.

All
      of
      our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in U.S.
      dollars; however, some costs, and certain asset and liability accounts are
      denominated in Indonesian rupiah, Australian dollars or euros. As a result,
      we
      are generally less profitable when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to these
      foreign currencies.

The
      rupiah/U.S. dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 9,142 to 10,753
      rupiah per U.S. dollar during 2005, and on December 30, 2005, the closing
      exchange rate was 9,825 rupiah per U.S. dollar compared with 9,270 rupiah per
      U.S. dollar on December 31, 2004. During 2005, the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar
      daily closing exchange rate ranged from $0.72 to $0.80 per Australian dollar
      and
      the euro/U.S. dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from $1.16 to $1.36
      per
      euro. On December 30, 2005, the closing exchange rates were $0.73 per Australian
      dollar and $1.18 per euro, compared with the December 31, 2004 closing exchange
      rates of $0.78 per Australian dollar and $1.36 per euro.

From
      time
      to time, we have in the past and may in the future implement currency hedges
      intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
      However, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged
      foreign exchange payment requirements will continue to be subject to market
      fluctuations.


Table
      of Contents

In
      addition, our bank credit facilities are based on fluctuating interest rates.
      Accordingly, an increase in interest rates could adversely affect our results
      of
      operations and financial condition.

Because
      we are a holding company, our ability to pay our debts depends upon the ability
      of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends and to advance us funds. In addition,
      our ability to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets is
      generally subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’
creditors.

Because
      we conduct business primarily through PT Freeport Indonesia, our major
      subsidiary, and other subsidiaries, our ability to pay our debts depends upon
      the earnings and cash flow of PT Freeport Indonesia and our other subsidiaries
      and their ability to pay us dividends and to advance us funds. Contractual
      and
      legal restrictions applicable to our subsidiaries could also limit our ability
      to obtain cash from them. Our rights to participate in any distribution of
      our
      subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would
      generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors,
      including any trade creditors and preferred shareholders.

Common
      Share Dividends

In
      February 2003, the Board of Directors initiated a cash dividend for FCX’s common
      stock of $0.09 per share quarterly beginning May 1, 2003. In October 2003,
      the
      Board authorized an increase in the cash dividend to an annual rate of $0.80
      per
      share and increased the dividend again in October 2004 to an annual rate of
      $1.00 per share. In December 2004, the Board authorized a supplemental common
      stock dividend of $0.25 per share, and during 2005 the Board authorized three
      supplemental dividends of $0.50 per share paid on March 31, 2005, September
      30,
      2005 and December 30, 2005. In November 2005, the Board authorized an increase
      in our annual common stock dividend to $1.25 per share (from $1.00 per share)
      payable quarterly ($0.3125 per share) beginning with the

      common stock and purchases of common stock are subject to limitations under
      our
      10⅛% Senior Notes and 6⅞% Senior Notes and, in certain circumstances, our credit
      facility.

Issuer
      Purchases of Equity Securities

In
      October 2003, our Board of Directors approved a new open market share purchase
      program for up to 20 million shares, which replaced our previous program. The
      program does not have an expiration date. No shares were purchased during the
      three-month period ended December 31, 2005, and 14.2 million shares remain
      available for purchase.

      income from continuing operations before minority interests in consolidated
      subsidiaries, income or loss from equity investees and fixed charges. Fixed
      charges include interest and that portion of rent deemed representative of
      interest. For the ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock
      dividends calculation, we assumed that our preferred stock dividend requirements
      were equal to the pre-tax earnings that would be required to cover those
      dividend requirements. We computed those pre-tax earnings using actual tax
      rates
      for each year.

Evaluation
      of disclosure controls and procedures

.
      Our
      chief executive officer and chief financial officer, with the participation
      of
      management, have evaluated the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and
      procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) under the Securities
      Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report
      on Form 10-K. Based on their evaluation, they have concluded that our disclosure
      controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material
      information relating to FCX (including our consolidated subsidiaries) required
      to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings.
