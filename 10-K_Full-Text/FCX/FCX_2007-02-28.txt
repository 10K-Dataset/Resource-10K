On
      November 19, 2006, FCX and Phelps Dodge Corporation announced that they had
      signed a definitive merger agreement whereby we will acquire Phelps Dodge for
      approximately $25.9 billion in cash and stock, based on FCX’s closing stock
      price on November 17, 2006, creating one of the largest publicly traded copper
      companies. The combined company will be a new industry leader with large,
      long-lived, geographically diverse assets and significant proven and probable
      reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. Completion of the transaction is
      subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of FCX and Phelps Dodge
      stockholder approval. On February 2, 2007, FCX and Phelps Dodge announced that
      each company will hold a special meeting of its stockholders on March 14, 2007,
      to vote on the proposed acquisition of Phelps Dodge by FCX. The transaction
      is
      expected to close in March 2007. The information contained in this Form 10-K

General

Through
      our majority-owned subsidiary, PT Freeport Indonesia, we have one of the world’s
      largest copper and gold mining and production operations in terms of reserves
      and production. Our principal asset is the Grasberg minerals district. We
      discovered the largest ore body in the district, Grasberg, in 1988. Based on
      available year-end 2005 data provided by third-party industry consultants,
      the
      Grasberg minerals district contains the largest single copper reserve and the
      largest single gold reserve of any mine in the world.

Our
      principal operating subsidiary is PT Freeport Indonesia, a limited liability
      company organized under the laws of the Republic of Indonesia and incorporated
      in Delaware. We own approximately 90.64 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia, and
      the Government of Indonesia owns the remaining approximate 9.36 percent. PT
      Freeport Indonesia mines, processes and explores for ore containing copper,
      gold
      and silver. It operates in the remote highlands of the Sudirman Mountain Range
      in the province of Papua, Indonesia, which is on the western half of the island
      of New Guinea. PT Freeport Indonesia markets its concentrates containing copper,
      gold and silver worldwide.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia conducts its operations pursuant to an agreement, called
      a
      Contract of Work, with the Government of Indonesia (see “Contracts of Work”).
      The Contract of Work allows us to conduct extensive mining, production and
      exploration activities in a 24,700-acre area that we call Block A, which
      contains the Grasberg minerals district, and governs our rights and obligations
      relating to taxes, exchange controls, royalties, repatriation and other matters.
      The Contract of Work also allows us to explore for minerals in an approximately
      500,000-acre area that we call Block B. Exploration activities in Block B have
      been suspended in recent years, but we expect to resume those activities in
      2007. The primary term of our Contract of Work expires in 2021 and we can extend
      it for two 10-year periods subject to Indonesian government approval, which
      cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably.

Another
      of our operating subsidiaries, PT Irja Eastern Minerals, which we refer to
      as
      Eastern Minerals, holds an additional Contract of Work in Papua covering
      approximately 1.2 million acres. Eastern Minerals conducts exploration
      activities, which had been suspended in recent years, under this Contract of
      Work (see “Contracts of Work”). In December 2006, Eastern Minerals received
      approval from the Government of Indonesia to resume exploration activities
      in
      2007. We have a 100 percent ownership interest in Eastern Minerals.

In
      1996,
      we established joint ventures with Rio Tinto plc, which is an international
      mining company with headquarters in London, England. Rio Tinto conducts mining
      operations in North America, South America, Asia, Australia, Europe and southern
      Africa. One of our joint ventures with Rio Tinto covers PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

mining
      operations in Block A. This joint venture gives Rio Tinto, through 2021, a
      percent interest in certain assets and in production above specified levels
      from
      operations in Block A and, after 2021, a 40 percent interest in all production
      in Block A. Under our joint venture arrangements, Rio Tinto also has a 40
      percent interest in PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

Contract
      of Work. In addition, Rio Tinto has the


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

option
      to
      participate in 40 percent of any of our other future exploration projects in
      Papua. To date, Rio Tinto has elected to participate in all exploration
      projects, including PT Nabire Bakti Mining.

Under
      a
      joint venture agreement through PT Nabire Bakti Mining, we conduct exploration
      activities, which have been suspended in recent years (see “Contracts of Work”),
      in an area covering approximately 500,000 acres in five parcels contiguous
      to PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

Block B
      and one of Eastern Minerals

blocks.
      We expect to resume exploration activities in PT Nabire Bakti Mining

’s

exploration area in 2007.

At
      December 31, 2006, PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of proven and probable
      recoverable reserves totaled 38.8 billion pounds of copper and 41.1 million
      ounces of gold, all of which are located in Block A. Our approximate 90.64
      percent equity share of these proven and probable recoverable reserves totaled
      35.2 billion pounds of copper and 37.2 million ounces of gold (see “Ore
      Reserves”). In this annual report, we refer to (1) aggregate reserves, which
      means all reserves for the operations we manage, (2) PT Freeport Indonesia’s
      share of reserves, which means the reserves net of Rio Tinto’s interest under
      our joint venture arrangements and which are the reserves reported as those
      of
      our operations in our consolidated financial statements and (3) our equity
      share
      of reserves, which is net of the 9.36 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia owned
      by
      the Government of Indonesia.

In
      July
      2003, we acquired the 85.7 percent ownership interest in PT Puncakjaya Power
      owned by affiliates of Duke Energy Corporation. Puncakjaya Power is the owner
      of
      assets supplying power to PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations, including the 3x65
      megawatt coal-fired power facilities (see “Infrastructure”).

We
      also
      smelt and refine copper concentrates in Spain and market the refined copper
      products through our wholly owned subsidiary, Atlantic Copper, S.A. In addition,
      PT Freeport Indonesia has a 25 percent interest in PT Smelting, an Indonesian
      company that operates a copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia. These
      smelters play an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy, as
      approximately one-half of PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

concentrate production has been sold to Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting over
      the
      last several years (see “Investment in Smelters”).

Contracts
      of Work

Through
      Contracts of Work with the Government of Indonesia, PT Freeport Indonesia and
      Eastern Minerals conduct their current exploration operations and PT Freeport
      Indonesia conducts its mining operations in Indonesia. Both Contracts of Work
      govern our rights and obligations relating to taxes, exchange controls,
      royalties, repatriation and other matters. Both Contracts of Work were concluded
      pursuant to the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which expresses
      Indonesia

’s

foreign
      investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and
      protection against nationalization, a framework for economic incentives and
      basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors.
      Specifically, the Contracts of Work provide that the Government of Indonesia
      will not nationalize or expropriate PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

or
      Eastern Minerals’ mining operations. Any disputes regarding the provisions of
      the Contracts of Work are subject to international arbitration. We have
      experienced no disputes requiring arbitration during the 39 years we have
      operated in Indonesia.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

Contract
      of Work covers both Block A, which was first included in a 1967 Contract of
      Work
      that was replaced by a new Contract of Work in 1991, and Block B, to which
      we
      gained rights in 1991. The initial term of our Contract of Work expires in
      December 2021, but we can extend it for two 10-year periods subject to
      Indonesian government approval, which cannot be withheld or delayed
      unreasonably. We originally had the rights to explore 6.5 million acres in
      Block
      B, but pursuant to the Contract of Work we have only retained the rights to
      approximately 500,000 acres, following significant geological
      assessment.

Eastern
      Minerals signed its Contract of Work in August 1994. The Contract of Work
      originally covered approximately 2.5 million acres. Eastern Minerals' Contract
      of Work provides for a four-to-seven year exploratory term and a 30-year term
      for mining operations. Subject to Indonesian government approval, which cannot
      be withheld or delayed unreasonably, we can extend this period for two 10-year
      periods. Eastern Minerals’ Contract of Work requires us to relinquish our rights
      to 25 percent of the original 2.5-million-acre Contract of Work area at the
      end
      of each of three specified periods. As of December 31, 2006, we had relinquished
      approximately 1.3 million acres and must relinquish an additional 0.6 million
      acres at the end of the three-year exploration period, which can be extended
      by
      the Government of Indonesia for as many as two additional years. The exploration
      activities under Eastern Minerals’ Contract of Work also had been suspended in
      recent years; however, in December 2006, Eastern Minerals received approval
      from
      the Government of Indonesia to resume exploration activities in
      2007.

We
      suspended our exploration activities outside of Block A in recent years because
      of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible
      conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas
      and
      an Indonesian Forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining in forest
      preservation areas. In 2001, we requested and received from the Government
      of
      Indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the Contracts
      of
      Work in all areas outside Block A. The current suspensions were granted for
      one-year periods ending February 26, 2007, for Block B and March 30, 2007,
      for
      PT Nabire Bakti Mining. Recent Indonesian legislation permits open-pit mining
      in
      PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

Block B
      area, subject to certain requirements. Following an assessment of these
      requirements and a review of security issues, we plan to resume exploration
      activities in certain prospective Contract of Work areas outside of Block A
      in
      2007.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia pays a copper royalty under its Contact of Work that varies
      from 1.5 percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of $0.90 or less per
      pound to 3.5 percent at a copper price of $1.10 or more per pound. The Contract
      of Work royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 1.0 percent.

A
      large
      part of the mineral royalties under Government of Indonesia regulations are
      designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted. In connection
      with our “fourth concentrator mill expansion,” PT Freeport Indonesia agreed to
      pay the Government of Indonesia additional royalties (royalties not required
      by
      our Contract of Work) to provide further support to the local governments and
      the people of Papua. PT Freeport Indonesia pays the additional royalties on
      production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper, gold and silver
      expected to be generated when its milling facilities operate above 200,000
      metric tons of ore per day. The additional royalty for copper equals the
      Contract of Work royalty rate and for gold and silver equals twice the Contract
      of Work royalty rates. Therefore, our royalty rate on copper net revenues from
      production above the agreed levels is double the Contract of Work royalty rate,
      and our royalty rates on gold and silver sales from production above the agreed
      levels are triple the Contract of Work royalty rates.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

share of
      the combined royalties, including the additional royalties which became
      effective January 1, 1999, totaled $126.0 million in 2006, $103.7 million in
      2005 and $43.5 million in 2004.



Republic
      of Indonesia

General.

The
      Republic of Indonesia consists of more than 17,000 islands stretching 3,000
      miles along the equator from Malaysia to Australia and is the fourth most
      populous nation in the world with over 245 million people. Following many years
      of Dutch colonial rule, Indonesia gained independence in 1945 and now has a
      presidential republic system of government.

Our
      mining complex was Indonesia

’s

first
      copper mining project and was the first major foreign investment in Indonesia
      following the economic development program instituted by the Indonesian
      government in 1967. We work closely with the central, provincial and local
      governments in development efforts in the area surrounding our operations.
      We
      have had positive relations with the Indonesian government since we commenced
      business activities in Indonesia in 1967, and we intend to continue to maintain
      positive working relationships with the central, provincial and local branches
      of the Indonesian government.

Political
      Developments.

In May
      1998, President Suharto, Indonesia

’s

political leader for more than 30 years, resigned in the wake of an economic
      crisis in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia and in the face of growing
      social unrest. Vice President B.J. Habibie succeeded Suharto. In June 1999,
      Indonesia held a new parliamentary election on a generally peaceful basis as
      the
      first step in the process of electing a new president. In October 1999, in
      accordance with the Indonesian constitution, the country

’s

highest
      political institution (the People

’s

Consultative Assembly), composed of the newly elected national parliament along
      with additional provincial and other representatives, elected Abdurrahman Wahid
      as president and Megawati Sukarnoputri as vice president.

In
      July
      2001, the People

’s

Consultative Assembly voted to remove President Wahid, and elected Vice
      President Megawati Sukarnoputri as president. In October 2004, Susilo Bambang
      Yudhoyono was elected as president in the nation’s first direct presidential
      election.

Other
      Developments.

In
      February 2006, a group of illegal gold panners engaged in conflict with
      Indonesian police and PT Freeport Indonesia security personnel when they were
      requested to leave an area near our milling facilities. Following the incident,
      the illegal panners blocked the road leading to the Grasberg mine and mill
      in
      protest and we temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a
      precautionary measure. The panners also vandalized some of our light vehicles
      and offices near this area, causing approximately $2 million in damages. Our
      port facilities continued to operate during the disruption and concentrate
      shipments were not affected. The panners, mostly Papuans from outside our area
      of operations, presented a list of aspirations, primarily relating to their
      desire to share in the benefits of our existing initiatives and programs
      provided for the Papuans who are the traditional residents of our operations
      area. Mining and milling operations resumed after an approximate four-day
      outage. During the incident at our mine and mill, protestors in Jakarta
      vandalized the entrance floor of the office building housing our Indonesian
      headquarters and staged a three-day rally outside the building. The Indonesian
      police handled this matter, which did not disrupt our administrative functions
      or damage any of our facilities.

On
      August
      31, 2002, three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush
      by a
      group of assailants. The assailants shot at several vehicles transporting
      international contract teachers from PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

school
      in Tembagapura, their family members, and other contractors to PT Freeport
      Indonesia on the road near Tembagapura, the mining town where the majority
      of PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

personnel reside. Indonesian authorities and the United States Federal Bureau
      of
      Investigation (FBI) investigated the incident, which resulted in the U.S.
      indictment of an alleged operational commander in the Free Papua
      Movement/National Freedom Force. In January 2006, Indonesian Police arrested
      this individual and 11 other Papuans. In November 2006, verdicts and sentencing
      were announced for seven of the accused in the August 2002 shooting, including
      a
      life sentence for the confessed leader of the attack.

On
      October 12, 2002, a bombing killed 202 people in the Indonesian province of
      Bali, which is 1,500 miles west of our mining and milling operations. Indonesian
      authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those
      arrested have been tried and convicted. On August 5, 2003, 12 people were killed
      and over 100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the JW
      Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. On September 9, 2004, 11 people were
      killed and over 200 others injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the
      Australian embassy. On October 1, 2005, three suicide bombers killed 19 people
      and wounded over 100 others in Bali. International terrorist organizations
      are
      suspected in each of these incidents. In November 2005, Indonesian Police raided
      a house in East Java that resulted in the death of other accused terrorists
      linked to these bombings. Our mining and milling operations were not interrupted
      by these incidents, but our corporate offices in Jakarta sustained damages
      and
      relocated for several months as a result of the September 2004
      bombing.


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

The
      Government of Indonesia, which provides security for PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

personnel and operations (see “Security Matters”), has expressed a strong
      commitment to protect natural resources businesses operating in Indonesia,
      including PT Freeport Indonesia, with heightened security following the
      incidents discussed above.

Economic
      and Social Conditions.

The
      Indonesian economy grew by an estimated 6 percent in 2006 and 2005. The
      Indonesian currency, the rupiah, averaged approximately 9,150 rupiah to one
      United States (U.S.) dollar during 2006 and closed at 8,989 rupiah to one U.S.
      dollar on December 29, 2006, compared with 9,825 rupiah to one U.S. dollar
      on
      December 30, 2005.

Despite
      gradual improvements on the economic front, Indonesia

’s

recovery
      remains vulnerable to ongoing political and social tensions. Pro-independence
      movements have been prominent in certain areas, especially in the province
      of
      Aceh, and to a lesser extent in Papua. In 2005, the Government of Indonesia
      and
      the Free Aceh Movement reached a peace agreement, which included the withdrawal
      of 24,000 military troops from Aceh. Subsequently, the U.S. restored full
      relations with the Indonesian military after a 14-year moratorium, partly
      because of the successes by the Government of Indonesia in fighting terrorism
      and in reaching a peaceful agreement in Aceh.

The
      area
      surrounding our mining development is sparsely populated by indigenous people
      and former residents of other areas of Indonesia, some of whom have resettled
      in
      Papua under the Government of Indonesia

’s

transmigration program. A segment of the local population is opposing Indonesian
      rule over Papua, and several separatist groups have sought political
      independence for the province. In addition to the August 31, 2002, shooting
      incident, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and
      sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the Indonesian
      military in Papua.

In
      2001,
      new autonomy laws became effective in Indonesia. The laws were intended to
      shift
      a greater share of revenues and greater control of economic, regulatory and
      social affairs to Indonesia’s 31 provinces and over 300 regencies. The central
      government and the provinces continue to consider the implementation and
      administration of these new responsibilities.

Our
      Contracts of Work and the Government of Indonesia.

The
      Indonesian government has assured investors that existing contracts would be
      honored. In our 39 years of operating in Indonesia, the Indonesian government
      has always honored its commitments to us. Our belief that our Contracts of
      Work
      will continue to be honored is further supported by U.S. laws, which prohibit
      U.S. aid to countries that nationalize property owned by, or take steps to
      nullify a contract with, a U.S. citizen or company at least 50 percent owned
      by
      U.S. citizens if the foreign country does not within a reasonable time take
      appropriate steps to provide full value compensation or other relief under
      international law.

In
      July
      2004, we received a request from the Indonesian Department of Energy and Mineral
      Resources that we offer to sell shares in PT Indocopper Investama to Indonesian
      nationals at fair market value. PT Indocopper Investama, which we wholly own,
      has an approximate 9.36 percent ownership interest in PT Freeport Indonesia.
      In
      response to this request and in view of the potential benefits of having
      additional Indonesian ownership in our operations, we have agreed to consider
      a
      potential sale of an interest in PT Indocopper Investama at fair market value.
      Neither our Contract of Work nor Indonesian law requires us to divest any
      portion of our ownership interest in PT Freeport Indonesia or PT Indocopper
      Investama.

Our
      Investment in Indonesia and Papua.

We have
      a board-approved policy on social, employment and human rights, and have
      comprehensive and extensive social, cultural and community development programs,
      to which we have committed significant financial and managerial resources.
      See
“Social Development, Employment and Human Rights.” These policies and programs
      are designed to address the impact of our operations on the local villages
      and
      people and to provide assistance for the development of the local people. While
      we believe these efforts serve to avoid damage to and disruptions of our
      operations, our operations could be adversely affected by social, economic
      and
      political forces beyond our control.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia contributes to the economies of Papua and the Republic of
      Indonesia through the payment of taxes, dividends and royalties; economic
      development programs; infrastructure development; employment and the purchase
      of
      local and national goods. PT Freeport Indonesia has frequently been one of
      the
      largest taxpayers in the Republic of Indonesia. In addition, it pays royalties
      on all minerals removed from the ground. Royalty payments are based on the
      volumes and prices of minerals sold in accordance with the terms of PT Freeport
      Indonesia’s Contract of Work, as discussed above.


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

Since
      it
      began development activities more than 35 years ago, PT Freeport Indonesia
      has
      made significant investments in infrastructure both for its use and for use
      by
      the Papuan public. These infrastructure improvements include medical facilities,
      roads, an airport and heliports, schools, housing, community buildings and
      places of worship.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia is also one of the largest private employers in Indonesia
      and
      by far the largest in Papua. As of December 31, 2006, PT Freeport Indonesia
      directly employed 8,957 people, and 6,141 contract workers provided services
      to
      PT Freeport Indonesia. In addition, 4,579 persons worked for privatized
      companies providing services within PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

operations area.

Besides
      the estimated $5.1 billion in direct benefits from taxes, royalties, dividends
      and fees paid to the Indonesian government under the Contract of Work from
      through 2006, PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations have provided an additional
      estimated $11.1 billion during this period in indirect benefits to Papua and
      the
      Republic of Indonesia in the form of wages and benefits paid to workers,
      purchases of goods and services, charitable contributions and reinvestments
      in
      operations. For 2006, direct benefits paid to the Indonesian government totaled
      approximately $1.6 billion and indirect benefits totaled approximately $1.1
      billion. In addition, approximately $0.2 billion of direct benefits
      attributable to 2006 operations is being paid during the first quarter of
      2007 in accordance with the terms of the Contract of Work.

Ore
      Reserves

During
      2006, PT Freeport Indonesia added 41.8 million metric tons of ore averaging
      0.66
      percent copper and 0.70 grams per metric ton (g/t) of gold associated with
      positive drilling results at the Mill Level Zone and Deep Mill Level Zone
      deposits, a 387-million-metric-ton complex with average grades of 1.02 percent
      copper and 0.81 g/t of gold. PT Freeport Indonesia’s reserve estimates also
      reflect revisions resulting from changes to its long-range mine
      plans.

During
      the fourth quarter of 2006, PT Freeport Indonesia completed an analysis of
      its
      longer-range mine plans to assess the optimal design of the Grasberg open pit
      and the timing of development of the Grasberg underground block cave ore body.
      The analysis incorporated the latest geological and geotechnical studies, costs
      and other economic factors in developing the optimal timing for transitioning
      from the open pit to underground. The revised long-range plan includes changes
      to the expected final Grasberg open-pit design which will result in a section
      of
      high-grade ore previously expected to be mined in the open pit to be mined
      in
      the Grasberg underground block cave mine. Approximately 100 million metric
      tons
      of high-grade ore in the southwest corner (located in the "8 South" pushback)
      of
      the open pit, with aggregate recoverable metal approximating 4 billion pounds
      of
      copper and 5 million ounces of gold, is expected to be mined through PT Freeport
      Indonesia's large scale block caving operations rather than from open-pit
      mining. The revised mine plan reflects a transition from the Grasberg open
      pit
      to the Grasberg underground block cave ore body currently estimated to occur
      in
      mid-2015.

The
      mine
      plan revisions alter the timing of metal production in the period of 2015 and
      beyond but do not have a significant effect on ultimate recoverable reserves.
      The success of PT Freeport Indonesia's underground operations and the
      significant progress to establish underground infrastructure provides confidence
      in developing the high-grade, large-scale underground ore bodies in the Grasberg
      minerals district. PT Freeport Indonesia will continue to assess opportunities
      to optimize the long-range mine plans and net present values of the Grasberg
      minerals district.

Year-end
      aggregate proven and probable recoverable reserves, net of 2006 production,
      were
      2.8 billion metric tons of ore averaging 1.04 percent copper, 0.90 g/t of gold
      and 4.16 g/t of silver representing 54.8 billion pounds of copper, 54.3 million
      ounces of gold and 184.5 million ounces of silver. Our aggregate exploration
      budget for 2007, including Rio Tinto

’s

share,
      is expected to total approximately $31 million ($25 million for our share).
      PT
      Freeport Indonesia’s exploration efforts in 2007 within Block A will continue to
      test extensions of the Deep Grasberg and Kucing Liar mine complex. Engineering
      studies are under way to incorporate positive drilling results from 2006
      activities at Deep Grasberg and Kucing Liar. PT Freeport Indonesia also expects
      to test the open-pit potential of the Wanagon gold prospect and the Ertsberg
      open-pit resource, and will begin testing for extensions of the Deep Mill Level
      Zone deposit and other targets in the space between the Ertsberg and Grasberg
      mineral systems from the new Common Infrastructure tunnels (see “Mining
      Operations - Mines in Development”) located at the 2,500 meter
      level.



Pursuant
      to joint venture arrangements between PT Freeport Indonesia and Rio Tinto,
      Rio
      Tinto has a 40 percent interest in production from reserves above those reported
      at December 31, 1994. Net of Rio Tinto

’s

share,
      PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

share of
      proven and probable recoverable reserves as of December 31, 2006, was 38.8
      billion pounds of copper, 41.1 million ounces of gold and 128.0 million ounces
      of silver. FCX

’s

equity
      interest in proven and probable recoverable reserves as of December 31, 2006,
      was 35.2 billion pounds of copper, 37.2 million ounces of gold and 116.0 million
      ounces of silver. We estimated recoverable reserves using a copper price of
      $1.00 per pound and a gold price of $400 per ounce. If metal prices were
      adjusted to the approximate average London spot prices for the past three years,
      i.e., copper prices adjusted from $1.00 per pound to $2.01 per pound and gold
      prices adjusted from $400 per ounce to $486 per ounce, the resulting additional
      proven and probable reserves would not be material to our reported
      reserves.

All
      of
      our proven and probable recoverable reserves lie within Block A. Aggregate
      Grasberg open pit and underground proven and probable recoverable ore reserves
      as of December 31, 2006, are shown below along with those of our other deposits.
      Reserve calculations were prepared by our employees under the supervision of
      George D. MacDonald, our Vice President of Exploration, and were reviewed and
      verified by Independent Mining Consultants, Inc., experts in mining, geology
      and
      reserve determination. See “Risk Factors.” We developed our current mine plan
      based on completing the mining of all of our currently designated recoverable
      reserves before the end of 2041, which would be the expiration of our Contract
      of Work including the two 10-year extensions discussed above. Prior to the
      expiration of the initial term of our Contract of Work in December 2021, under
      our current mine plan we expect to mine approximately 39 percent of aggregate
      proven and probable ore, representing approximately 45 percent of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

share of
      recoverable copper reserves and approximately 59 percent of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

                97.0
                percent for gold and 76.9 percent for silver. The term “recoverable
                reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit which we estimate can be
                economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the
                reserve
                determination.

In
      defining its open-pit reserves, PT Freeport Indonesia applies an “economic
      cutoff grade” strategy. The objective of this strategy is to maximize the net
      present value of its operations. PT Freeport Indonesia uses a break-even cutoff
      grade to define the insitu reserves for its underground ore bodies. The
      break-even cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent
      copper grade, once produced and sold, that generates sufficient revenue to
      cover
      all operating and administrative costs associated with its
      production.

Our
      reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical
      studies. We conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic
      values and to manage risk. We revise our mine plans and estimates of proven
      and
      probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available
      studies.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia’s ores contain three commercially recoverable metals: copper,
      gold and silver. We value all three metals in terms of a copper equivalent
      percentage to determine a single break-even cutoff grade. Copper equivalent
      percentage is used to express the relative value of multi-metal ores in terms
      of
      one metal. The calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using
      estimates of contained metal quantities, metals prices as used for reserve
      determination, recovery rates, treatment charges and royalties. The table below
      shows the break-even cutoff grade, expressed as a copper equivalent percentage,
      for each of our existing ore bodies as of December 31, 2006.

The
      following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing for each of our ore
      bodies. Drill hole spacing data are used by mining professionals, such as mining
      engineers, in determining the suitability of data coverage (on a relative basis)
      in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given
      level of confidence in the resource estimate. Drill hole spacing is only one
      of
      several criteria necessary to establish resource classification. Drilling
      programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support
      the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of
      development of a mineral deposit. We calculate the average drill hole spacing
      within each ore body using the distance from the center of each block in the
      resource model to the nearest drill hole composite. We then calculate the
      averages of these values within the volume of each ore body and reported them
      under the column entitled “Average Distance: To Nearest Sample.” This value
      represents at least one-half of the average drill hole spacing within each
      deposit. We calculate the value under the column entitled “Average Distance:
      Between Drill Holes” by multiplying the average minimum distance value by two,
      and this value represents the maximum average drill hole spacing.

Mining
      Operations - Mines in Production

We
      and
      our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in Block
      A
      since 1967 and have been the only operator of these operations. We currently
      have two mines in operation: the Grasberg open pit and the Deep Ore Zone block
      cave.

Grasberg
      Open Pit.

We
      began
      open-pit mining of the Grasberg ore body in 1990. Open-pit operations are
      expected to continue until mid-2015 at which time the Grasberg underground
      mining operations are scheduled to begin. Production is currently at the 3,340-
      to 4,285-meter elevation level and totaled 63.7 million metric tons of ore
      in


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

      and
      60.3 million metric tons of ore in 2005, which provided 80 percent of our 2006
      mill feed and 81 percent of our 2005 mill feed. Our open-pit mining rate,
      including ore and overburden, totaled 677,200 metric tons per day in 2006 and
      691,600 metric tons per day in 2005. Approximate annual production rates are
      expected to range between 650,000 metric tons per day and 750,000 metric tons
      per day through 2010 and then decline through 2015. We are studying potential
      capital outlays for additional haul trucks, which would be above the expected
      maintenance capital costs that will be incurred during the pit’s remaining
      life.

The
      current Grasberg equipment fleet consists of over 675 units. As of December
      31,
      2006, the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes
      168 haul trucks with payloads ranging from approximately 70 metric tons to
      metric tons, 18 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 29 cubic meters to 42
      cubic meters and 65 bulldozers and graders. Besides the potential purchases
      of
      haul trucks discussed above, we believe our current equipment level is adequate
      to meet our projected production levels over the remaining life of the
      pit.

Grasberg
      crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity
      to transport up to 225,000 metric tons per day of Grasberg ore to the mill
      and
      135,000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden
      stockpiles.

Mining
      costs are charged to operations as incurred. However, because of the
      configuration and location of the Grasberg open-pit ore body and the location
      and extent of the related surrounding overburden, the ratio of overburden to
      ore
      is much higher in the initial mining of the open pit than in later years. In
      2005 and years prior, surface mining costs associated with overburden removal
      at
      PT Freeport Indonesia’s Grasberg open-pit mine that were estimated to relate to
      future production were initially deferred when the ratio of actual overburden
      removed to ore mined exceeded the estimated average ratio of overburden removed
      to ore mined over the life of the Grasberg open-pit mine, as projected in our
      most recent mine plan. Those deferred costs were to be charged subsequently
      to
      operating costs when the ratio of actual overburden removed to ore mined fell
      below the estimated average ratio of overburden to ore over the life of the
      Grasberg open-pit mine. The reserve quantities used to develop the life of
      mine
      ratio are the proven and probable ore quantities for the Grasberg open pit
      shown
      above.

In
      the
      mining industry, the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access
      mineral deposits are referred to as “stripping costs.” Through December 31,
      2005, we applied the deferred mining cost method in accounting for our
      post-production stripping costs. The deferred mining cost method was used by
      some companies in the metals mining industry; however, industry practice varied.
      The deferred mining cost method matches the cost of production with the sale
      of
      the related metal from the open pit by assigning each metric ton of ore removed
      an equivalent amount of overburden tonnage, thereby averaging overburden removal
      costs over the life of the mine. The mining cost capitalized in inventory and
      the amounts charged to cost of goods sold do not represent the actual costs
      incurred to mine the ore in any given period. The application of the deferred
      mining cost method resulted in an asset on FCX’s balance sheet (“Deferred Mining
      Costs”) totaling $285.4 million at December 31, 2005 (see Note 1).

On
      January 1, 2006, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-6,
“Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining
      Industry” (EITF 04-6), which requires that stripping costs incurred during
      production be considered costs of the extracted minerals and included as a
      component of inventory to be recognized in cost of sales in the same period
      as
      the revenue from the sale of that inventory (see Note 1). Upon adoption of
      EITF
      04-6, we recorded our deferred mining costs asset ($285.4 million) at December
      31, 2005, net of taxes, minority interest share and inventory effects ($135.9
      million), as a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce our retained earnings
      on
      January 1, 2006. In addition, stripping costs incurred in 2006 and later periods
      are now charged to cost of sales as prescribed by EITF 04-6. As a result of
      adopting EITF 04-6 on January 1, 2006, our income before income taxes and
      minority interests for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $35.4 million
      lower
      and net income was $18.8 million ($0.10 per basic share and $0.08 per diluted
      share) lower than if we had not adopted EITF 04-6 and continued to defer
      stripping costs. Stripping costs are now charged to cost of sales as prescribed
      by EITF 04-6. Adoption of the new guidance has no impact on our cash flows.
      The
      pro forma impact of applying EITF 04-6 would be to reduce net income by $35.3
      million or $0.16 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2005, and
      $39.4 million or $0.21 per diluted share for the year ended December 31,
      2004.

Deep
      Ore Zone.

The
      Deep
      Ore Zone ore body lies vertically below the now depleted Intermediate Ore Zone
      ore body. We began production from the Deep Ore Zone ore body in 1989 using
      open
      stope mining methods, but we suspended production in 1991 in favor of production
      from the Grasberg deposit. Production resumed in September 2000 using the
      block-cave method. Production is at the 3,110-meter elevation level and totaled
      16.5 million metric tons of ore in 2006 and 15.3 million metric tons of ore
      in
      2005. The Deep Ore Zone continues to perform above


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

design
      capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per day. Production from the Deep Ore
      Zone
      averaged 45,200 metric tons of ore per day in 2006 and 42,000 metric tons of
      ore
      per day in 2005.

During
      2006 at the Deep Ore Zone mine, we completed over 12,000 meters of development
      drifting in support of the block-cave mining method and the ongoing expansion
      to
      50,000 metric tons of ore per day. The expansion to a sustained rate of 50,000
      metric tons of ore per day is expected to be completed in mid-2007. The
      cumulative aggregate development costs for the Deep Ore Zone expansion through
      December 31, 2006, totaled approximately $56 million (approximately $34 million
      for PT Freeport Indonesia’s share) and the aggregate development costs for 2007
      are expected to total approximately $4 million (approximately $2 million for
      PT
      Freeport Indonesia’s share). We anticipate a further expansion of the Deep Ore
      Zone operation to 80,000 metric tons of ore per day, with budgeted capital
      of
      approximately $18 million (approximately $11 million for PT Freeport Indonesia’s
      share) in 2007. The success of the development of the Deep Ore Zone mine, one
      of
      the world’s largest underground mines, provides confidence in the future
      development of PT Freeport Indonesia’s large-scale undeveloped ore
      bodies.

The
      Deep
      Ore Zone mine fleet consists of over 160 pieces of mobile heavy equipment.
      The
      primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development
      includes 45 load-haul-dump (LHD) units and 16 haul trucks. Our production LHD
      units typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore. Using ore passes
      and
      chutes, the LHD units transfer ore into 55-ton capacity haul trucks. The trucks
      dump into a gyratory crusher and ore is then conveyed to the surface
      stockpiles.

Our
      development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production
      activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable reserves including
      adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of
      overburden. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets is
      determined using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable
      proven and probable copper reserves. Development costs that relate to a specific
      ore body are depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on estimated
      recoverable proven and probable copper reserves for the ore body benefited.
      PT
      Freeport Indonesia’s total development costs at December 31, 2006, for the Deep
      Ore Zone mine, currently our only operating underground mine, totaled
      approximately $224 million, which are being depreciated on a unit-of-production
      basis over the life of the Deep Ore Zone proven and probable reserves (see
      Note
      1).

The
      majority of maintenance activities are performed on site by a combination of
      PT
      Freeport Indonesia employees and contract workers. As of December 31, 2006,
      we
      had approximately 7,000 employees and contract workers directly involved in
      Grasberg open-pit and Deep Ore Zone underground mining, milling and ore flow
      operations.

Our
      principal source of power for all our operations is a coal-fired power plant
      that we built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator mill expansion (see
      “Infrastructure”). Diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power
      generating capacity. A combination of naturally occurring mountain streams
      and
      water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations.
      The average annual rainfall in the project area is 185 inches.

Mining
      Operations - Mines in Development

Seven
      other ore bodies (the underground Grasberg, Kucing Liar, Mill Level Zone, Deep
      Mill Level Zone, Ertsberg Stockwork Zone, Big Gossan and the Dom) are located
      in
      Block A. These ore bodies are at various stages of development, and are included
      in our proven and probable recoverable reserves. We continually review our
      operation’s development opportunities to maximize the value of the reserves. We
      incurred $61.4 million for mine development, expansion and infrastructure
      capital expenditures related to these ore bodies and $49.5 million for common
      underground infrastructure development during the three years ended December
      31,
      2006. See “Risk Factors.”

The
      underground Grasberg reserves will be mined using the block-cave method at
      the
      end of open-pit mining, which is expected to continue until approximately
      mid-2015. The Kucing Liar ore body lies on the southern flank of and underneath
      the southern portion of the Grasberg open pit at the 2,605- to 3,115-meter
      elevation level. We expect to mine the Kucing Liar ore body using the block-cave
      method.

The
      Mill
      Level Zone ore body lies directly below the Deep Ore Zone mine at the
      2,890-meter elevation. The Deep Mill Level Zone ore body lies beneath the Mill
      Level Zone ore body at the 2,590-meter elevation. This ore represents the
      downward continuation of mineralization in the Ertsberg East Skarn system and
      neighboring Ertsberg porphyry. Drilling efforts continue to determine the extent
      of these ore bodies. We expect to mine the Mill Level

      OF CONTENTS

Zone
      ore
      body using a block-cave method near completion of mining at the Deep Ore Zone
      ore body. Near the end of mining the Mill Level Zone ore body, we expect to
      mine
      the Deep Mill Level Zone ore body also using a block-cave method.

The
      Ertsberg Stockwork Zone ore body extends off the southwest side of the Deep
      Ore
      Zone ore body at the 3,126- to 3,626-meter elevation level. Drilling efforts
      continue to determine the extent of this ore body, which we expect to mine
      using
      a block-cave method starting in about 2008.

The
      Big
      Gossan ore body is located approximately 1,000 meters southwest of the original
      Ertsberg open-pit deposit. We began the initial underground development of
      the
      ore body in 1993 when we drove tunnels from the mill area into the ore zone
      at
      the 3,000-meter elevation level. A stope and fill mining method will be used
      on
      the Big Gossan deposit. In 2005, we completed a feasibility study and an update
      to the site-wide development plan to determine the timing of initial production,
      currently projected to be 2008.

The
      Dom
      ore body lies approximately 1,500 meters southeast of the depleted Ertsberg
      open-pit deposit. Production at the open-pit and underground portions of the
      ore
      body will begin after completion of open-pit mining at Grasberg.

In
      2004,
      PT Freeport Indonesia commenced its “Common Infrastructure” project, which will
      provide access to its large undeveloped underground ore bodies located in the
      Grasberg minerals district through a tunnel system located approximately 400
      meters deeper than its existing underground tunnel system. In addition to
      providing access to our underground ore bodies, the tunnel system will enable
      PT
      Freeport Indonesia to conduct future exploration in prospective areas associated
      with currently identified ore bodies. The tunnel system has reached the Big
      Gossan terminal and PT Freeport Indonesia is proceeding with development of
      the
      lower Big Gossan infrastructure. PT Freeport Indonesia has also advanced
      development of the Grasberg spur and as of December 31, 2006, has completed
      percent of the tunneling required to reach the Grasberg underground ore body.
      PT
      Freeport Indonesia expects the Grasberg spur to reach the Grasberg underground
      ore body and to initiate multi-year mine development activities in the second
      half of 2007.

The
      projected aggregate capital expenditures required to reach full production
      capacity for each of our undeveloped ore bodies based on our latest mine plans
      and our proven and probable recoverable reserves as of December 31, 2006, are
      shown below in millions of U.S. dollars. Actual costs could differ materially
      from these estimates as we will not incur most of the expenditures for several
      years and we will incur them over a period of several years. In addition to
      the
      mine development costs below, our current mine development plans include
      approximately $1 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities
      to
      optimize the handling of underground ore types once Grasberg open-pit operations
      cease. We continue to review our processing plans to maximize the value of
      our
      reserves. Based on our current estimates, we expect aggregate expenditures
      will
      range between approximately $100 million and $320 million annually, during
      the
      next 15 years. In addition, these costs will be shared with Rio Tinto in
      accordance with our joint venture agreement.

Description
      of Ore Bodies.

Our
      ore
      bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions, the Grasberg
      monzodiorite and the Ertsberg diorite. The host rocks of these ore bodies
      include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper
      flanks of the Sudirman Range, and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic
      composition that intrude them. The igneous-hosted ore bodies (the Grasberg
      open
      pit and block cave, and the Ertsberg Stockwork Zone block cave) occur as vein
      stockworks and disseminations of copper sulphides, dominated by chalcopyrite
      and, to a much lesser extent, bornite. The sedimentary-rock hosted ore bodies
      occur as “magnetite-rich, calcium/magnesian skarn” replacements, whose location
      and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry
      of
      the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions.

The
      copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is also dominated by chalcopyrite,
      but higher bornite concentrations are common. Moreover, gold occurs in
      significant concentrations in all of the district

’s

ore
      bodies, though rarely visible to the naked eye. These gold concentrations
      usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulphide minerals, though, in
      some
      deposits, these concentrations can also be strongly associated with
      pyrite.


The
      following diagram indicates the relative elevations (in meters) of our reported
      reserve ore bodies.


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

The
      following map, which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers
      (approximately 16 square miles), indicates the relative positions and sizes
      of
      our reported reserve ore bodies and their locations.



The
      following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing
      each
      of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect that production
      of
      each ore body will begin and end. Production volumes are typically lower in
      the
      first few years of each ore body as development activities are ongoing and
      as
      the mine ramps up to full production. Currently, the Grasberg open pit and
      Deep
      Ore Zone are our only producing mines. The ultimate timing of the start of
      production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors,
      including the results of our exploration and development efforts, and may vary
      from the dates shown below. In addition, we develop our mine plans for the
      Grasberg open pit and underground mines based on maximizing the net present
      value from the ore bodies.

During
      2006, we mined an average of 722,400 metric tons of material per day, including
      ore and overburden. We do not require any additional approvals for higher mining
      rates. During 2005, we mined an average of 733,600 metric tons of material
      per
      day. The following chart illustrates our current aggregate mill capacity; our
      aggregate permitted mill capacity and our projected milling rates. Mill capacity
      will vary with the ore type being processed. The decline in milling rates in
      2015 reflects the expected completion date of open-pit mining at the Grasberg
      ore body. We are continuing to develop mine plans to optimize production
      levels.


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

Milling
      and Production

The
      ore
      from our mines moves by a conveyor system to a series of shafts through which
      it
      drops to our milling and concentrating complex located approximately 2,900
      meters above sea level. At the mill, the ore is crushed and ground and mixed
      in
      tanks with water and small amounts of flotation reagents where it is
      continuously agitated with air. During this physical separation process,
      copper-, gold- and silver-bearing particles rise to the top of the tanks and
      are
      collected and thickened into a concentrate. The concentrate leaves the mill
      complex as a slurry, consisting of approximately 65 percent solids by weight,
      and is pumped through three parallel 115-kilometer pipelines to our coastal
      port
      site facility at Amamapare where it is filtered, dried and stored for shipping.
      Ships are loaded at dock facilities at the port until they draw their maximum
      dock-side water, and they then move to deeper water, where loading is completed
      from shuttling barges.

Our
      production results for the last three years are as follows:

TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

Although
      average mill throughput increased by six percent to 229,400 metric tons of
      ore
      per day from 216,200 metric tons per day in 2005, we mined lower grade ore
      and
      reported lower production in 2006, compared with 2005. Copper production for
      2006 totaled 1.2 billion pounds, 254.7 million pounds lower than 2005
      production. Gold production for 2006 totaled 1.7 million ounces, 1.1 million
      ounces lower than 2005 production. Average unit net cash costs for 2006
      increased to $0.60 per pound from $0.07 per pound for 2005, as a result of
      higher unit production costs (resulting from lower volumes, higher input costs
      and the impact of changes in accounting for stripping costs) and higher
      treatment charges and royalties attributable to increased copper
      prices.

Mill
      throughput and production improved significantly in 2005 compared to 2004,
      which
      was negatively affected by PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

efforts
      to accelerate removal of overburden material and restore safe access to
      higher-grade areas in the pit (see below). Mill throughput averaged 216,200
      metric tons of ore per day in 2005, a 17 percent increase from the 185,100
      metric tons average in 2004. Copper and gold production was higher in 2005
      compared with 2004 reflecting the higher mill throughput and higher average
      ore
      grades. Copper production for 2005 totaled 1.46 billion pounds, 459.4 million
      pounds higher than 2004 production. Gold production for 2005 totaled 2.79
      million ounces, 1.3 million ounces higher than 2004 production. The higher
      sales
      volumes and the primarily fixed nature of a large portion of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

cost
      structure resulted in average unit net cash costs for 2005 decreasing to $0.07
      per pound compared with $0.40 per pound for 2004.

In
      October 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a section of the Grasberg
      open
      pit and in December 2003, a smaller debris flow occurred in the same section.
      The area affected by the slippage events included two active mining areas which
      were scheduled to be mined in the fourth quarter of 2003 (see “Grasberg Open-Pit
      Slippage”). Mill throughput and production in 2004 was negatively affected by PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

efforts
      to accelerate removal of overburden material and restore safe access to
      higher-grade areas in the pit.

Because
      of the fixed nature of a large portion of our costs, unit costs vary
      significantly from period to period depending on volumes of copper and gold
      sold
      during the period. In addition, we have experienced significant increases in
      our
      production costs in recent years primarily as a result of higher energy costs
      and costs of other consumables, higher mining costs and milling rates, labor
      costs and other factors. Once we complete our open-pit mining operations at
      the
      Grasberg mine in approximately mid-2015 and transition to underground, we expect
      our share of annual copper and gold production to be lower than current levels,
      and all other factors being equal, our average unit net cash costs to increase.
      For more information regarding our operating and financial results, see our
      Annual Report incorporated herein by reference.

We
      estimate our share of sales for 2007 to approximate 1.1 billion pounds of copper
      and 1.8 million ounces of gold. Average annual sales volumes over the five-year
      period from 2007 through 2011 are expected to approximate 1.24 billion pounds
      of
      copper and 1.8 million ounces of gold. The achievement of PT Freeport
      Indonesia’s sales estimates will be dependent, among other factors, on the
      achievement of targeted mining rates, the successful operation of PT Freeport
      Indonesia production facilities, the impact of weather conditions at the end
      of
      fiscal periods on concentrate loading activities and other factors. See “Risk
      Factors.”

Geotechnical
      Programs

Our
      geotechnical programs support several phases of the operations, including our
      open-pit mine (pit slope and overburden stockpile stability), our underground
      mine, our infrastructure and our tailings management program. For information
      regarding our tailings management program, see “Environmental
      Matters.”

A
      group
      of our senior level employees has the responsibility, authority and oversight
      for our overall geotechnical programs. Our multi-disciplinary approach combines
      in-house personnel with backgrounds in civil, geotechnical, mining engineering,
      geology and hydrology to form a technical services group that reports to our
      senior managers. Our technical services group develops information that our
      mine
      engineering group uses to develop mine and stockpile designs, production
      schedules and related plans. Our technical services group also monitors slope
      stability and other geotechnical and hydrological developments.

Our
      technical services group is composed of expatriates and Indonesian nationals,
      who are university educated. International consulting experts in each of the
      applicable technical fields also provide additional support to this group.
      In-house training provided by consultants as well as off-site seminars and
      industry conferences supports the training of our staff. Our joint venture
      partner has also provided geotechnical and engineering support to our
      operations. Consultants and our joint venture partner provide input into program
      development and assess performance of these critical roles.



Our
      technical services group uses information from geological drilling for the
      development and updating of our geological, geotechnical and hydrologic models.
      We develop computer-based geologic models for mine design and dewatering
      programs. We provide continuous ground and slope monitoring in our mines and
      on
      overburden stockpiles using various computerized and automated systems. We
      also
      daily inspect all open-pit working areas, with any items of concern being
      reported to our senior managers. Our hydrology function measures and tracks
      water flow patterns to determine the effectiveness and need for de-watering
      and
      depressurization programs. We drain all surface flows away from the open pit
      and
      pump any in-pit surface water to dedicated drain holes connected to our
      underground de-watering drift system. We also continuously monitor rainfall
      at
      our operations so that we may adjust for operational impacts and safety
      considerations.

Grasberg
      Open-Pit Slippage

On
      October 9, 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a section of the Grasberg
      open pit. Eight workers perished and five workers were injured in the incident.
      The area affected by the slippage, comprising approximately five percent of
      the
      surface area of the massive Grasberg pit, included two active mining areas
      that
      were scheduled to be mined in 2003 and 2004. On December 12, 2003, a debris
      flow
      involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same
      area
      of the Grasberg open pit resulting in only minor property damage. Following
      these two events, PT Freeport Indonesia redirected its open-pit operations
      to
      accelerate removal of waste material from the south wall to restore safe access
      to the higher-grade ore areas in the pit. These activities resulted in reduced
      production levels. In April 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia established safe access
      and initiated mining in higher-grade ore areas while continuing waste removal
      activities. PT Freeport Indonesia resumed normal milling rates in June
      2004.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia maintains property damage and business interruption insurance
      related to its operations. In December 2004, we entered into an insurance
      settlement agreement and settled all claims that arose from the fourth-quarter
      2003 slippage and debris flow events in the Grasberg open-pit mine. PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

insurers
      agreed to pay an aggregate of $125.0 million in connection with its claims.
      After considering our joint venture partner

’s

interest
      in the proceeds, PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

share of
      proceeds totaled $95.0 million.

Exploration

As
      a
      result of our joint venture arrangements, Rio Tinto generally pays for 40
      percent of our joint venture exploration and exploratory drilling costs in
      Papua. The joint ventures incurred total exploration costs of $16.7 million
      in
      2006 and $13.3 million in 2005. The joint ventures’ exploration budget for 2007,
      including Rio Tinto’s share, is expected to total approximately $31 million ($25
      million for our share). PT Freeport Indonesia’s exploration efforts in 2007
      within Block A will continue to test extensions of the Deep Grasberg and Kucing
      Liar mine complex. Engineering studies are under way to incorporate positive
      drilling results from 2006 activities at Deep Grasberg and Kucing Liar. PT
      Freeport Indonesia also expects to test the open-pit potential of the Wanagon
      gold prospect and the Ertsberg open-pit resource, and will begin testing for
      extensions of the Deep Mill Level Zone deposit and other targets in the space
      between the Ertsberg and Grasberg mineral systems from the new Common
      Infrastructure tunnels located at the 2,500 meter level. During 2007, we plan
      to
      resume exploration activities, which had been suspended in recent years, in
      certain prospective areas outside Block A.

In
      June
      1998, we entered into a joint venture agreement to conduct exploration
      activities in PT Nabire Bakti Mining

’s

Contract
      of Work area, which currently covers approximately 500,000 acres in several
      blocks contiguous to PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

Block B
      and one of Eastern Minerals’ blocks in Papua. Rio Tinto shares in 40 percent of
      our interest and costs in this exploration joint venture. We and Rio Tinto
      can
      earn up to a 62 percent interest in the PT Nabire Bakti Mining Contract of
      Work
      by spending up to $21 million on exploration and other activities in the joint
      venture areas. We have spent $18.0 million through December 31,
      2006.

With
      the
      subsequent approval of the Indonesian government, in 2000 we suspended our
      field
      exploration activities in Block B, which includes the Wabu Ridge gold prospect,
      as well as in the other Contract of Work areas of Eastern Minerals and PT Nabire
      Bakti Mining. The suspensions were because of safety and security issues and
      regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and
      exploration rights in certain forest areas and an Indonesian Forestry law
      enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining in forest preservation areas. Recent
      Indonesian legislation permits open-pit mining in PT Freeport Indonesia’s Block
      B area, subject to certain requirements. Following an assessment of these
      requirements and a review of security issues, we plan to resume exploration
      activities in certain prospective Contract of Work areas outside of Block A
      in
      2007.



Infrastructure

The
      location of our mining operations in a remote area requires that our operations
      be virtually self-sufficient. In addition to the mining facilities described
      above, in the course of the development of our project we have constructed
      ourselves or participated with others in the construction of an airport, a
      port,
      a 119 kilometer road, an aerial tramway, two hospitals and related medical
      facilities, and two town sites with housing, schools and other facilities
      sufficient to support more than 17,000 persons.

In
      1996,
      we completed a significant infrastructure program, which includes various
      residential, community and commercial facilities. We designed the program to
      provide the infrastructure needed for our operations, to enhance the living
      conditions of our employees, and to develop and promote the growth of local
      and
      other third party activities and enterprises in Papua. We have developed the
      facilities through joint ventures or direct ownership involving local Indonesian
      interests and other investors.

In
      July
      2003, we acquired the 85.7 percent ownership interest in Puncakjaya Power owned
      by affiliates of Duke Energy Corporation for $68.1 million cash, net of $9.9
      million of cash acquired. Puncakjaya Power is the owner of assets supplying
      power to PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations, including the 3x65 megawatt
      coal-fired power facilities. PT Freeport Indonesia purchases power from
      Puncakjaya Power under infrastructure asset financing arrangements. In March
      2005, we prepaid $187.0 million of bank debt associated with Puncakjaya Power’s
      operations. At December 31, 2006, we had a $105.2 million loan outstanding
      to
      Puncakjaya Power, PT Freeport Indonesia had infrastructure asset financing
      obligations payable to Puncakjaya Power totaling $192.4 million and Puncakjaya
      Power had a receivable from PT Freeport Indonesia for $247.3 million, including
      Rio Tinto’s share. We consolidate PT Freeport Indonesia and Puncakjaya Power and
      our consolidated balance sheet only reflects a $54.6 million receivable ($8.6
      million in other accounts receivable and $46.0 million in long-term assets)
      for
      Rio Tinto’s share of Puncakjaya Power’s receivable as provided for in our joint
      venture agreement with Rio Tinto.

Marketing

PT
      Freeport Indonesia sells its copper concentrates, which contain significant
      quantities of gold and silver, under U.S. dollar-denominated sales agreements,
      mostly to companies in Asia and Europe and to international trading companies.
      We sell substantially all of our budgeted production of copper concentrates
      under long-term contracts with selling prices based on world metals prices
      (generally the London Metal Exchange settlement prices for Grade A copper).
      Under these contracts, initial billing occurs at the time of shipment and final
      settlement on the copper portion is generally based on average prices for a
      specified future period. Gold generally is sold at the average London Bullion
      Market Association price for a specified month near the month of
      shipment.

Revenues
      from concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties (see “Contracts of Work”),
      treatment and refining charges (including price participation charges, if
      applicable, based on the market prices of metals), and the impact of derivative
      financial instruments, if any, used to hedge against risks from metals price
      fluctuations. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper
      concentrates is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, our revenues
      from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity
      and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated
      term
      of our contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent
      payments to smelters and refiners and are either fixed or in certain cases
      vary
      with the price of copper. We sell a small amount of copper concentrates in
      the
      spot market. See “Risk Factors.”

We
      have
      commitments, including commitments from Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting, for
      essentially all of PT Freeport Indonesia’s estimated 2007 production. PT
      Freeport Indonesia has a long-term contract through December 2007 to provide
      Atlantic Copper with a quantity of copper concentrates at market prices which
      currently approximates 60 percent of Atlantic Copper

’s

annual
      copper concentrate requirements. PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

agreement with PT Smelting provides, for the life of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

mines,
      for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary
      to produce 205,000 metric tons of copper (essentially the Gresik
      smelter

’s

original
      design capacity) on a priority basis. In 2004, PT Smelting increased its stated
      production capacity to 250,000 metric tons of copper per year. During 2006,
      PT
      Smelting completed an expansion of its production capacity from 250,000 metric
      tons of copper per year to 275,000 metric tons. For the first 15 years of PT
      Smelting

’s

commercial operations beginning December 1998, PT Freeport Indonesia agreed
      that
      the treatment and refining charges on specified quantities of the concentrate
      PT
      Freeport Indonesia supplies will not fall below specified minimum rates, subject
      to renegotiation in 2008. The rate was $0.23 per pound, during the period from
      the commencement of PT Smelting

’s

operations in 1998 until April 3, 2004 when it declined to a minimum of $0.21
      per

pound.
      PT
      Smelting’s rates for 2007 are expected to exceed the minimum $0.21 per pound.
      Current rates are higher than the minimum rate. We anticipate that PT Freeport
      Indonesia will sell approximately 50 to 60 percent of its annual concentrate
      production to Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting. A summary of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

Investment
      in Smelters

Our
      investment in smelters (Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting) serves an important
      role in our concentrate marketing strategy. As discussed above, PT Freeport
      Indonesia generally sells approximately one-half of its concentrate production
      to its affiliated smelters, Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting, and the remainder
      to other customers. Treatment charges for smelting and refining copper
      concentrates represent a cost to PT Freeport Indonesia and income to Atlantic
      Copper and PT Smelting. Through downstream integration, we are assured placement
      of a significant portion of our concentrate production. Low smelter treatment
      and refining charges prior to 2005 adversely affected the operating results
      of
      Atlantic Copper and benefited the operating results of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

mining
      operations. Smelting and refining charges consist of a base rate and in certain
      contracts, price participation and price sharing based on copper prices. Market
      rates for treatment and refining charges have increased significantly since
      late
      2004 as worldwide smelter availability was insufficient to accommodate increased
      mine production and because of higher copper prices. However, more recently,
      we
      have begun to see these market rates decline. Higher treatment and refining
      charges benefit our smelter operations and adversely affect our mining
      operations. Taking into account taxes and minority ownership interests, an
      equivalent change in PT Freeport Indonesia’s and Atlantic Copper’s smelting and
      refining charge rates essentially offsets in our consolidated operating
      results.

Atlantic
      Copper, S.A.

We own
      100 percent of Atlantic Copper. Atlantic Copper completed the last expansion
      of
      its production capacity in 1997 and the design capacity of its smelter and
      its
      refinery are 290,000 metric tons of copper per year and its refinery currently
      has a nominal capacity of 260,000 metric tons of copper per year, respectively.
      We have no present plans to expand Atlantic Copper

’s

production capacity. During 2006, Atlantic Copper treated 953,700 metric tons
      of
      concentrate and scrap and produced 263,700 metric tons of new copper anodes.
      During 2005, Atlantic Copper treated 975,400 metric tons of concentrate and
      scrap and produced 284,200 metric tons of new copper anodes. Atlantic Copper’s
      positive financial results in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily reflect higher
      treatment charges, partially offset by higher unit costs. The next maintenance
      activity at Atlantic Copper is a 23-day maintenance turnaround currently
      scheduled for the second quarter of 2007, which is expected to adversely affect
      costs and volumes resulting in an approximate $25 million impact on 2007
      operating results. Major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately
      every nine years for Atlantic Copper, with significantly shorter term
      maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim. Atlantic Copper purchased
      approximately 42 percent of its 2006 concentrate requirements from PT Freeport
      Indonesia at market prices. Atlantic Copper has experienced no material
      operating problems, and we are not aware of any potential material environmental
      liabilities at Atlantic Copper.

We
      made
      no capital contributions to Atlantic Copper in 2005 and 2006; however, we
      contributed $202.0 million to Atlantic Copper in 2004. In addition, we loaned
      $189.5 million to Atlantic Copper in 2004. The funds were used to improve
      Atlantic Copper

’s

financial structure during its major maintenance turnaround and during a period
      of extremely low treatment and refining charge rates, which negatively affected
      Atlantic Copper

’s

results.
      Our net investment in Atlantic Copper through December 31, 2006, was
      approximately $170 million.

PT
      Smelting.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

Contract
      of Work required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in
      Indonesia if we and the Indonesian government determined that such a project
      would be economically viable. In 1995, following the completion of a feasibility
      study, we entered into agreements relating to the formation of PT Smelting
      and
      the construction of the copper smelter in Gresik, Indonesia.

PT
      Smelting is a joint venture among PT Freeport Indonesia, Mitsubishi Materials
      Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Mining & Metals Co., Ltd.,
      which own 25 percent, 60.5 percent, 9.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively,
      of
      the outstanding PT Smelting common stock. In accordance with the joint venture
      agreements, PT


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

Freeport
      Indonesia provides the majority of PT Smelting

’s

copper
      concentrate requirements. In December 2003, PT Smelting

’s

shareholder agreement was amended to eliminate PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

assignment of its earnings in PT Smelting to support a 13 percent cumulative
      annual return to the other owners for the first 20 years of operations. No
      amounts were paid under this assignment. PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

total
      investment in PT Smelting through December 31, 2006, was $100.6
      million.

During
      2006, PT Smelting treated 737,500 metric tons of concentrate and produced
      201,200 metric tons of new copper anodes. During 2005, PT Smelting treated
      908,900 metric tons of concentrate and produced 275,000 metric tons of new
      copper anodes. The lower volumes in 2006 primarily reflect a 22-day maintenance
      turnaround in the second quarter and PT Smelting’s temporary suspension of
      operations beginning in October 2006 and ending in mid-December 2006 following
      an equipment failure at the oxygen plant supplying the smelter. Major
      maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every four years for
      PT
      Smelting, with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the
      interim. The next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2008. In 2004,
      PT Smelting completed a refinery expansion during its maintenance turnaround,
      increasing its production capacity to approximately 250,000 metric tons of
      copper per year. During 2006, PT Smelting completed an expansion of its
      production capacity from 250,000 metric tons of copper per year to 275,000
      metric tons. We are not aware of any potential material environmental
      liabilities at PT Smelting.

Competition

We
      compete with other mining companies in the sale of our mineral concentrates
      and
      the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel. Some competing companies
      possess financial resources greater than ours and possess multiple mining assets
      less geographically concentrated in a single area than ours. We believe,
      however, that we are one of the lowest cost copper producers in the world,
      after
      taking into account credits for related gold and silver production, which gives
      us a significant competitive advantage.

Social
      Development, Employment and Human Rights

We
      have a
      social, employment and human rights policy designed to result in our operating
      in compliance with the laws in the areas of our operations, and in a manner
      that
      respects basic human rights and the culture of the people who are indigenous
      to
      the area. We continue to make significant expenditures on social and cultural
      activities, primarily in Papua. These activities include:

·

comprehensive
                job training programs;

·

basic
                education programs;

·

several
                public health programs, including extensive malaria
                control;

·

agricultural
                assistance programs;

·

a
                business incubator program to encourage the local people to establish
                their own small scale businesses;

·

cultural
                preservation programs; and

·

charitable
                donations.

In
      1996,
      PT Freeport Indonesia agreed to commit at least one percent of its revenues
      to
      the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development (formerly the Freeport
      Fund for Irian Jaya Development) to support village-based health, education,
      economic and social development programs in its area of operations. This
      commitment replaced our community development programs in which we spent a
      similar amount of money each year. Our share of contributions to the Freeport
      Partnership Fund for Community Development totaled $43.9 million in 2006, $35.7
      million in 2005 and $17.5 million in 2004. Our joint venture partner, Rio Tinto,
      also contributes to this fund and including their share the contributions
      totaled $47.6 million in 2006, $42.3 million in 2005 and $19.0 million in
      2004.

Lembaga
      Pembangunan Masyarakat Amungme Kamoro (LPMAK) oversees disbursement of the
      amounts we contribute to the fund. LPMAK

’s

board of
      commissioners is made up of a leader of the Amungme people, a leader of the
      Kamoro people, leaders of the three local churches, a representative of the
      local government and a representative of PT Freeport Indonesia. The Amungme
      and
      Kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of
      operations.

We
      believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to
      the
      issues raised by the local villages and people and should help us to avoid
      disruptions of mining operations. Nevertheless, social and political instability
      in the area may adversely impact our mining operations. See “Risk
      Factors.”



In
      December 2000, we endorsed the joint U.S. State Department-British Foreign
      Office Voluntary Principles on Human Rights and Security. Several major natural
      resources companies and international human rights organizations participated
      in
      developing the Voluntary Principles and have endorsed them. We participated
      in
      developing these principles and incorporated them into our social and human
      rights policy.

Security
      Matters

Consistent
      with our Contract of Work and the requirement to protect our employees and
      property, we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working
      environment. As part of its security program, PT Freeport Indonesia maintains
      its own internal security department, which performs functions such as
      protecting company facilities, monitoring the shipment of company goods through
      the airport and terminal, assisting in traffic control and aiding rescue
      operations. PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

civilian
      security employees (numbering about 675) are unarmed and perform duties
      consistent with their internal security role. PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

share of
      costs for its internal civilian security department totaled $14.2 million for
      2006, $11.3 million for 2005 and $12.3 million for 2004. The security department
      has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his
      or
      her compliance with our human rights policy.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia, and all businesses and residents of Indonesia, relies on
      the
      Government of Indonesia for the provision of public order, upholding the rule
      of
      law and the protection of personnel and property. The Grasberg mine has been
      designated by the Government of Indonesia as one of Indonesia

’s

vital
      national assets. This designation results in the military

’s

playing
      a significant role in protecting the area of our operations. The Government
      of
      Indonesia is responsible for employing police and military personnel and
      directing their operations.

From
      the
      outset of PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

operations, the government has looked to PT Freeport Indonesia to provide
      logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary
      services because of the limited resources of the Indonesian government and
      the
      remote location of and lack of development in Papua. PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

financial support for the Indonesian government security institutions assigned
      to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to
      protect its workforce and property, better ensuring that personnel are properly
      fed and lodged, and have the logistical resources to patrol PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

roads
      and secure its operating area. In addition, provision of such support and
      oversight is consistent with PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

obligations under the Contract of Work, reflects our philosophy of responsible
      corporate citizenship, and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices
      that will promote human rights, which include our endorsement of the joint
      U.S.
      State Department-British Foreign Office Voluntary Principles on Human Rights
      and
      Security.

PT
      Freeport Indonesia

’s

share of
      support costs for the government-provided security, involving over 2,625
      Indonesian government security personnel currently located in the general area
      of our operations, was $8.5 million for 2006, $6.2 million for 2005 and $6.9
      million for 2004. This supplemental support consists of various infrastructure
      and other costs, such as food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs,
      allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs, and community
      assistance programs conducted by the military/police. PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

capital
      costs for associated infrastructure was $0.1 million for 2006, $0.1 million
      for
      2005 and $0.2 million for 2004.

As
      reported in January 2006, we are responding to requests from governmental
      authorities in United States and Indonesia for information about PT Freeport
      Indonesia primarily relating to PT Freeport Indonesia’s support of Indonesian
      security institutions. As discussed above, we provide support to assist security
      institutions deployed and directed by the Government of Indonesia with
      infrastructure, logistics and the hardship elements of posting in Papua and
      our
      practices adhere to the joint U.S. State Department-British Foreign Office
      Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.

We
      are
      cooperating with these requests.

Environmental
      Matters

We
      have a
      board-approved environmental policy that commits us not only to compliance
      with
      applicable federal, state and local environmental statutes and regulations,
      but
      also to continuous improvement of our environmental performance at every
      operational site. We believe that we conduct our Indonesian operations pursuant
      to all necessary permits and are in compliance in all material respects with
      applicable Indonesian environmental laws, rules and regulations. Additionally,
      the environmental management systems for our PT Freeport Indonesia mining and
      milling operations and our Atlantic Copper smelting operations are ISO
      (International Standardization Organization) 14001 certified.



Mining
      operations on the scale of our operations in Papua involve significant
      environmental challenges, primarily related to the disposition of tailings,
      which are the crushed and ground rock material resulting from the physical
      separation of commercially valuable minerals from the ore. We have
      comprehensive, ongoing environmental management and monitoring plans for the
      disposal of tailings resulting from our milling operations, which the Government
      of Indonesia has approved. Pursuant to these plans, we manage and monitor the
      impact of our tailings disposal on the surrounding area of the Ajkwa River
      and
      adjoining water bodies and the surrounding coastal areas. In 1997, we completed
      an engineered levee system to minimize the impact of the tailings through a
      controlled deposition area located on a portion of the flood plain on the Ajkwa
      River.

In
      furtherance of our commitments to the Indonesian government pursuant to our
      tailings management plan, we monitor the acid-neutralizing capacity of tailings
      on a daily basis to ensure the discharge of non-acid generating tailings into
      our tailings deposition area. The net acid-neutralizing capacity of our tailings
      discharge is maintained through a managed program of blending underground ore
      with ore from the open pit, the addition of supplemental limestone (or lime)
      to
      the ore blend, and the addition of lime for control of the pH levels in the
      flotation system. Daily samples are collected and tested and this data is
      communicated to our mill operations so that appropriate adjustments in ore
      blending and lime/limestone addition can be made.

With
      respect to overburden, control and treatment of acid rock drainage is our
      primary environmental issue. Our approaches to this issue include the prevention
      of acid rock drainage generation, the control of acid rock drainage migration,
      and the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage emanating from the
      overburden stockpile. In addition, tests have shown the feasibility of
      revegetating the overburden stockpile and, as a result, we have engaged in
      stockpile reclamation as an additional means of mitigating acid rock
      drainage.

We
      have
      made significant capital expenditures with respect to the capture and treatment
      of acid rock drainage. We continue to evaluate various technologies for the
      treatment of captured acid rock drainage. Currently, acid rock drainage
      collected by boreholes at the base of the overburden stockpile is treated using
      conventional lime neutralization.

We
      have
      also committed to the Indonesian government to have independent external
      environmental audits of our Papuan operations performed by qualified experts
      every three years, with results available for public review. We have had four
      independent environmental audits conducted by internationally recognized
      consulting and auditing firms. Audits were completed in 1996 by Dames &
Moore; in 1999 by Montgomery Watson; in 2002 by SGS International Certification
      Services Indonesia, a member of the Société Générale de Surveillance group; and
      in 2005 by Montgomery Watson Harza. Montgomery Watson Harza concluded that
      PT
      Freeport Indonesia’s mining operations “are among the largest and most
      environmentally challenging and complex in the world” and that the company’s
“environmental management practices continue to be based on (and in some cases
      represent) best management practices for the international copper and gold
      mining industry.” The audit also concluded, as have previous independent audits,
      that PT Freeport Indonesia’s tailings management program “remains the tailings
      management option best suited to the unique topographical and climatological
      conditions of the site, with a far lower level of environmental impact and
      risk”
than those posed by alternatives. The Montgomery Watson Harza auditors also
      made
      a number of specific recommendations for improvements in PT Freeport Indonesia’s
      environmental management practices and these are being implemented. We also
      conduct annual internal audits to ensure that our environmental management
      and
      monitoring programs remain sound and our operations will continue to comply
      in
      all material respects with applicable regulations.

In
      addition to these audits, PT Freeport Indonesia agreed to participate in the
      Government of Indonesia’s PROPER program in 2005. In March 2006, the Indonesian
      Ministry of Environment announced the preliminary results of its PROPER
      environmental management audit, acknowledging the effectiveness of PT Freeport
      Indonesia’s environmental management practices in some areas while making
      several suggestions for improvement in others. We are working with the Ministry
      of Environment to address the issues raised as we complete the audit
      process.

In
      connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the Indonesian
      government, we committed to performing a one-time environmental risk assessment
      on the impacts of our tailings management plan. We completed this extensive
      environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted
      over four years and submitted it to the Indonesian government in December 2002.
      We developed the risk assessment exercise with input from an independent review
      panel, which included representatives from the Indonesian government, academia,
      and non-governmental organizations. The risks that we identified during this
      process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management
      program contained in our environmental approval documents.



We
      have
      environmental approvals from the Government of Indonesia to expand our milling
      rate up to a maximum of 300,000 metric tons of ore per day. In 2006, we averaged
      229,400 metric tons of ore per day and in 2005 we averaged 216,200 metric tons
      of ore per day.

The
      cost
      of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental cost of our business.
      We
      incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental
      costs totaling $62.7 million in 2006, $44.0 million in 2005 and $65.1 million
      in
      2004, including tailings management levee maintenance and mine reclamation.
      In
      2007, we expect to incur approximately $43 million of aggregate environmental
      capital expenditures and $55 million of other environmental costs.

We
      are
      currently revegetating portions of the tailings deposition area. Upon the
      completion of our mining operations, we will fulfill the commitments included
      in
      our approved environmental management plans. Our plans for revegetation of
      affected areas of the deposition area include natural revegetation, forage
      crops
      and grasses, fruits, grains and vegetables, and other traditional food and
      medicinal crops. Decisions on these plans are made in consultation with local
      and regional government, local residents and other stakeholders. In addition
      to
      the revegetation and reclamation of the deposition area, we will continue to
      operate treatment systems as long as necessary. We also monitor and test the
      water discharged from our mine and the pH, sulfate and electrical conductivity
      levels of ground water in the deposition area. The stability of our levees
      will
      be ensured through comprehensive visual inspection, maintenance and improvement
      programs directed by an experienced engineering group dedicated to levee
      management and revegetation of the levee embankments. Moreover, we will submit
      an annual written report to the Indonesian government regarding our reclamation
      activities.

Our
      ultimate reclamation and closure activities will be determined after
      consultation with the Indonesian government, local residents and other parties.
      Our estimate as of December 31, 2006 of PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

total
      aggregate reclamation and closure obligations total approximately $157 million.
      Estimates of reclamation and closure costs involve complex issues requiring
      integrated assessments over a period of many years, and we may revise them
      as we
      perform more complete studies. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during
      mining activities, while most closure costs and the remaining reclamation costs
      will be incurred at the end of mining activities, which are currently estimated
      to continue for more than 34 years.

Moreover,
      we cannot predict with any certainty the ultimate future uses of the tailings
      deposition area once our mining operations are completed. In addition to forage
      crop and grass planting and food and medicinal crop production, possible future
      uses of the tailings deposition area include rainforest regrowth, production
      of
      timber, fuel woods, fruits and nuts and other economic forestry, and the
      cultivation of fish, shellfish and other aquaculture. The ultimate future uses
      will be determined in consultation with local and regional government, local
      residents and other stakeholders.

In
      1996,
      we began contributing to a cash fund ($8.5 million balance at December 31,
      2006)
      designed to accumulate at least $100 million by the end of our Indonesian mining
      activities. We plan to use this fund, including accrued interest, to pay for
      mine closure and reclamation costs. Any incremental costs in excess of this
      $100
      million fund are expected to be incurred throughout the life of the mine and
      would be funded by operational cash flow or other sources. Future environmental
      considerations and future changes in regulations could require us to incur
      additional costs that would be charged against future operations. Estimates
      involving environmental matters are by their nature imprecise and changes in
      government regulations, operations, technology and inflation can be expected
      to
      require us to revise them over time.

We
      believe that Atlantic Copper

’s

facilities and operations are in compliance in all material respects with all
      currently applicable Spanish environmental laws, rules and regulations. In
      July
      2002, the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control guidelines were adopted
      under Spanish law with a phase in for compliance by 2009. Atlantic Copper,
      working with local environmental authorities, is continually assessing the
      impact of these new guidelines on its operations, and has budgeted approximately
      $27 million as its estimate of the remaining required capital expenditures
      from
      2007 through 2010 to comply. In April 2006, the Environmental Management Systems
      at Atlantic Copper’s operations in Huelva were audited by the Spanish
      Association for Standardization and Certification (AENOR), in accordance with
      the ISO 14001:96 international certification standards and the European Union
      Environmental, Eco-Management and Eco-Auditing (EMAS) Regulation No. 761/2001.
      AENOR is a Spanish not-for-profit entity that has been accredited by the Spanish
      government to inspect, audit and certify environmental management systems.
      Atlantic Copper received positive results from the audits, which are required
      annually to retain the ISO 14001 certification that Atlantic Copper achieved
      in
      prior years.



The
      Indonesian and Spanish governments may periodically revise their environmental
      laws and regulations or adopt new ones, and we cannot predict the effects on
      our
      operations of new or revised regulations. We have expended significant
      resources, both financial and managerial, to comply with environmental
      regulations and permitting and approval requirements, and we anticipate that
      we
      will continue to do so in the future. There can be no assurance that we will
      not
      incur additional significant costs and liabilities to comply with such current
      and future regulations or that such regulations will not materially affect
      our
      operations (see “Risk Factors”).

Employees
      and Relationship with FM Services Company

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, PT Freeport Indonesia had 8,957 employees (approximately
      percent Indonesian) and 6,141 contract workers, the vast majority of whom were
      Indonesian. Approximately 74 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

employees are represented by the All Indonesia Workers’ Union, which operates
      under Government of Indonesia supervision. PT Freeport Indonesia has a labor
      agreement covering its hourly paid Indonesian employees, the key provisions
      of
      which are renegotiated biannually. In June 2005, PT Freeport Indonesia and
      its
      workers agreed to terms for a new labor agreement that expires in September
      2007. PT Freeport Indonesia’s relations with the workers’ union have generally
      been satisfactory. In addition, 4,579 persons worked for privatized companies
      providing services within PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

operations area.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, Atlantic Copper had 550 employees, of which approximately
      percent are represented by union contracts. Atlantic Copper’s labor contract
      covering its smelter/refinery workforce in Huelva, Spain expired on December
      31,
      2005, and was renewed for a three-year period with no material changes in terms.
      Atlantic Copper experienced a four-day labor strike in October 2004 at its
      smelter facility in Huelva because of a workforce reduction plan. The union’s
      issues with the workforce reduction plan were resolved and the plan was approved
      by Spanish authorities and implemented in December 2004.

FM
      Services Company (FM Services) furnishes executive, administrative, financial,
      accounting, legal, tax and similar services to us. FM Services became our wholly
      owned subsidiary in October 2002, when we purchased the remaining 50 percent
      ownership in FM Services from McMoRan Exploration Co. (McMoRan) for $1.3
      million. As of December 31, 2006, FCX had 9 employees and FM Services had 145
      employees. FM Services employees continue to also provide services to McMoRan,
      a
      publicly traded company engaged in the exploration, development and production
      of oil and gas, and Stratus Properties Inc., a publicly traded company engaged
      in the development of real estate.

Item
      1A. Risk Factors

This
      report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal
      securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than
      statements of historical facts, such as statements regarding anticipated
      production volumes, unit net cash costs, sales volumes, ore grades, commodity
      prices, development and capital expenditures, mine production and development
      plans, environmental reclamation and closure cost and plans, reserve estimates,
      political, economic and social conditions in our areas of operations,
      exploration efforts and results, and the proposed acquisition of Phelps Dodge.
      Except for our ongoing obligations under the federal securities laws, we do
      not
      intend, and we undertake no obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking
      statements. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not
      guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from
      those projected, anticipated or assumed in the forward-looking statements.
      Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially
      from
      those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the
      following:

Because
      our primary operating assets are located in the Republic of Indonesia, our
      business may be adversely affected by Indonesian political, economic and social
      uncertainties, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting
      business in a foreign country.

Indonesia
      has faced political, economic and social uncertainties, including separatist
      movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. In
      particular, several separatist groups are opposing Indonesian rule over the
      province of Papua, where our mining operations are located, and have sought
      political independence for the province. In response to demands for political
      independence, new Indonesian regional autonomy laws became effective January
      1,
      2001. However, the manner in which the new laws are being implemented and the
      degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual
      provinces, including Papua, are uncertain and are ongoing issues in Indonesian
      politics. Moreover, in Papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians
      by


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

separatists
      and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the
      Indonesian military. Social, economic and political instability in Papua could
      materially and adversely affect us if this instability results in damage to
      our
      property or interruption of our activities.

Maintaining
      a good working relationship with the Indonesian government is important to
      us
      because all of our mining operations are located in Indonesia and are conducted
      pursuant to Contracts of Work with the Indonesian government. Accordingly,
      we
      are also subject to the usual risks associated with conducting business in
      and
      with a foreign country, including the risk of forced modification of existing
      contracts, changes in the country

’s

laws and
      policies, including those relating to taxation, royalties, divestment, imports,
      exports and currency, and the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction
      of a
      foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a
      foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own
      territory. In addition, we are subject to the risk of expropriation, and our
      insurance does not cover losses caused by expropriation.

In
      February 2006, a group of illegal gold panners engaged in conflict with
      Indonesian police and PT Freeport Indonesia security personnel when they were
      requested to leave an area near our milling facilities. Following the incident,
      the illegal panners blocked the road leading to the Grasberg mine and mill
      in
      protest and we temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a
      precautionary measure. The panners also vandalized some of our light vehicles
      and offices near this area, causing approximately $2 million in damages. Our
      port facilities continued to operate during the disruption and concentrate
      shipments were not affected. The panners, mostly Papuans from outside our area
      of operations, presented a list of aspirations, primarily relating to their
      desire to share in the benefits of our existing initiatives and programs
      provided for the Papuans who are the traditional residents of our operations
      area. Mining and milling operations resumed after an approximate four-day
      outage. During the incident at our mine and mill, protestors in Jakarta
      vandalized the entrance floor of the office building housing our Indonesian
      headquarters and staged a three-day rally outside the building. The Indonesian
      police handled this matter, which did not disrupt our administrative functions
      or damage any of our facilities.

We
      cannot
      predict if there will be additional incidents similar to the February 2006
      protests or other incidents that could disrupt our operations. If there were
      additional protests at our mine and mill facilities, it could materially and
      adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict
      at this time.

In
      addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, we face
      additional risks because our operations are located on difficult terrain in
      a
      very remote area.

Our
      mining operations are located in steeply mountainous terrain in a very remote
      area in Indonesia. Because of these conditions, we have had to overcome special
      engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. In
      addition, the area receives considerable rainfall, which has led to periodic
      floods and mudslides. The mine site is also in an active seismic area and has
      experienced earth tremors from time to time. In addition to these special risks,
      we are also subject to the usual risks associated with the mining industry,
      such
      as the risk of encountering unexpected geological conditions that may result
      in
      cave-ins and flooding of mine areas. Our insurance may not sufficiently cover
      an
      unexpected natural or operating disaster.

On
      October 9, 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a section of the Grasberg
      open pit, resulting in eight fatalities. On December 12, 2003, a debris flow
      involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same
      section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage. All material
      involved in the affected mining areas was removed. The events caused us to
      alter
      our short-term mine sequencing plans, which adversely affected our 2003 and
      production. While we resumed normal production activities in the second quarter
      of 2004, no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the
      future.

On
      March
      23, 2006, a mud/topsoil slide involving approximately 75,000 metric tons of
      material occurred from a mountain ridge above service facilities supporting
      PT
      Freeport Indonesia’s mining facilities. Regrettably, three contract workers were
      fatally injured in the event. The material damaged a mess hall and an adjacent
      area. As a result of investigations by PT Freeport Indonesia and the Indonesian
      Department of Energy and Mineral Resources, we conducted geotechnical studies
      to
      identify any potential hazards to facilities from slides. The existing early
      warning system for potential slides, based upon rainfall and other factors,
      has
      also been expanded. PT Freeport Indonesia recorded a charge of $1.9 million
      ($1.0 million to net income or less than $0.01 per diluted share) in the first
      quarter of 2006 for damages related to this event. The event did not directly
      involve operations within the Grasberg open-pit mine or PT Freeport Indonesia’s
      milling operations.



The
      terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, subsequent attacks
      in Indonesia and the potential for additional future terrorist acts and other
      recent events have created economic and political uncertainties that could
      materially and adversely affect our business and the prices of our
      securities.

On
      August
      31, 2002, three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush
      by a
      group of assailants. The assailants shot at several vehicles transporting
      international contract teachers from our school in Tembagapura, their family
      members, and other contractors to PT Freeport Indonesia on the road near
      Tembagapura, the mining town where the majority of PT Freeport
      Indonesia

’s

personnel reside. We, along with the U.S. government, the central Indonesian
      government, the Papuan provincial and local governments, and leaders of the
      local people residing in the area of our operations condemned the attack.
      Indonesian authorities and the U.S. FBI investigated the incident, which
      resulted in the U.S. indictment of an alleged operational commander of the
      Free
      Papua Movement/National Freedom Force. In January 2006, Indonesian Police,
      accompanied by FBI agents, arrested the alleged operational commander in the
      Free Papua Movement/National Freedom Force and 11 other Papuans. In November
      2006, verdicts and sentencing were announced for seven of the accused in the
      August 2002 shooting, including a life sentence for the confessed leader of
      the
      attack.

On
      October 12, 2002, a bombing killed 202 people in the Indonesian province of
      Bali, which is 1,500 miles west of our mining and milling operations. Indonesian
      authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those
      arrested have been tried and convicted. On August 5, 2003, 12 people were killed
      and over 100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the JW
      Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. On September 9, 2004, 11 people were
      killed and over 200 others injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the
      Australian embassy in Jakarta. On October 1, 2005, three suicide bombers killed
      19 people and wounded over 100 others in Bali. The same international terrorist
      organizations are suspected in each of these incidents. In November 2005,
      Indonesian Police raided a house in East Java that resulted in the death of
      other accused terrorists linked to the bombings discussed above. Our mining
      and
      milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but our corporate
      office in Jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing
      in
      front of the Australian embassy.

We
      cannot
      predict whether there will be additional incidents similar to the recent
      shooting or bombings. If there were to be additional separatist, terrorist
      or
      other violence in Indonesia, it could materially and adversely affect our
      business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this
      time.

Terrorist
      attacks and other events have caused uncertainty in the world

’s

financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase global political,
      economic and social instability, including in Indonesia. In addition to the
      Bali, JW Marriott Hotel and Australian embassy bombings, there have been
      anti-American demonstrations in certain sections of Indonesia reportedly led
      by
      radical Islamic activists. Radical activists have also threatened to attack
      foreign interests and have called for the expulsion of U.S. and British citizens
      and companies from Indonesia.

It
      is
      possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the U.S.
      domestically or abroad, and such acts could be directed against properties
      and
      personnel of companies such as ours. The attacks and the resulting economic
      and
      political uncertainties, including the potential for further terrorist acts,
      have negatively impacted insurance markets. Moreover, while our property and
      business interruption insurance covers damages to insured property directly
      caused by terrorism, this insurance does not cover damages and losses caused
      by
      war. Terrorism and war developments may materially and adversely affect our
      business and profitability and the prices of our securities in ways that we
      cannot predict at this time.

Our
      profitability can vary significantly with fluctuations in the market prices
      of
      copper and gold.

Our
      revenues are derived primarily from the sale of copper concentrates, which
      also
      contain significant quantities of gold and silver, and from the sale of copper
      cathodes and anodes. Although we sell most of our copper concentrates under
      long-term contracts, the selling price is based on world metal prices at or
      near
      the time of shipment and delivery.

During
      2006, the daily closing prices on the London spot market ranged from $2.06
      to
      $3.99 per pound for copper and $521 to $726 per ounce for gold. During 2005,
      the
      daily closing prices on the London spot market ranged from $1.39 to $2.11 per
      pound for copper and $411 to $538 per ounce for gold.

World
      copper prices have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous
      factors beyond our control, including:

Contracts of Work and other Contracts of Work in which we have an interest
      were
      entered into under Indonesia

’s

      Foreign Capital Investment Law, which provides guarantees of remittance rights
      and protection against nationalization. Our Contracts of Work can be terminated

      which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the
      satisfaction of certain mining, environmental, safety and health

At
      times,
      certain government officials and others in Indonesia have questioned the
      validity of contracts entered into by the Government of Indonesia prior to
      May
      1998 (i.e., during the Suharto regime which lasted over 30 years), including
      PT
      Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work, which was signed in December 1991. We
      cannot assure you that the validity of, or their compliance with, the Contracts
      of Work will not be challenged for political or other reasons. PT Freeport
      Indonesia’s Contract of Work and our other Contracts of Work require that
      disputes with the Indonesian government be submitted to international
      arbitration. Notwithstanding that provision, if a dispute arises under the
      Contracts of Work, we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction
      of a
      foreign court or arbitration panel, and if we prevail in such a dispute, we
      will
      face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court
      or
      arbitration panel against Indonesia within its own territory.



Indonesian
      government officials have periodically undertaken reviews regarding our
      compliance with Indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms
      of
      the Contracts of Work. In 2006, the Government of Indonesia created a joint
      team
      for “Periodic Evaluation on Implementation of the PT-FI Contract of Work (COW)”
to conduct a periodic evaluation every five years. The team consists of five
      working groups, whose members are from relevant ministries or agencies, covering
      production, state revenues, community development, environmental issues and
      security issues. We have conducted numerous working meetings with these groups.
      While we believe that we comply with the Contract of Work in all material
      respects, we cannot assure you that the report will conclude that we are
      complying with all of the provisions of PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of
      Work. Separately, the Indonesian House of Representatives created a working
      committee on PT Freeport Indonesia. Members of this group have also visited
      our
      operations and held a number of hearings in Jakarta. We will continue to work
      with these groups to respond to their questions about our operations and our
      compliance with PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work.

Any
      suspension of required activities under our Contracts of Work requires the
      consent of the Indonesian government.

Our
      Contracts of Work permit us to suspend certain contractually required
      activities, including exploration, for a period of one year by making a written
      request to the Indonesian government. These requests are subject to the approval
      of the Indonesian government and are renewable annually. If we do not request
      a
      suspension or are denied a suspension, then we are required to continue our
      activities under the Contract of Work or potentially be declared in default.
      Moreover, if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other
      than force majeure and the Indonesian government has not approved such
      continuation, then the government would be entitled to declare a default under
      the Contract of Work.

We
      suspended our field exploration activities outside of Block A in recent years
      because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to
      a
      possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest
      areas and an Indonesian Forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining
      in forest preservation areas. In 2001, we requested and received from the
      Government of Indonesia, formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under
      the Contracts of Work in all areas outside of Block A. Recent Indonesian
      legislation permits open-pit mining in PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

Block B
      area, subject to certain requirements. Following an assessment of these
      requirements and a review of security issues, we plan to resume exploration
      activities in certain prospective Contract of Work areas outside of Block A
      in
      2007.

Our
      mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and
      future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts
      from our operations, could require us to incur increased
      costs.

Mining
      operations on the scale of our operations in Papua involve significant
      environmental risks and challenges. Our primary challenge is to dispose of
      the
      large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called tailings, that results
      from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and
      silver-bearing materials from the ore that we mine. Our tailings management
      plan
      uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to the lowlands
      where the tailings and natural sediments are deposited in a controlled area
      contained within a levee system that will be revegetated. We incurred aggregate
      costs relating to tailings management of $12.8 million in 2006, $8.7 million
      in
      2005 and $11.8 million in 2004.

Another
      major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that
      must be moved aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore. In the
      presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can
      cause acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals which,
      if
      not properly managed, can have a negative impact on the
      environment.

Certain
      Indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised issues with
      respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion
      that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river deposition system
      for
      tailings disposal. Because our mining operations are remotely located in steep
      mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would
      be
      costly, difficult to construct and maintain, more prone to catastrophic failure
      and involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. An external
      panel of qualified experts, as directed in our 300K ANDAL (the Environmental
      Impact Assessment document submitted to the Indonesian government and approved
      in 1997), conducted detailed reviews and analyses of a number of technical
      studies. They concluded that all significant impacts identified were in line
      with the 300K ANDAL


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

predictions,
      and that the current system of riverine tailings management was appropriate
      considering all site-specific factors. For these reasons, we do not believe
      that
      a pipeline system is necessary or practical.

In
      March
      2006, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment announced the preliminary results
      of its PROPER environmental management audit, acknowledging the effectiveness
      of
      PT Freeport Indonesia’s environmental management practices in some areas while
      making several suggestions for improvement in others. We are working with the
      Ministry of Environment to address the issues raised as it completes the audit
      process.

We
      anticipate that we will continue to spend significant financial and managerial
      resources on environmental compliance. In addition, changes in Indonesian
      environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations
      could require us to incur significant unanticipated costs.

The
      volume and grade of the reserves we recover and our rates of production may
      be
      more or less than we anticipate.

Our
      reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry
      practices and standards, but are estimates of the mineral deposits that can
      be
      recovered economically and legally based on currently available data. Our ore
      bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations, and estimates may
      change as new data become available. Because ore bodies do not contain uniform
      grades of minerals, our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time, which
      will result in variations in the volumes of minerals that we can sell from
      period to period. Some of our reserves may become unprofitable to develop if
      there are unfavorable long-term market price fluctuations in copper and gold,
      or
      if there are significant increases in our operating or capital costs. In
      addition, our exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional
      mineral deposits that we can mine profitably.

We
      do not expect to mine all of our reserves before the initial term of our
      Contract of Work expires.

All
      of
      our current proven and probable reserves, including the Grasberg deposit, are
      located in Block A. The initial term of our Contract of Work covering these
      reserves expires at the end of 2021. We can extend this term for two successive
      10-year periods, subject to the approval of the Indonesian government, which
      under our Contract of Work cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. Our
      reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end
      of
      2041 (

i.e

.,
      through the expiration of the two 10-year extensions) and our current mine
      plan
      has been developed, and our operations are based on the assumption that we
      will
      receive the two 10-year extensions. As a result, we will not mine all of our
      reserves during the current term of our Contract of Work, and there can be
      no
      assurance that the Indonesian government will approve the extensions. Prior
      to
      the end of 2021, we expect to mine approximately 39 percent of aggregate proven
      and probable recoverable ore at December 31, 2006, representing approximately
      percent of PT Freeport Indonesia

’s

share of
      recoverable copper reserves and approximately 59 percent of its share of
      recoverable gold reserves.

Increased
      energy and other production costs could reduce our profitability and cash
      flow.

We
      have
      experienced significant increases in our production costs in recent years
      primarily as a result of higher energy costs and costs of other consumables,
      higher mining costs and milling rates and higher labor costs. Aggregate energy
      costs, which approximated 22 percent of our 2006 production costs, primarily
      include purchases of diesel fuel and coal. Diesel prices have nearly tripled
      since 2002 and our coal costs are approximately 40 percent higher. The costs
      of
      other consumables, including steel and reagents, also have increased. Continued
      increases in the cost of diesel, coal and other commodities that we consume
      or
      use in our operations could adversely affect our profits and cash
      flow.

Our
      business is subject to operational risks.

Mines
      by
      their nature are subject to many operational risks and factors that are
      generally outside of our control and could impact its business, operating
      results and cash flows. These operational risks and factors include, but are
      not
      limited to:

·

unanticipated
                ground and water conditions and adverse claims to water
                rights;

·

geological
                problems, including earthquakes and other natural
                disasters;


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

·

metallurgical
                and other processing problems;

·

the
                occurrence of unusual weather or operating conditions and other force
                majeure events;

·

lower
                than expected ore grades or recovery
                rates;

·

accidents;

·

delays
                in the receipt of or failure to receive necessary government
                permits;

·

the
                results of litigation, including appeals of agency
                decisions;

·

uncertainty
                of exploration and development;

·

delays
                in transportation;

·

labor
                disputes;

·

inability
                to obtain satisfactory insurance
                coverage;

·

unavailability
                of materials and equipment; and

·

the
                failure of equipment or processes to operate in accordance with
                specifications or expectations.

Movements
      in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could negatively affect
      our
      operating results.

All
      of
      our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in U.S.
      dollars; however, some costs, and certain asset and liability accounts are
      denominated in Indonesian rupiah, Australian dollars or euros. As a result,
      we
      are generally less profitable when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to these
      foreign currencies.

The
      rupiah/U.S. dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 8,613 to 9,881 rupiah
      per U.S. dollar during 2006, and on December 29, 2006, the closing exchange
      rate
      was 8,989 rupiah per U.S. dollar compared with 9,825 rupiah per U.S. dollar
      on
      December 30, 2005. During 2006, the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar daily closing
      exchange rate ranged from $0.70 to $0.79 per Australian dollar and the euro/U.S.
      dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from $1.18 to $1.34 per euro. On
      December 29, 2006, the closing exchange rates were $0.79 per Australian dollar
      and $1.32 per euro, compared with the December 30, 2005 closing exchange rates
      of $0.73 per Australian dollar and $1.18 per euro.

From
      time
      to time, we have in the past and may in the future implement currency hedges
      intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
      However, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged
      foreign exchange payment requirements will continue to be subject to market
      fluctuations. In addition, our bank credit facilities are based on fluctuating
      interest rates. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates could adversely
      affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Because
      we are a holding company, our ability to pay our debts depends upon the ability
      of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends and to advance us funds. In addition,
      our ability to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets is
      generally subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’
creditors.

Because
      we conduct business primarily through PT Freeport Indonesia, our major
      subsidiary, and other subsidiaries, our ability to pay our debts depends upon
      the earnings and cash flow of PT Freeport Indonesia and our other subsidiaries
      and their ability to pay us dividends and to advance us funds. Contractual
      and
      legal restrictions applicable to our subsidiaries could also limit our ability
      to obtain cash from them. Our rights to participate in any distribution of
      our
      subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would
      generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors,
      including any trade creditors and preferred shareholders.



Risk
      Factors Associated with the Proposed Acquisition of Phelps
      Dodge.

Shareholders
      cannot be sure of the market value of our shares that will be issued in the
      transaction.

Upon
      the
      completion of the transaction, each Phelps Dodge common share outstanding
      immediately prior to the transaction will be converted into the right to receive
      a combination of 0.67 of a share of our common stock and $88.00 in cash, without
      interest. Because the exchange ratio for the stock consideration is fixed in
      the
      merger agreement, the market value of our common stock issued in the transaction
      will depend upon the market price of a share of our common stock upon the
      completion of the transaction. This market value will fluctuate prior to the
      completion of the transaction and therefore may be different at the time the
      transaction is completed from what it was at the time the merger agreement
      was
      signed, the date of this document or at the time of the shareholder meetings.
      Accordingly, shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of our common
      stock
      that will be issued in the transaction or the market value of our common stock
      at any time after the transaction.

We
      may not be able to obtain the financing needed for the transaction on favorable
      terms.

We
      have
      received commitments from certain lenders to provide financing of up to $17.5
      billion in the aggregate for the transaction. However, if the proceeds of this
      financing are unavailable for any reason, we will be forced to obtain an
      alternate source of financing, which may be more expensive for us, may have
      an
      adverse impact on the combined company’s capital structure or may be
      unavailable.

The
      combined company will be highly leveraged, and its high level of debt may limit
      its financial and operating flexibility.

We
      will
      be incurring significant debt to consummate the transaction and to refinance
      existing debt. It is expected that we will utilize much of the financing to
      be
      made available pursuant to the financing commitments discussed above to fund
      a
      portion of the cash consideration payable to the Phelps Dodge shareholders
      in
      the transaction. The combined company, on a pro forma basis, will have
      approximately $10.0 billion of debt under its new senior secured term credit
      facilities, and either $6.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of new
      unsecured senior notes or a $6.0 billion bridge loan (or some combination of
      the
      two). In addition, approximately $1.6 billion of existing debt of the combined
      companies will remain outstanding following the transaction. The combined
      company is also expected to have a new $1.5 billion senior secured revolving
      credit facility with at least $1.0 billion of availability.

This
      debt
      could limit the combined company’s financial and operating flexibility,
      including by requiring the combined company to dedicate a substantial portion
      of
      its cash flows from operations and the proceeds of equity issuances to the
      repayment of its debt and making the combined company more vulnerable to
      economic downturns. Additionally, the combined company’s ability to satisfy
      financial tests or utilize third-party guarantees for financial assurance with
      respect to reclamation obligations may be adversely impacted as a result of
      the
      increase in debt.

Upon
      consummation of the transaction, we and all of our restricted subsidiaries
      must
      comply with various covenants contained in our credit agreement. These covenants
      will, among other things, limit the ability of the respective restricted
      entities to:

·

incur
                additional debt or liens or enter into sale/leaseback
                transactions;

·

make
                payments in respect of, or redeem or acquire, debt or equity issued
                by us,
                including the payment of dividends on common
                stock;

·

sell
                assets or enter into mergers or
                acquisitions;

·

make
                loans or investments; or

·

enter
                into certain hedging transactions.

In
      addition, the combined company will be subject to financial
      covenants.


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

Declines
      in the market prices of copper, gold and molybdenum could adversely affect
      the
      combined company’s earnings and cash flows, and therefore its ability to repay
      its debt.

The
      earnings and cash flows of the combined company will be affected significantly
      by the market prices of copper and, to a lesser extent, gold and molybdenum.
      The
      world market prices of these commodities have fluctuated historically and will
      be affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the combined company.
      Many
      financial analysts who follow the metals markets are predicting that copper
      prices will decline significantly from their current, historically high, levels
      over the next few years. A decline in the world market price of one or more
      of
      these commodities could adversely affect the combined company’s earnings and
      cash flows and therefore could adversely affect its ability to repay its debt
      and depress its stock price.

The
      combined company will operate on a broader geographical scope than either we
      or
      Phelps Dodge has operated individually, and will be exposed to a broader range
      of political, social and geographic risks than either company has been exposed
      to on an individual basis.

Phelps
      Dodge conducts mining operations in the United States, Chile and Peru and has
      a
      significant development project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (which
      is expected to begin production by 2009). Accordingly, the business of the
      combined company may be adversely affected by political, economic and social
      uncertainties in these countries, in addition to the usual risks associated
      with
      conducting business in a foreign country. Because we have no significant
      operations in any of these countries, these risks are different from and in
      addition to those to which our business has historically been
      exposed.

In
      addition, all of the combined company’s revenues and a significant portion of
      its costs will be denominated in U.S. dollars; however, some of its costs,
      and
      certain of its asset and liability accounts, will be denominated in Indonesian
      rupiah, Chilean pesos, Peruvian nuevos soles and other foreign currencies.
      As a
      result, the combined company will be generally less profitable when the U.S.
      dollar weakens in relation to these foreign currencies. From time to time,
      the
      combined company may implement currency hedges intended to reduce its exposure
      to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, its hedging strategies
      may not be successful, and any of its unhedged foreign exchange payments will
      continue to be subject to market fluctuations.

The
      impact of purchase accounting could adversely affect the combined company’s
      earnings.

Purchase
      accounting will require the combined company to allocate the price being paid
      in
      the transaction to Phelps Dodge’s assets on the basis of their fair values at
      the time of the closing of the transaction. Those adjustments are expected
      to
      result in significant increases in the carrying values of certain acquired
      assets, including, based on preliminary estimates, increases of $4.0 billion
      in
      metal inventories and stockpiles and $11.9 billion in property, plant, equipment
      and development costs, as reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed
      combined balance sheet contained in Amendment No. 2 to our Form S-4 filed with
      the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2007. The increased
      value
      of property, plant, equipment and development costs will increase the combined
      company’s depreciation expense, which will reduce reported earnings but have no
      effect on cash flows.

A
      decline
      in the market price of commodities produced by the combined company could result
      in a write down of metal inventories and stockpiles to recoverable values and
      the recognition of impairment charges to property, plant, equipment and
      development costs. In addition, the increased value of metal inventories and
      stockpiles would cause the combined company’s cost of goods sold to increase in
      the year the metal in those inventories and stockpiles are recognized as sold.
      If the combined company changes the historical method of accounting for Phelps
      Dodge’s metal inventories and stockpiles from the current method of last-in,
      first-out, this increase in the combined company’s cost of goods would occur in
      the near term. These factors would have the effect of reducing reported
      earnings, although they would have no effect on cash flows.

In
      addition, the preliminary estimate of goodwill associated with the transaction
      is approximately $8.5 billion, as reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed
      combined balance sheet contained in Amendment No. 2 to our Form S-4 filed with
      the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2007. The combined
      company will annually assess this amount for impairment. If the combined company
      concludes that the goodwill associated with the transaction is impaired, the
      amount of the impairment would reduce the combined company’s reported earnings
      but would have no effect on cash flows.

We
      may
      experience difficulties in integrating our business with Phelps Dodge’s
      business, which could cause the combined company to fail to realize many of
      the
      anticipated potential benefits of the transaction.



We
      have
      entered into the merger agreement because we believe that the transaction will
      be beneficial to our company, Phelps Dodge and our respective shareholders.
      Achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction will depend in part upon
      whether our two companies integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective
      manner. We may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly
      or
      successfully. The difficulties of combining the two companies’ businesses
      potentially will include, among other things:

·

the
                necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations
                and
                addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management
                philosophies, and the integration of certain operations following
                the
                transaction will require the dedication of significant management
                resources, which may temporarily distract management’s attention from the
                day-to-day business of the combined
                company;

·

any
                inability of our management to integrate successfully the operations
                of
                our two companies or to adapt to the addition of lines of business
                in
                which we have not historically engaged;
                and

·

any
                inability of our management to cause best practices to be applied
                to the
                combined company’s businesses.

An
      inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the
      transaction, as well as any delays encountered in the transition process, could
      have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating
      results of the combined company, which may affect the value of our common stock
      after the closing of the transaction.

The
      combined company will depend on its senior management team and other key
      employees, and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect the
      combined company’s business.

The
      success of the combined company after the transaction will depend in part upon
      our ability to retain senior management and other key employees of both
      companies. Competition for qualified personnel can be very intense. In addition,
      senior management and key employees may depart because of issues relating to
      the
      uncertainty or difficulty associated with the integration of the companies
      or a
      desire not to remain with the combined company. Accordingly, no assurance can
      be
      given that we will be able to retain senior management and key employees to
      the
      same extent that they have been able to do so in the past.

Resales
      of shares of our common stock following the transaction and future issuances
      of
      equity or equity-linked securities by us may cause the market price of shares
      of
      our common stock to fall.

As
      of
      February 12, 2007, we had approximately 197 million shares of common stock
      outstanding, approximately 23 million shares authorized for issuance upon
      conversion of preferred stock and convertible notes, and approximately six
      million shares authorized for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options
      or the vesting of restricted stock units. We expect to issue approximately
      million shares of our common stock in connection with the transaction. The
      issuance of these new shares and the sale of additional shares that may become
      eligible for sale in the public market from time to time upon the exercise
      of
      options (including options that will replace existing Phelps Dodge options)
      could have the effect of depressing the market price for shares of our common
      stock. Also, because many Phelps Dodge shareholders are also our shareholders,
      some may decide to sell rather than hold the additional shares of our common
      stock they will receive in the transaction. The sale of those shares could
      also
      have the effect of depressing the market price for shares of our common
      stock.

Subject
      to market conditions, we intend to consider opportunities to reduce debt of
      the
      combined company shortly following the closing of the transaction through
      issuances of equity and equity-linked securities. The issuance of those
      securities could also have the effect of depressing the market price for the
      shares of our common stock.

The
      trading price of shares of our common stock following the transaction may be
      affected by factors different from those affecting the trading price of Phelps
      Dodge common shares and shares of our common stock prior to the
      transaction.

Following
      completion of the transaction, the results of operations of the combined
      company, as well as the trading price of our common stock, may be affected
      by
      factors different from those currently affecting Phelps Dodge’s results of
      operations and the trading price of Phelps Dodge common shares.


TABLE
      OF CONTENTS

In
      addition, the trading price of shares of our common stock following the
      transaction may be affected by factors different from those affecting the
      trading price of shares of our common stock prior to the transaction. Following
      the transaction, we will have significantly greater indebtedness and will derive
      a significantly smaller proportion of our revenues from gold. Current
      shareholders may decide to sell their shares as a result of those changes,
      which
      could have the effect of depressing the market price of shares of our common
      stock.

Item
      3. Legal Proceedings

.

We
      are
      involved from time to time in various legal proceedings of a character normally
      incident to the ordinary course of our business. We believe that potential
      liability in such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our
      financial condition or results of operations. We maintain liability insurance
      to
      cover some, but not all, potential liabilities normally incident to the ordinary
      course of our business as well as other insurance coverage customary in our
      business, with coverage limits that we deem prudent.

As
      reported in January 2006, we are responding to requests from governmental
      authorities in the United States and Indonesia for information about PT Freeport
      Indonesia, primarily relating to PT Freeport Indonesia’s support of Indonesian
      security institutions. As described elsewhere in this Form 10-K under the
      heading “Security Matters,” we provide support to assist security institutions
      deployed and directed by the Government of Indonesia with infrastructure,
      logistics and the hardship elements of posting in Papua and our practices adhere
      to the joint U.S. State Department-British Foreign Office Voluntary Principles
      on Security and Human Rights. We are cooperating with these
      requests.

The
      company has been named as a defendant in one of three actions brought on behalf
      of a purported class of all of the shareholders of Phelps Dodge Corporation.
      We
      have been named as a defendant in

Knisley
      v. Phelps Dodge Corp. et al., (No. CV2006-053422)

filed
      in
      the Superior Court of the state of Arizona, county of Maricopa. In all three
      class actions, the plaintiffs allege breaches of fiduciary duties by the Phelps
      Dodge board of directors in connection with the merger transaction. The
      complaints allege, among other things, that the named defendants engaged in
      self-dealing, obtained personal benefits for themselves not shared equally
      by
      Phelps Dodge shareholders and failed to disclose all material information
      concerning the transaction to Phelps Dodge shareholders. In

Knisley

,
      the
      plaintiffs also allege that we aided and abetted such alleged violations of
      fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief
      barring consummation of the transaction and directing that the defendants obtain
      a transaction which is in the best interests of Phelps Dodge shareholders.
      We,
      as well as Phelps Dodge and the other named defendants, believe the allegations
      are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions.

Common

In

      stock of $0.09 per share quarterly beginning May 1, 2003. In October 2003,

      Board authorized an increase in the cash dividend to an annual rate of $0.80
      per
      share and increased the dividend again in October 2004 to an annual rate of
      $1.00 per share. In December 2004, the Board authorized a supplemental common

      supplemental dividends of $0.50 per share. In November 2005, the Board
      authorized an increase in our annual common stock dividend to $1.25 per share
      (from $1.00 per share) payable quarterly ($0.3125 per share). In 2006, the
      Board

The

      will
      depend on our financial results, cash requirements, future prospects, the
      outcome of our proposed acquisition of Phelps Dodge and other factors deemed
      relevant by the Board. In addition, payment of dividends on our common stock
      and
      purchases of common stock are subject to limitations under our 10⅛% Senior Notes
      and 6⅞% Senior Notes and, in certain circumstances, our credit
      facility.

Issuer
      Purchases of Equity Securities

In
      October 2003, our Board of Directors approved a new open market share purchase
      program for up to 20 million shares, which replaced our previous program. The
      program does not have an expiration date. No shares were purchased during the
      three-month period ended December 31, 2006, and 12.2 million shares remain
      available for purchase.

For
      the
      ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculation, earnings consist of pre-tax
      income from continuing operations before minority interests in consolidated
      subsidiaries, income or loss from equity investees and fixed charges. Fixed
      charges include interest and that portion of rent deemed representative of
      interest. For the ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock
      dividends calculation, we assumed that our preferred stock dividend requirements
      were equal to the pre-tax earnings that would be required to cover those
      dividend requirements. We computed those pre-tax earnings using actual tax
      rates
      for each year.

      information relating to FCX (including our consolidated subsidiaries) required
      to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings.

Changes
