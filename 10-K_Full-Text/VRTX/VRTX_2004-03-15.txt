PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

We are a biotechnology company in the business of discovering, developing and commercializing small molecule drugs for serious diseases including HIV infection,
chronic hepatitis C virus infection, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders and cancer, independently and with collaborators. Our principal focus is on the development and commercialization of
new treatments for viral and inflammatory diseases. There are two Vertex-discovered products on the market now for the treatment of HIV and AIDS. Our pipeline of potential products includes several
drug candidates targeting chronic hepatitis C virus infection, drug candidates targeting inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, acute coronary syndromes and
psoriasis, and compounds directed at cancer therapy.

Our
goal is to mature into a profitable pharmaceutical company with industry-leading capabilities in research, development and commercialization of products. Our strategy is to continue
building these capabilities as we advance our own product candidates to market. Our two marketed products to date were developed and commercialized in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline, who provided
us with development capacity, financial support, commercial capabilities, and other valuable resources. We plan to continue to collaborate with existing and new partners to develop and market other
Vertex-discovered products for selected major therapeutic areas. We also have begun developing certain potential products independently, for markets in which we believe we can commercialize products
effectively and reach large patient populations, but expend comparatively fewer resources by using a
sales force focused on specialists. We believe this dual approach will help us diversify risk and create the greatest number of product development and commercialization opportunities for Vertex.

Partnerships
are a key component of our corporate strategy. We have collaborations with Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Serono and other companies. These collaborations provide us
with financial support and other valuable resources for our research programs, development resources for our clinical drug candidates, and marketing and sales support for our products. We have had a
long and fruitful collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline, resulting in our two marketed drugs, Agenerase and Lexiva, and the advancement of a third HIV protease inhibitor, VX-385, into
clinical development. We expect that GlaxoSmithKline will commence a Phase II trial of VX-385 in 2004. We currently are collaborating with Aventis in the development of pralnacasan, an ICE
inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Our collaboration with Eli Lilly, now ended, produced one of our HCV drug candidates, VX-950.

We
plan to continue adding promising potential products to our development pipeline through the conduct of our state-of-the-art research programs. Our
drug design approach integrates biology, chemistry, biophysics, automation and information technologies to make the drug discovery process more efficient and productive. We believe that our drug
discovery expertise is a distinguishing feature of the Company. We currently are conducting a productive research program in the area of ion channel modulation, and have been engaged in a broad scale
kinase inhibitor collaboration with Novartis since 2000. We expect that future development candidates from these programs will be focused on the treatment of wide variety of diseases and conditions
including cancer and neuropathic pain.

We
also seek to opportunistically license and acquire technologies, resources and products that have the potential to strengthen our drug discovery platform, product pipeline and
commercial capabilities.

In
two independent transactions closed in March and December 2003, we sold the assets of our Discovery Tools and Services business for an aggregate of $101 million in cash and the
assumption of certain liabilities. As a result of the disposition of these assets, we now operate in a single operating segment: Pharmaceuticals.

Antiviral Programs

HIV/AIDS

Background: Treatment of HIV/AIDS

Infection with human immunosufficiency virus (HIV) leads to AIDS, a severe, life-threatening impairment of the immune system. The World Health
Organization estimates that approximately 36.1 million individuals worldwide are infected with HIV. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are 980,000
patients in the United States infected with HIV.

There
are four classes of antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as AZT and 3TC;
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), such as efavirenz; the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide; and HIV protease inhibitors (PIs). PIs such as Agenerase and Lexiva are used
as part of combination regimens for the treatment of HIV. PIs block the cleavage of HIV polyproteins into active proteins, and result in the production of non-infectious viral particles.
The PI ritonavir has been shown to significantly boost the levels of certain other PIs in the bloodstream and therefore co-administration of PIs with ritonavir has become progressively
more frequent in clinical practice as a strategy for achieving maximum antiviral activity, reducing the likelihood of treatment failure (viral breakthrough), and lowering the overall pill count for
patients. We estimate that approximately 75% of Lexiva patients are treated concomitantly with ritonavir.

Currently,
approximately 175,000 of the HIV patients receiving drug treatment in the U.S. take at least one PI. The market for HIV PIs is highly competitive, with seven different PIs
vying for a share. Worldwide sales of HIV PIs were estimated at more than $1.8 billion in 2003, and U.S. sales alone during the same period were estimated at more than $1 billion.

Vertex HIV/AIDS Products

Agenerase

Our first marketed product is the HIV protease inhibitor Agenerase (amprenavir), an orally administered drug for the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS.
Agenerase received regulatory approval in the U.S. in April 1999. We created and developed Agenerase in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. GlaxoSmithKline markets, and we
co-promote, Agenerase in the U.S. and Europe. We collaborated with Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. to develop amprenavir in Japan, where it is sold by Kissei under the trade name
Prozei™.

Regulatory
authorities have approved once-daily use of Agenerase on the basis of data demonstrating that ritonavir (a PI) significantly boosts levels of Agenerase in the
bloodstream in both once-daily and twice-daily dosing regimens.

We
receive royalties on sales of amprenavir by GlaxoSmithKline and Kissei. We also supply bulk amprenavir drug substance to Kissei.

Lexiva

Our second HIV protease inhibitor, Lexiva (fosamprenavir calcium), was co-discovered by Vertex and GlaxoSmithKline and has been developed by
GlaxoSmithKline under our collaboration. GlaxoSmithKline has worldwide marketing rights for Lexiva, and we have the right to co-promote Lexiva in the United States and the European Union.
We also have the right to supply bulk drug substance to GlaxoSmithKline. We receive royalties on GlaxoSmithKline's sales of Lexiva.

GlaxoSmithKline
conducted an extensive Phase III clinical program for Lexiva, including trials in both treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients. The first study
(NEAT) compared Lexiva to nelfinavir in treatment-naïve patients. The second study (SOLO) compared Lexiva in combination with ritonavir, administered once-daily, to
nelfinavir in treatment-naïve patients. The third study


(CONTEXT)
evaluated both once-daily and twice-daily dosing of Lexiva in combination with ritonavir, compared to lopinavir/ritonavir, in treatment-experienced patients. In all of these
studies, patients received reverse transcriptase inhibitors as part of the combination regimen.

Data
from the Phase III clinical program was presented at various medical conferences in 2002 and 2003. In the NEAT trial, 66% of 166 HIV-positive patients achieved an undetectable viral
load with Lexiva (<400 copies/ml vRNA), compared to 52% of 83 patients taking nelfinavir. In the SOLO study, 69% of 322 HIV-positive patients achieved undetectable viral load
with Lexiva/ritonavir compared to 68% of 327 patients taking nelfinavir. Forty-eight-week data from the CONTEXT study has shown similar efficacy responses in BID regimens of both
Lexiva/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir. The incidence of adverse events was low in the Lexiva treatment groups.

In
December 2002, GlaxoSmithKline filed a New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in the European
Union (E.U.) for marketing approval of Lexiva in the U.S. and E.U. The submissions for registration included data from more than 1,100 treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients
who
participated in the Phase III trials. The FDA approved Lexiva on October 20, 2003. GlaxoSmithKline and Vertex launched Lexiva in the United States shortly thereafter. GlaxoSmithKline currently
is seeking marketing approval for Lexiva (under the name Telzir) in the E.U. We anticipate that E.U. marketing approval will be granted in 2004.

Lexiva
is a prodrug of amprenavir. A prodrug is an inactive compound that is metabolized by the body to become the active drug. Administration of a prodrug can result in a smaller pill
burden for patients, due to the need to use fewer fillers, with a resulting higher ultimate drug load per pill. HIV-infected patients typically require a large number of pills daily as
part of combination drug regimens. We believe that Lexiva will offer important new benefits to HIV patients, including a low pill count and the ability to be dosed once or twice a day. This dosing
benefit could lead to a material increase in physician acceptance of Lexiva, and patient compliance with Lexiva dosing regimens, as compared to other Agenerase and certain other currently marketed
PIs. We also believe that trends in HIV patient demographics and emerging themes in HIV treatment strategy in Western countries may result in increased use of protease inhibitors generally, including
Lexiva.

We
believe that Lexiva retains many of the favorable properties associated with amprenavir, including:

•

a
half-life which allows for convenient twice-daily dosing and provides high levels of the drug in the bloodstream;

•

ability
to be dosed once daily when co-administered with ritonavir;

•

ability
to be dosed effectively with or without food, providing convenience for patients;

•

well
tolerated;

•

relatively
low levels of cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors; and

•

a
favorable lipid profile.

VX-385

We have a third novel, orally available HIV protease inhibitor in clinical development, VX-385 (GW640385), which was co-discovered by
Vertex and GlaxoSmithKline. VX-385 is chemically distinct from Agenerase, Lexiva, and other currently marketed protease inhibitors. Preclinical results presented at medical meetings in
2003 demonstrate that VX-385 is a highly potent inhibitor and demonstrates anti-HIV activity against HIV strains resistant to a number of currently marketed protease
inhibitors. Clinical results to date indicate that VX-385 is well-tolerated in single doses in healthy volunteers and achieves blood levels consistent with those believed to have an antiviral effect.


Our
collaborator GlaxoSmithKline controls development of VX-385 and plans to initiate a Phase II clinical trial of the compound in the second half of 2004.

HEPATITIS C VIRUS INFECTION

Background: Treatment of Hepatitis C

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes chronic inflammation in the liver. In a majority of patients, HCV infection can persist for decades and eventually lead to
cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. HCV infection represents a significant medical problem worldwide. Sources at the CDC have estimated that approximately 2.7 million Americans, or
approximately 1% of the population, are chronically infected with HCV, and the World Health Organization estimates that there are as many as 185 million chronic carriers of the virus worldwide.

Currently,
there is no vaccine available to prevent hepatitis C infection. The current standard treatment for hepatitis C viral infection is a combination of pegylated interferon and
ribavirin. At present, however, approximately 50% of patients still fail to show long-term sustained response to pegylated interferon/ribavirin combination therapy. As a result, new safe
and effective treatment options for HCV infection are needed.

Vertex HCV Drug Candidates

Vertex is developing two drug candidates targeting hepatitis C virus infection by different mechanisms. The most advanced compound is merimepodib, which targets
HCV indirectly and is currently in Phase II development. Vertex's second HCV drug candidate, VX-950, targets the hepatitis C virus directly, by inhibiting hepatitis C
NS3-4A protease, an enzyme necessary for HCV replication. We expect to begin Phase I clinical trials of VX-950 in 2004. Vertex holds all marketing rights to both merimepodib and
VX-950.

Merimepodib

Merimepodib is Vertex's most advanced orally available drug candidate for the treatment of HCV infection. Merimepodib targets HCV infection indirectly through
inhibition of the human enzyme inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). Vertex has conducted

in vitro

experiments that demonstrate that
merimepodib has an additive antiviral effect,

in vitro,

in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.

In
2003, we completed the treatment arms of a triple combination Phase II study of merimepodib with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, to evaluate the safety of the triple combination,
in 31 patients with genotype I HCV infection who did not respond to a previous course of alpha interferon in combination with ribavirin. The study provided for six months of treatment, with an
optional 6-month extension phase for patients who responded to therapy. In 2003, we reported six-month results from this study, indicating that merimepodib was
well-tolerated and, in addition, that merimepodib treatment was associated with a statistically significant, dose-dependent increase in the percentage of patients who had
undetectable HCV viral RNA after six months of treatment.

Merimepodib
was discovered through Vertex's program to discover and develop novel orally administered IMPDH inhibitors. IMPDH inhibition selectively inhibits cell proliferation and/or
the cycle of viral infection by interrupting the biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides and, indirectly, the synthesis of RNA and DNA in the cell, through one of two pathways available to cells for
guanine synthesis. Accordingly, IMPDH is believed to be an attractive target for inhibition of rapid cell proliferation and/or viral replication. Some viruses, including HCV, may be more sensitive to
disruptions in the pathway catalyzed by IMPDH. In addition, IMPDH inhibitors appear to work additively or synergistically with other treatments for HCV, including ribavirin. The specific mechanism by
which merimepodib enhances ribavirin activity is not known, but it has been proposed that merimepodib may increase the likelihood of ribavirin incorporation into viral RNA during replication,


resulting
either in decreased replication or in the production of immature or non-infective viral particles.

In
preclinical and early clinical studies, merimepodib demonstrated potent biological activity and oral bioavailability. Data from a Phase I trial in healthy volunteers showed that
merimepodib was well-tolerated in single escalating doses and achieved blood levels well above those we believe, to be necessary, based on

in
vitro

studies, to achieve potent inhibition of IMPDH. Data from a Phase II clinical trial indicated that merimepodib, when given for 28 days as monotherapy to HCV
patients who were unresponsive to prior treatment with alpha interferon, was well tolerated and appeared to reduce levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, a marker of liver inflammation.

We
have also assessed the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of merimepodib combined with alpha interferon in another Phase II trial involving treatment-naïve
patients with HCV infection. The viral load data from this study showed a trend toward enhanced antiviral activity in patients given one of two doses of merimepodib combined with interferon, as
compared to patients receiving interferon alone. Patients receiving a 100 mg dose of merimepodib three times daily showed a greater reduction in HCV-RNA after 28 days. Merimepodib
treatment was associated with statistically significant viral RNA decreases in this study when treatment-non-compliant patients were excluded from the analysis. These results are consistent with an
additive antiviral effect mediated by merimepodib, when given in combination with alpha interferon.

We
expect to initiate expanded clinical studies of merimepodib in 2004. If our clinical activities progress as planned, we believe we may be able to file a new drug application
(NDA) for merimepodib as early as 2007.

VX-950

In 2001, we selected VX-950, a potent orally-administered HCV protease inhibitor, for preclinical development. We believe that VX-950 is
among the most advanced drug
development candidates in a new class of antiviral drugs being studied to inhibit hepatitis C NS3-4A protease, an enzyme thought to be necessary for HCV replication. We believe that
therapeutics such as VX-950 which directly target viral replication may significantly increase the number of patients that achieve a complete viral response, clearing HCV from the body
permanently. VX-950 has the potential to become one of the first compounds targeting HCV directly and could provide an important treatment advance for individuals with chronic HCV
infection. Promising preclinical results for VX-950 were presented in multiple medical and research forums in 2003. Based on progress in preclinical development in 2003, we expect to begin
Phase I clinical development of VX-950 in 2004, and we may initiate a first study in HCV patients in the second half of 2004. We hold worldwide marketing rights to VX-950 and
all other second-generation HCV protease inhibitors discovered by Vertex in collaboration with Eli Lilly, and would pay Lilly royalties on certain future product sales.

Inflammatory and Autoimmune Disease

Background: ICE Inhibitors for Inflammatory Disease

Interleukin-1

b

converting enzyme (ICE; caspase-1) is an enzyme that controls the release
of active interleukin-1

b

(IL-1

b

, one of two forms of IL-1) and
interleukin-18 (IL-18) from white blood cells into the bloodstream and within tissues. IL-1

b

and IL-18 are cytokines
that mediate a wide range of immune and inflammatory responses in many cell types. Early in the inflammatory process, IL-1

b

is released from
white blood cells, initiating a complex cascade of events that results in inflammation and tissue damage. IL-18 is an important factor in the activation of lymphocytes, a type of white
blood cell. Elevated IL-1

b

and IL-18 levels have been correlated with disease states in a number of acute and chronic
inflammatory diseases.

Rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) is a potential indication for small molecule ICE inhibitors. In patients with RA, increased activity of
IL-1

b

and IL-18 is observed in joint tissues during disease flare-ups, and


IL-1

b

is known to activate osteoclasts, a cell type important in bone erosion characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis. IL-18 may have a
similar effect.

There
are more than 6 million patients with RA worldwide, including approximately 2.1 million in the United States. The main drugs currently used to treat RA are
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Motrin (ibuprofen) and Celebrex (celecoxib). These drugs are palliative—they relieve pain and swelling but do not reverse or prevent
the progression of the disease. Methotrexate is a disease-modifying drug that is widely used, but its use is associated with side effects that include liver toxicity. Even when they tolerate it well,
many patients become unresponsive to methotrexate over the long term. Newer therapies including Enbrel® (etanercept) and Remicade® (infliximab) provide a strong rationale for a
new kind of disease-modifying therapy that involves inhibition of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha. In 2001 Kineret® (anakinra) became the first therapy approved for RA
targeting the cytokine IL-1. All of these newer agents are administered by injection, which can be inconvenient and painful for patients. We believe that a well tolerated oral ICE
inhibitor may have significant commercial advantages over currently available treatments. In addition, we believe that anakinra's activity is different than that of Vertex's ICE inhibitors and is not
predictive of the degree of efficacy our drug candidates could have.

Osteoarthritis
(OA) is also a potential indication for treatment with small molecule ICE inhibitors. OA, a degenerative joint disease, is the most common form of arthritis, afflicting
more than 240 million patients worldwide, including more than 21 million in the United States alone. Onset generally occurs after middle age, and as the disease progresses, it causes the
loss of cartilage, damage to bone, formation of bone spurs, and inflammation of the soft tissues. OA may also occur in joints that have suffered previous injury, have been subjected to repetitive
stress, or have been damaged by prior infection or inflammatory arthritis. Patients with OA experience pain, tenderness, swelling and progressive loss of mobility. Patients with OA currently are
treated with over-the-counter drugs as well as palliative treatments such as NSAIDS and COX-2 inhibitors. These drugs do not address the underlying progressive
joint destruction. Patients with more severe cases may become candidates for partial or total joint replacement surgery.

The
inflammatory response plays a significant role in the joint damage characteristic of OA, and increased cytokine activity has been observed in patients with OA.
IL-1

b

is a key driver of pathology in OA, and results of tests conducted in animal models provide a strong rationale for pursuing
IL-1

b

modulation for the treatment of OA.

Vertex ICE Inhibitors for Inflammatory Disease

Vertex is developing ICE inhibitors for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. We have collaborated with Aventis S.A. in the development of
our most advanced ICE inhibitor, pralnacasan, and we are independently developing a second generation ICE inhibitor, VX-765. We hold worldwide rights to VX-765.

Pralnacasan

We are collaborating with Aventis S.A. in the clinical development of pralnacasan (VX-740). Aventis has invested in parallel clinical trials of
pralnacasan in both RA and OA, in addition to ongoing nonclinical toxicology studies. In 2003, Aventis and Vertex voluntarily suspended the clinical development of pralnacasan, including an ongoing
Phase II RA study, so that Aventis and Vertex could analyze findings that emerged from a 9-month nonclinical toxicology study. In the nonclinical study, high doses of pralnacasan were
associated with the development of fibrosis in circumscribed areas of the liver of one species of animal. Aventis and Vertex are committed to exploring the toxicology issue with the goal of
re-initiating clinical development as soon as prudently possible. The companies' best estimate is that, if the toxicology issue is satisfactorily addressed, development of pralnacasan will
be delayed at least 12-24 months from the original timeline. If the toxicology findings cannot be satisfactorily addressed, development of pralnacasan may be discontinued.


In
2002, Aventis completed a 284 patient Phase IIa study in RA to evaluate clinical activity using standard measures of response to treatment, including the American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, which measure improvement in patient-reported and physician-assessed disease severity and activity. Data from the Phase IIa clinical trial demonstrated that
treatment with pralnacasan was well tolerated and led to positive anti-inflammatory effects in patients with RA. Aventis previously had completed a Phase IIa 28-day clinical
trial of pralnacasan in patients with RA to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of pralnacasan. Results showed dose-dependent suppression of the production of
interleukin-1

b

, a cytokine that plays a role in inflammation and tissue damage.

In
2003, prior to the adverse nonclinical toxicology finding, Aventis completed a Phase II study of pralnacasan in OA. The purpose of this study was to enable Vertex and Aventis to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of pralnacasan in OA patients. More than 500 patients were enrolled in the OA study, and received one of three doses of pralnacasan or placebo for 12 weeks.
Pralnacasan was well-tolerated across all three dosage groups. There was improvement (29-35%) in all four treatment groups in the primary endpoint, total WOMAC scores, during
the 12 weeks of study. The WOMAC is the "Western Ontario and McMasters Universities" scale for measuring signs and symptoms in OA studies. However, there were no statistically significant differences
in the change in total WOMAC score between placebo treatment and any of the pralnacasan treatment groups. However, statistically significant changes in some urine and serum markers of bone and
cartilage turnover were observed. Interpretation of these results in the context of modifying the progression of OA requires additional scientific understanding, which will require further clinical
validation.

Under
our 1999 agreement, Aventis holds an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and market pralnacasan in any indication, as well as an exclusive option for certain other
compounds discovered under our previous research collaboration with Aventis. We will receive milestone payments
for successful development of pralnacasan in RA, as well as for each additional indication, if any, for which it is developed. In addition, we will receive royalties on any sales of pralnacasan, and
Aventis will partially fund a Vertex co-promotion effort in the U.S.

VX-765

VX-765 is the first clinical candidate to be selected for clinical development from our second generation ICE inhibitor research program. VX-765 is
chemically distinct from pralnacasan. In 2003, we completed Phase I clinical studies of VX-765 in healthy volunteers. These studies demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in
levels of the cytokine interleukin-18, the first time this has been demonstrated for any therapeutic agent. Preclinical data show that VX-765 reduces inflammation and cytokine
levels in animal dermatitis and arthritis models. We plan to initiate additional clinical studies of VX-765 in an inflammatory or autoimmune disease in 2004. We hold worldwide development
and commercial rights to VX-765.

Background: p38 MAP Kinase Inhibitors for Acute Coronary Syndromes and other Inflammatory Diseases

The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are a family of structurally-related human enzymes involved in intracellular signaling pathways that enable cells to
respond to their environment. The p38 MAP kinase is a human enzyme involved in the onset and progression of inflammation and apoptosis (cell death). When activated, the p38 MAP kinase triggers
production of the cytokines IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Excess levels of IL-1 and TNF-alpha are associated
with a broad range of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.

We
have extensive pre-clinical and clinical experience with p38 MAP kinase inhibitors, which have the potential to be a powerful and broadly useful new class of oral
anti-inflammatory drugs. The initial objective of our p38 program was to identify and extensively evaluate compounds that target p38 MAP kinase to develop novel, orally active drugs for
the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as


rheumatoid
arthritis, asthma, Crohn's disease, certain hematologic disorders, congestive heart failure, and neurological diseases such as stroke.

The
central role of inflammation in many cardiovascular diseases has been well established. Specifically, inflammation is increasingly recognized as a key component of the overall
process in the development of coronary artery disease and particularly acute coronary syndromes (ACS). ACS is a broad term that
includes unstable angina and certain types of myocardial infarctions. P38 MAP kinase regulates the production of key proinflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of ACS, including
TNF-alpha, IL-l

b

and IL-6. As a potential once-daily therapy addressing a novel target for ACS, a potent p38 MAP
kinase inhibitor could provide an approach to complement current therapies for this disease, which affects nearly 1.9 million individuals in the U.S. each year.

VX-702—Vertex's p38 MAP kinase inhibitor for inflammatory diseases

We have collaborated with Kissei on the discovery and development of novel p38 MAP kinase inhibitors since 1997. The research portion of our collaboration with
Kissei was completed in 2000. Kissei holds rights to our p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, VX-702, in Japan and certain other Asian countries, and we hold all development and commercial rights elsewhere.

We
initiated a Phase I clinical study of VX-702 in June 2002. The double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was designed to test the safety, tolerability,
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VX-702 in single and multiple doses in healthy volunteers. Results from this Phase I study supported further clinical development of VX-702.

We
began Phase II development of VX-702 in 2003. We intend to explore the potential of VX-702 in a variety of disease settings in which inflammation plays an
important role. We have decided to advance the clinical development of VX-702 initially in acute disease indications. The initial focus of the Phase II program is aimed at the use of
VX-702 as an ACS therapy. We expect our pilot Phase II clinical trial of VX-702 in ACS to be completed in 2004. A third compound discovered by Vertex, VX-850, is in
preclinical development and serves as a backup to VX-702.

Other Clinical Development Candidates

VX-680

VX-680 is the first kinase inhibitor to be advanced by Vertex with potential for the treatment of cancer. VX-680 is a potent inhibitor of
Aurora kinases and of Flt-3 kinase. Aurora kinases are enzymes thought to play multiple roles in the development and progression of cancer, acting as regulators of cell proliferation,
transforming normal cells into cancer cells and downregulating p53, one of the body's natural tumor suppressors.
Flt-3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is known to be inappropriately activated in several different types of leukemia. Inhibitors of Aurora kinases and Flt-3 have the
potential to be useful as highly targeted treatments for a range of oncology indications.

Vertex
researchers published the three-dimensional atomic structure of Aurora-A kinase in 2002, and published the structure of Flt-3 kinase in
January 2004. We also presented preclinical data in a number of research and medical venues in 2003 that indicate the potential of VX-680 to treat several different cancer types for
which there are currently few or no available treatments. In a paper published in February 2004, researchers at Vertex reported demonstrating for the first time that a selective small molecule
inhibitor of the Aurora kinase (VX-680) profoundly inhibits tumor growth and induces tumor regression in

in vivo

cancer models.

Vertex
has filed an IND for the clinical study of VX-680 in the United States, and we expect that Phase I clinical studies of VX-680 will be initiated in 2004. We
discovered VX-680 in collaboration with Novartis. Under our amended agreement with Novartis, we may elect either to continue development of VX-680 under the terms of the original agreement with
Novartis, using loan proceeds from the Novartis loan facility, or to develop VX-680 independently or with a third party. If we choose to


continue
development under the original agreement, Novartis will have an option on worldwide commercial rights to VX-680.

VX-944

VX-944 is an oral IMPDH inhibitor with potential for the treatment of cancer. Results from certain preclinical studies of VX-944 have
suggested that VX-944 has potent anti-tumor activity. Phase I clinical studies of VX-944 in healthy volunteers demonstrated that VX-944 is orally
bioavailable and well-tolerated. Vertex is now evaluating the possibility of entering into a collaborative relationship for more advanced clinical development of VX-944.

RESEARCH and EARLY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

Vertex Drug Design Platform and Drug Discovery Strategy

We believe that our integrated drug design approach has significantly enhanced our ability to discover and develop small molecule drug candidates directed at
biologically complex targets, including novel targets identified in genomic research. We believe that our approach has been validated through our collaborations and success in moving drug candidates
into clinical trials.

Integrated Drug Design Approach.

Our drug design platform integrates advanced biology, biophysics, chemistry, automation and
information technologies in a coordinated and simultaneous fashion throughout the discovery process. The goal of our integrated, interdisciplinary approach is to increase the speed and predictability
of drug discovery and development.

Focused Drug Discovery in Target-Rich Gene Families.

Vertex has pioneered a novel approach to drug discovery in
target-rich gene families. Our approach organizes and prioritizes targets within gene families, which are groups of genes with similar sequences that code for structurally similar
proteins. This approach essentially clusters targets according to how they interact with chemical inhibitors, and allows us to use high-throughput screening technologies, informatics and
medicinal chemistry to rapidly identify drug-like classes of compounds in parallel for multiple targets. In concert with this approach, we use a variety of biological and chemical
methodologies that interrogate the function of newly discovered proteins in order to focus our drug discovery and development efforts on the most promising targets within the most promising gene
families. We believe that our systematic application of this drug discovery approach is increasing the speed and efficiency of drug design efforts directed at novel biological targets, and is securing
valuable intellectual property for us in gene families of interest.

Technology Platform

Our integrated technology platform employs a variety of technologies and uses information from a number of different scientific disciplines. The most significant
of them are as follows.

Functional Genomics.

We use functional genomics techniques, such as gene knock-out mice, to help guide target selection and test the
potential of chemical compounds in disease models. Our patented GenomeScreen™ technology allows us to identify and validate targets by scanning the genome of living human cells and
identifying those genes activated or repressed in various disease states. We have used GenomeScreen to assist us in mapping gene activation and cell signaling pathways and in characterizing poorly
understood cellular processes. We also use antisense, siRNA, dominant negative cell lines, and other biological approaches to better characterize the role played by specific targets in cellular
processes.

Biophysics.

We generate atomic structural information on molecular targets using X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy to guide design and optimization of lead classes of drugs.

Computer-based Modeling.

We apply advanced proprietary computational modeling tools to guide the evaluation and selection of compounds
for synthesis.
During our virtual ("in silico")


screening
process, candidate compounds are selected for synthesis and screening. We use proprietary algorithms to sort and filter compounds for specific properties in order to seek compounds that are
more likely to become development candidates.

Pharmacology.

We employ a number of approaches to obtain predictive information on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile of
potential drug
candidates. These approaches include

in vitro

metabolism and toxicological studies and

in vivo

assessment of leads in predictive animal models.

Assay Development.

We use assay development and screening techniques, built upon a number of gene reporter technologies such as green
fluorescent
protein (GFP) and beta lactamase, to rapidly generate large numbers of lead compounds and drug candidates across certain gene families. We are also utilizing our assay development capabilities to
develop novel proprietary assays to establish ADME/toxicology profiles for compounds in our screening library.

High-Throughput Screening.

We conduct assays for most enzyme and receptor targets using the ultra high-throughput screening
(UHTSS) system, which integrates compound management, plate replication with miniaturized screening, hit (potential lead) identification and follow-up. The ultra
high-throughput capability is achieved through the use of a 3,456 well assay microplate.

Instrumentation.

Some of our ion channel research is conducted using E-VIPR, our proprietary screening technology which uses fluorescent
probes and waves of electrical stimulation to study ion channels. E-VIPR provides an automated, high-throughput platform which enables us to collect high quality data at speeds
up to a thousand times faster than patch clamping. We can use E-VIPR to study both fast and slow channel activity and state dependence, a phenomenon in which compounds bind preferentially to certain
conformations of channels. With respect to voltage-gated channels, electrical stimulation eliminates the need for the addition of liquids and pharmacological modifiers which often distort the native
conformation and activity of ion channels.

Current Research Programs

Our past drug discovery efforts have produced a variety of drug candidates for development by Vertex or its partners. We believe our ongoing research programs,
particularly those directed at the kinase and ion channel gene families, continue to create potential value for Vertex by generating new product candidates in areas of significant unmet medical need.

Kinase Program

We have a broad-based drug discovery effort targeting the human protein kinase family, of which there are approximately 500 members. Protein kinases are enzymes
that play a key role in transmitting signals between and within cells. Kinases exert their effect by phosphorylating other proteins, which then become activated and perform a specific function. Kinase
activity has been implicated in most major diseases, including cancer and autoimmune, inflammatory, cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurological diseases. As a result, kinases can be ideal targets for
therapeutic intervention. The clinical success of the oncology drugs Gleevec (Novartis) and Iressa (AstraZeneca) offer examples of how small molecule kinase inhibitors can be tailored to address
specific diseases.

In
May 2000 we entered into an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule drugs directed at protein
kinases. We expect the research effort under this agreement, which was amended in early 2004, to continue through April 2006. The support provided by Novartis is enabling us to conduct extensive
parallel drug design efforts within the kinase target family.

In
2003, we filed an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA covering VX-680, a potent small molecule inhibitor of Aurora kinases and Flt-3 kinase. Aurora kinases are
three closely-related proteins required in rapidly dividing cells. Inhibition of Aurora kinase activity with a small


molecule
may provide a means of slowing or reversing the uncontrolled cell growth observed in cancer. In addition it is thought that more than 30% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
have activating mutations of Flt-3. Thus VX-680 could provide therapeutic benefits for patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies including AML. Under our restructured
agreement with Novartis, we may either continue development of VX-680 under the terms of our original agreement with Novartis, or elect to develop and commercialize VX-680 independent of Novartis.

Vertex
has drug discovery efforts underway targeting several other kinases, including those that play a role in the development and progression of cancer, inflammation and autoimmune
disease.

The
infrastructure created over the first three years of the Novartis/Vertex collaboration has enabled a parallel approach to drug discovery in the kinase gene family. Our researchers
have determined the atomic structure of more than 20 kinase drug targets and more than 300 kinase/inhibitor co-complexes, providing information to help accelerate drug design and further our
understanding of the role kinases play in disease. Most recently, Vertex researchers published structural interpretations of the process by which mutations in kinases like Flt-3 can lead to
uncontrolled cellular proliferation and cancer. Using proprietary

in silico

and

in vitro

methodologies,
Vertex has designed a diverse library of proprietary kinase inhibitors, leading to the filing of more than 90 patents covering many hundreds of distinct chemical scaffolds. Over the next several
years, we expect to advance a number of kinase inhibitors as development candidates targeting multiple therapeutic areas.

Ion Channel Program

We are conducting a broad-based drug discovery program targeting the ion channel family. Ion channels are a gene family of more than 500 proteins that act
as cellular gatekeepers, controlling the flow of ions across cell membranes. The ion channel target family contains numerous druggable targets representing potential therapeutic intervention points
for indications including cystic fibrosis, neuropathic pain and inflammatory, cardio-vascular, and metabolic diseases. Existing therapies such as amlodipine and nifedipine, which are calcium channel
blockers for the treatment of hypertension, and lamotrigine and carbamezepine, which are sodium channel inhibitors for the treatment of epilepsy, provide a strong rationale for developing drugs
targeting ion channels.

Our
ion channel research extends across several ion channel subfamilies, including sodium channels and calcium channels, and is principally focused on the design and development of small
molecule drugs for the treatment of neuropathic pain and cystic fibrosis. Specific sodium channels have been shown to increase in expression and function in peripheral nerve cells at the site of
injury, making them novel and attractive targets for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Ion channel modulators also could be important therapeutic agents for cystic fibrosis, a chronic, progressive
genetic disorder. We have an ongoing research collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation targeting the cystic fibrosis regulator protein (CFTR). The symptoms of cystic fibrosis, particularly
the development of thick mucous that causes lung tissue inflammation and damage, are caused by a defect in CFTR. A CFTR channel modulator potentially may slow or halt the progression of cystic
fibrosis.

We
are utilizing our expertise in assay development and screening to advance discovery efforts within the ion channel family. Our capabilities are augmented by the use of E-VIPR, our
proprietary ion channel screening technology. E-VIPR uses fluorescent probes and waves of electrical stimulation to study ion channels in an automated high-throughput platform enabling the collection
of high quality data at speeds up to a thousand times faster than patch-clamping.

Caspase Program

The human caspase family is a subfamily of proteases which presently include 11 structurally related enzymes that play specific roles in inflammation and
apoptosis (programmed cell death). We are conducting research focused on the design of small molecules which can potentially exert a protective effect on cells in specific tissues by inhibiting
caspase-mediated apoptotic and inflammatory processes.


Through gene knockout studies, our scientists have gained important insight into the biological role of different caspases in the activation of apoptosis in specific cells and tissues.
Vertex research teams have solved the three-dimensional atomic structures of four caspases, including one caspase from each of the three caspase subfamilies, and more than 50 enzyme/inhibitor
complexes.

Potential
indications for caspase inhibitor compounds include tissue damage related to acute conditions such as stroke, myocardial ischemia and sepsis, and neurodegenerative disorders
such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We are collaborating in a portion of our caspase program with Serono S.A. under an agreement signed in 2000, covering the development and
commercialization of certain caspase inhibitors in the U.S. and the European Union.

Bacterial Gyrase

We are engaged in the discovery of novel antibiotics that target DNA gyrase B, an essential enzyme found in many bacteria. DNA gyrase is utilized during the
bacterial replication process. DNA gyrase inhibitors already on the market have proven to be potent, broad-spectrum antibiotics and are used to treat a variety of common gram-positive and
gram-negative infections in various treatment settings. Existing gyrase inhibitors work by interacting with the gyrase A subunit. In contrast, we are targeting the gyrase B subunit, and
specifically the ATP-binding site that is common to multiple species of bacteria. We have discovered a class of molecules that also shows activity against the highly similar par E subunit
of topoisomerase IV, another essential bacterial enzyme. These dual gyrB/parE inhibitors not only appear to be potent in preclinical testing, but may also be less susceptible to the development of
drug resistance, a major and growing problem with marketed antibiotics. We are currently optimizing this dual inhibitor class and may select a clinical candidate in 2004.

Additional Discovery Efforts

We plan to utilize our proprietary gene family-based platform and experience in structure-based drug design to pursue targets in other medically important gene
families. We have exploratory efforts underway targeting g-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear receptors, among other things, as well as a program directed toward second
generation HCV inhibitors.

Corporate Collaborations

We have entered into corporate collaborations with pharmaceutical companies that provide financial and other resources, including capabilities in research,
development, manufacturing, and sales and marketing, to support our research and development programs. At present, we have the following major corporate collaborations:

Novartis Pharma AG

In May 2000, we entered into an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule
drugs directed at protein kinases. We amended this collaboration agreement in February 2004. Under the original agreement, we were responsible for drug discovery and clinical proof-of-concept testing
of all drug candidates. Novartis agreed, among other things, to pay us up to $200,000,000 in product research funding through April 2006, and to loan us up to $200,000,000 on a non-interest-bearing
basis to support our clinical studies. We continue to be responsible for drug discovery under the amended agreement, and Novartis will continue to provide research funding through the end of the
six-year research term. However, under the agreement as modified, Novartis will be responsible for all clinical and nonclinical development of drug candidates which it accepts for development, and
consequently the loan facility has been eliminated. We may either continue development of VX-680 under the terms of the original agreement, using loan proceeds we have received under the Novartis loan
facility, or elect to develop and commercialize VX-680 independent of Novartis. If we elect to develop and commercialize VX-680 independent of Novartis, loan amounts with respect to that drug
candidate which are unspent and


uncommitted
at the time of our election will be repayable immediately. At December 31, 2003, approximately $14 million in development loans previously advanced to us on account of VX-680
were unspent and uncommitted. The agreement also provides up to $35 million in license fees and milestones for each preclinical drug candidate nominated by us and accepted by Novartis. Novartis
will have exclusive worldwide development, manufacturing and marketing rights to drug candidates that it accepts from us for development. We will receive royalties on any products that are marketed as
part of the collaboration.

GlaxoSmithKline

In December 1993, we entered into a collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline covering the research, development and commercialization of HIV protease inhibitors,
including Agenerase (amprenavir), Lexiva (fosamprenavir calcium) and VX-385. Under the original agreement, GlaxoSmithKline had exclusive rights to develop and commercialize our HIV
protease inhibitors in all
parts of the world except the Far East. In 2003, we amended the agreement to add the Far East to GlaxoSmithKline's territory for development and commercialization of Lexiva. GlaxoSmithKline pays us a
royalty on all sales of the HIV protease inhibitors covered by the agreement. We have retained certain bulk drug manufacturing rights and certain co-promotion rights in the territories
licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. Under the collaborative agreement, GlaxoSmithKline agreed to pay us up to $42 million, comprised of a $15 million up-front license payment made
in 1993, $14 million of product research funding over five years and $13 million of development and commercialization milestone payments for an initial drug candidate. We have received
the entire $42 million. We began receiving royalties on sales of Agenerase in 1999 and on Lexiva in 2003. GlaxoSmithKline is also obligated to pay us additional development and
commercialization milestone payments for subsequent drug candidates, including Lexiva and VX-385. In addition, GlaxoSmithKline is required to bear the costs of development in its territory
under the collaboration.

GlaxoSmithKline
has the right to terminate its agreement with us without cause upon 12 months' notice. Termination of the agreement by GlaxoSmithKline will relieve it of its obligation
to make further commercialization and development milestone and royalty payments, and will end any license granted by us to GlaxoSmithKline under the agreement.

In
June 1996, we and GlaxoSmithKline obtained a worldwide, non-exclusive license under certain G.D. Searle & Co. (now owned by Pharmacia/Pfizer) patents in the area of HIV
protease inhibition. We pay Searle a royalty based on sales of Agenerase and Lexiva.

Aventis S.A.

In September 1999, we entered into an expanded agreement with Aventis S.A., formerly Hoechst Marion Roussel Deutschland GmbH (HMR), covering the development of
pralnacasan. Aventis has an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and market pralnacasan, as well as an exclusive option for certain other compounds discovered as part of the research
collaboration between HMR and us that ended in 1997. Aventis will fund the development of pralnacasan. We may co-promote the product in the United States and Europe and will receive
royalties on global sales, if any. Under the agreement, Aventis has paid us a $20 million up-front payment for prior research costs, and has agreed to pay us up to
$62 million in milestone payments for successful development by Aventis of pralnacasan for rheumatoid arthritis, the first targeted indication. Milestone payments are also due for each
additional indication. The agreement also provides that Aventis will partially fund a Vertex co-promotion effort in the U.S. under certain conditions. Aventis has the right to terminate
this agreement without cause upon six months' written notice. Termination by Aventis will end any license we have granted Aventis under the agreement.


Serono S.A.

In December 2000, we entered into a collaboration with Serono S.A. to discover, develop, and market certain types of caspase inhibitors. Under the terms of the
agreement, we could receive up to $95 million of pre-commercial payments, based on the successful development and commercialization of more than one drug candidate, to support and expand our
drug discovery activities in the caspase protein family. That amount would include milestone payments as drug candidates move through development. Of that total, we have received $5 million in
up-front payments for prior research, and could also receive up to $20 million in research funding, some of which has been paid, over the five year agreement term. The two companies
will share development costs. We have the option to establish a joint venture with Serono for the commercialization of products in North America, where we will share marketing rights and profits from
the sale of drug products, if any. Serono will have exclusive rights to market caspase inhibitors in other territories, excluding Japan and certain other countries in the Far East, and will pay us for
supplies of drug substance. Serono has the right to terminate the agreement without cause effective at the end of 2004 upon written notice delivered on or before the end of June 2004.

Other Collaborations

Schering AG (Germany).

In August 1998, we entered into a collaboration with Schering AG covering the research,
development and commercialization of novel, orally active neurophilin ligand compounds to promote nerve regeneration for the treatment of a number of neurological diseases. Vertex and Schering AG have
an equal role in management of neurophilin ligand research and product development. Research funding under this agreement has concluded. We have amended the original agreement to extend Schering's
option to designate a compound or compounds for development under the agreement until September 2004. In North America, we will have manufacturing rights to, and we will share equally with
Schering AG in the marketing expenses and profits from, any compounds which may be selected for development and commercialization. Schering AG will have the right to manufacture and market any
commercialized compounds in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and will pay us a royalty on any product sales. Schering AG has the right to terminate the agreement without cause upon six months'
written notice.

Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

Kissei launched our HIV protease inhibitor amprenavir (Agenerase) in Japan under the
name Prozei in 1999 and pays us a royalty on all sales of Prozei. In September 1997, we entered into a collaboration with Kissei to identify and develop compounds that target p38 MAP kinase. We
are collaborating with Kissei in the development and commercialization of VX-702, a novel, orally active p38 MAP kinase inhibitor for the treatment of ACS and inflammatory diseases. Kissei
has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize VX-702 in Japan and certain Southeast Asian countries, and semi-exclusive rights in China, Taiwan and South Korea. We retain
exclusive marketing rights in the United States, Canada, Europe, and the rest of the world. In addition, we will have the right to supply bulk drug material to Kissei for sale in its territory, and
will receive royalties and drug supply payments on any product sales. The research program ended on June 30, 2000, and we have received the full amount of research funding
specified under the agreement. Kissei has the right to terminate the agreement without cause upon six months' notice.

Eli Lilly & Company.

In June 1997, we entered into a collaboration with Eli Lilly covering the development of novel
small molecule compounds to treat hepatitis C infection, including VX-950. In December 2001, together with Eli Lilly, we selected VX-950 for development. In
December 2002, we restructured our agreement with Eli Lilly, ending the research collaboration approximately six months early and providing us with worldwide rights to compounds identified
during the collaboration. We will pay Eli Lilly a royalty on any future sales of drug products developed from VX-950 and other certain other HCV protease inhibitor compounds.


Intellectual Property

We actively seek, when appropriate, protection for our products and proprietary information by means of United States and foreign patents, trademarks and
contractual arrangements. In addition, we rely upon trade secrets and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information and products. In addition to patents and pending patent
applications that relate to potential drug targets, compounds we are developing to modulate those targets, and methods of making or using those compounds, we have several patents and pending patent
applications directed to proprietary elements of our drug discovery platform. These include patent applications claiming our E-VIPR platform which enables optical membrane potential assays
for detecting activity of rapidly gating ion channels, and methods of using our E-VIPR platform for high-throughput screening of voltage-gated ion channels.

Much
of our technology and many of our processes depend upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel. To protect our rights to our proprietary
know-how and technology, we require all employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of Vertex confidential information to
anyone outside Vertex. These agreements typically require disclosure and assignment to Vertex of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by employees, consultants and advisors.

Patents and Pending Applications

We have issued patents and pending applications in the United States, and in foreign countries we deem appropriate, covering intellectual property developed as
part of each of our most advanced research, development and commercial programs. These include:

•

issued
United States patents that cover classes of chemical compounds, pharmaceutical formulations and/or uses of the same for treating HIV infection and AIDS. The patents
include specific coverage for amprenavir and its pharmaceutical formulations, methods of manufacture and methods to treat HIV infection or AIDS-related central nervous system disorders. We
have a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain Searle patent applications claiming HIV protease inhibitors. We have an issued patent in the United States and patents and pending
applications in other countries claiming fosamprenavir and related compounds, as well as VX-385.

•

issued

Manufacturing

We rely on third party manufacturers and collaborative partners to produce our compounds for clinical purposes and may do so for commercial production of any drug
candidates that are approved for marketing. Commercial manufacturing of Agenerase and Lexiva is being done by GlaxoSmithKline. We retain the option to manufacture a portion of GlaxoSmithKline's
requirements for bulk drug substance for Agenerase and Lexiva. If we were to exercise that option, we believe we would need to rely upon one or more contract manufacturers to manufacture the bulk drug
substance on our behalf.

We
have established a quality assurance program intended to ensure that third party manufacturers under contract produce our compounds in accordance with the FDA's current Good
Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and other applicable regulations.

We
believe that all of our clinical drug candidates can be produced using established manufacturing methods, primarily through standard techniques of pharmaceutical synthesis. We believe
that we will be able to continue to negotiate third party manufacturing arrangements on commercially reasonable terms and that it will not be necessary for us to develop an internal manufacturing
capability in order to successfully commercialize our products. Our objective is to maintain flexibility in deciding whether to develop internal manufacturing capabilities for certain of our potential
products. However, if we are unable to obtain contract manufacturing, or obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned. We
have limited experience in manufacturing pharmaceutical or other products or in conducting manufacturing testing programs required to obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals, and there can be no
assurance that we will further develop those capabilities successfully.

Since
most of our potential products are at an early stage of development, we will need to improve or modify our existing manufacturing processes and capabilities to produce commercial
quantities of any drug product economically. We cannot quantify the time or expense that may ultimately be required to
improve or modify our existing process technologies, but it is possible that such time or expense could be substantial.

The
production of our drug candidates is based in part on technology that we believe to be proprietary. We may license this technology to contract manufacturers to enable them to
manufacture drug candidates for us. In addition, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our drug candidates that the manufacturer owns either
independently or jointly with us. This would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have our products manufactured.

Competition

We are engaged in biopharmaceutical fields characterized by extensive research efforts, rapid technological progress and intense competition. There are many
public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies, chemical companies and biotechnology companies, engaged in developing products for the same human therapeutic applications as those we
are targeting. In order for us to compete successfully, we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy, ease of manufacturing


and
market acceptance of our products over those of our competitors who have received regulatory approval and currently are marketing their drugs. In the field of HIV protease inhibition, Abbott
Laboratories, Inc., Bristol Myers Squibb, Gilead, Hoffmann-La Roche, Merck & Co., Inc. and Pfizer Inc., among others, have other HIV protease inhibitor drugs in
development or on the market. Similarly, a variety of companies are attempting to develop new treatments for hepatitis C virus infection. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial,
technical and human resources than ours and are more experienced in the development of new drugs.

Government Regulation

Our development, manufacture and potential sale of therapeutics are subject to extensive regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities. In
particular, pharmaceutical products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and to other approval requirements by the FDA in the United States under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,
and by comparable agencies in most foreign countries.

Approval Process.

As an initial step in the FDA regulatory approval process, preclinical studies typically are conducted in animals to identify potential safety problems. For
certain diseases, animal models exist that are believed to be predictive of human efficacy. For such diseases, a drug candidate is tested in an animal model. The results of the studies are submitted
to the FDA as a part of the Investigational New Drug application (IND) which is filed to comply with FDA regulations prior to commencement of human clinical testing in the U.S. For diseases for which
no appropriately predictive animal model exists, no such results can be filed. For several of our drug candidates, no appropriately predictive model exists. As a result, no

in
vivo

evidence of efficacy will be available until those compounds progress to human clinical trials. A variety of nonclinical trials in a number of animal species, and other
nonclinical studies, are ordinarily conducted while human clinical trials are underway, to provide supplemental toxicology and other information and to help provide a foundation for the design of
broader and more lengthy human clinical trials as human clinical studies progress through the approval process.

Clinical
trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap. In Phase I, which frequently begins with the initial introduction of the drug into
healthy human subjects prior to introduction into patients, the drug candidate is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, bioavailability, biodistribution, metabolism, excretion, clinical
pharmacology and, if possible, for early information on effectiveness. Phase II typically involves studies in a small sample of the intended patient population to assess the efficacy and duration of
the drug for a specific indication, to determine dose tolerance and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects. Phase III trials are
undertaken to further evaluate clinical safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed study sites, to determine the overall risk-benefit ratio of the
drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Each trial is conducted in accordance with certain standards under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be
used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical study must be evaluated by an independent
Institutional Review Board at the institution at which the study will be conducted. The Institutional Review Board will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and
the possible liability of the institution.

Data
from nonclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in a New Drug Application (NDA) for marketing approval. The process of completing nonclinical and clinical
testing and obtaining FDA approval for a new drug is likely to take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. Preparing an NDA involves considerable data collection,
verification, analysis and expense, and there can be no assurance that approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The approval process is affected by a number of factors, including the
severity of the disease, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical


trials.
The FDA may deny an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional testing or information. Among the conditions for marketing approval is the requirement
that the prospective manufacturer's quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to the FDA's cGMP regulations, which must be followed at all times. In complying with standards set forth in
these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both
foreign and domestic, also are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by or under the authority of other federal, state or local agencies.

Timing to Approval.

We estimate that it takes 10 to 15 years (the industry average is 12 years) to discover, develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in
the U.S. as outlined below:

Phase:

Objective:

Estimated

Duration:

Discovery

Lead identification and target validation

2 to 4 years

Pre-Clinical

Initial toxicology for preliminary identification of risks for humans; gather early pharmacokinetic data

1 to 2 years

Phase I

Evaluate safety in humans; study how the drug works, metabolizes and interacts with other drugs

1 to 2 years

Phase II

Establish effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage; continue safety evaluation

2 to 4 years

Phase III

Confirm efficacy, dosage regime and safety profile of the drug

2 to 4 years

FDA approval

Approval by the FDA to sell and market the drug under approved labeling

6 months to 2 years

Animal
and other nonclinical studies are typically conducted during each phase of human clinical studies.

Post-approval Studies.

Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies, including post-approval studies, may be required to provide additional data on
safety and will be required to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested. Also, the FDA will require
post-approval reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug. Results of post-approval programs may limit or expand further marketing of the drug product. Further, if there
are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indication, manufacturing process, labeling or manufacturing facilities, an NDA supplement may be required to be submitted to the FDA.

Other Regulations.

Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, a sponsor may be granted marketing exclusivity for a period of time following FDA
approval of certain drug applications, if FDA approval is received before the expiration of the patent's original term. This marketing exclusivity would prevent a third party from obtaining FDA
approval for a similar or identical drug through an Abbreviated New Drug Application, which is the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. The statute also
allows a patent owner to extend the term of the patent for a period equal to one-half the period of time elapsed between the filing of an IND and the filing of the corresponding NDA plus
the period of time between the filing of the NDA and FDA approval. We intend to seek the benefits of this statute, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such benefits.

Whether
or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a drug product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of commercial sales of


the
product in such countries. Historically, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product approvals, and the time required for approval, have varied widely from country to
country.

In
addition to the statutes and regulations described above, we are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic
Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state and local regulations.

portion of their time to us. In addition to our Scientific Advisory Board, we have established consulting relationships with a number of scientific and medical experts who advise us on a
project-specific basis.


RISK FACTORS

WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER AGENERASE SALES WILL CONTINUE AT CURRENT LEVELS OR IF LEXIVA SALES WILL BE AT A LEVEL AT OR ABOVE SALES LEVELS FOR AGENERASE.

Agenerase's share of the worldwide protease inhibitor market may decrease due to competitive forces and market dynamics, including the launch of Lexiva, which
took place in the fourth quarter of 2003. Similarly, Lexiva may face similar competitive pressures. Other HIV protease inhibitors and a number of other products, including Gilead's Viread, DuPont's
Sustiva and GlaxoSmithKline's Ziagen, are on the market for the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. Other drugs are still in development by our competitors, including Bristol Myers Squibb and
Boehringer Ingelheim, which may have better efficacy, fewer side effects, easier administration and/or lower costs than Agenerase or Lexiva. Moreover, the growth in the worldwide market for HIV
protease inhibitors has, to a certain extent, occurred as a result of early and aggressive treatment of HIV infection with a protease inhibitor-based regimen. Changes in treatment strategy, in which
treatment is initiated later in the course of infection, or in which treatment is more often initiated with a regimen that does not include a protease inhibitor, may result in less use of HIV protease
inhibitors. In addition, the clinical benefit of strategies used by clinicians to boost drug levels of Agenerase (and possibly Lexiva) by co-administering other antiretroviral agents may
not prove to be effective, or may not result in increased revenues. As a result, the total market for protease inhibitors, in the U.S. and Europe, may decline, decreasing the sales potential of
Agenerase and Lexiva. Further, although we co-promote Agenerase and Lexiva in the U.S. and key markets in Europe (if Lexiva is approved in Europe), GlaxoSmithKline directs the majority of
the marketing and sales efforts and we will have little control over the success of those efforts. GlaxoSmithKline has the right to terminate its agreement with us without cause upon 12 months'
notice.

WE MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP OUR DRUG PIPELINE.

All of the products that we are pursuing independently and with partners will require extensive additional development, testing and investment, as well as
regulatory approvals, prior to commercialization. Our product research and development efforts may not be successful. Our drug candidates may not enter preclinical, nonclinical or clinical studies as
or when anticipated or receive the required regulatory approvals. Moreover, our products, if introduced, may not be commercially successful. The results of preclinical and initial clinical trials of
products under development by us are not necessarily predictive of results that will be obtained from large-scale clinical testing. Clinical trials of products under development may not demonstrate
the safety and efficacy of such products or result in a marketable product. Findings in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical studies could adversely impact the development of our
products. In addition, the administration, alone or in combination with other drugs, of any product developed by us may produce undesirable side effects in humans.

The
failure to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product and could have a material
adverse effect on us. In addition, the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions may require additional clinical or nonclinical studies, which could result in increased costs and
significant development delays. While all or a portion of these additional costs may be covered by payments under our collaborative agreements, we bear all of the costs for our development candidates
that are not partnered.

IF DELAYS IN PATIENT ENROLLMENT SLOW OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS WE MAY LOSE OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OR BE UNABLE TO BRING OUR DRUGS TO MARKET.

The rate of completion of clinical trials of our products is dependent upon, among other factors, the rate of patient accrual. Patient accrual is a function of
many factors, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the level of compliance by the clinical sites to
clinical trial protocols, and the availability of clinical trial material.


Delays
in patient enrollment in clinical trials may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which could have a material adverse effect on us. While all or a portion of these additional
costs may be covered by payments under our collaborative agreements, we bear all of the costs for our development candidates that are not partnered. If our clinical trials are not completed, we may
not be able to submit a new drug application. If we are able to file a new drug application, such application may not be reviewed and approved in a timely manner, if at all.

IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR OUR PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS, OR AT ALL, OUR REVENUES WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

The FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products through lengthy
and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Satisfaction of these requirements typically can take many
years and may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. Data obtained from preclinical, nonclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to
varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based on changes in, or additions to, regulatory policies for
drug approval during the period of product development and regulatory review. The effect of government regulation may be to delay or prevent the commencement of planned clinical trials for our drug
candidates in clinical development, including merimepodib, VX-385, VX-950, VX-765 and VX-702. It may also delay or prevent the commercialization of our products, including Lexiva (which is not yet
approved in the European Union), which are developed and submitted for approval, for a considerable period of time, impose costly procedures upon our activities and provide competitive advantages to
companies more experienced in regulatory affairs that compete with us. Moreover, even if approval is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be
marketed.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS FOR RESEARCH SUPPORT AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FUND OUR
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.

Our collaborative partners have agreed to fund portions of our research and development programs and/or to conduct certain research and development relating to
specified products. In exchange, we have given them technology, product and marketing rights relating to those products. Some of our corporate partners, including Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline and
Aventis, have rights to control the planning and execution of product development and clinical programs. Our collaborative partners may exercise their control rights in ways that may negatively impact
the timing and success of those programs. Our collaborations are subject to termination rights by the collaborators. If any of Aventis, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline or Serono were to terminate its
relationship with us, or fail to meet its contractual obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to undertake research, to fund related and other programs and to develop,
manufacture and market any products that may have resulted from the collaboration. We expect to seek additional collaborative arrangements to provide research support and to develop and commercialize
our products in the future. For example, a significant portion of our overall research effort is conducted under our collaboration with Novartis in the kinase field. That collaboration will end by its
terms in April 2006. If we are unable to enter into collaborative arrangements which would extend or replace the Novartis collaboration, or to find other means of financing the effort currently
devoted to the Novartis collaboration, our ability to conduct our research, development and commercial activities could be adversely affected to a material degree. Even if we are able to establish
acceptable collaborative arrangements in the future, they may not be successful. Under certain of our collaborative agreements, our collaborators have agreed to provide funding for only a portion of
our research and development activities and we are committed to investing our own capital to fund the remainder of the agreed upon programs. However, we may not have adequate financial resources to
satisfy those requirements.


IF WE LOSE OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE.

We believe that our integrated drug discovery capability gives us a technological advantage over our competitors. However, the pharmaceutical research field is
characterized by rapid technological progress and intense competition. As a result, we may not realize the expected benefits from these technologies. For example, a large pharmaceutical company, with
significantly more resources than we have, could pursue a novel, systematic approach to discover drugs based on gene families using proprietary drug targets, compound libraries, compound approaches,
structural protein analysis and information technologies. Such a company might identify broadly applicable compound classes faster and more effectively than we do, impeding our ability to develop and
market drugs based on our approach. Further, we believe that interest in the application of structure-based drug design, parallel drug design and related approaches has accelerated as the strategies
have become more widely understood. Businesses, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are conducting research to develop technologies that
may compete with those we use. It is possible that our competitors could acquire or develop technologies that would render our
technology obsolete or noncompetitive. For example, a competitor could develop information technologies that accelerate the atomic-level analysis of potential compounds that bind to the active site of
a drug target, and predict the absorption, toxicity, and relative ease-of-synthesis of candidate compounds. If we were unable to access the same technologies at an acceptable
price, our business could be adversely affected.

IF OUR COMPETITORS BRING SUPERIOR PRODUCTS TO MARKET OR BRING THEIR PRODUCTS TO MARKET BEFORE WE DO, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

Our products in development may not be able to compete effectively with products which are currently on the market or new products that may be developed by
others. There are many other companies developing products for the same indications that we are pursuing in development. For example, we know of at least 15 drugs in development for HIV, 15 drugs in
development for the treatment of hepatitis C infection, and 25 drugs in development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, by competitors in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries. In order to compete successfully in these areas, we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy and ease of manufacturing and gain market acceptance over competing products that have
received regulatory approval and are currently marketed. Many of our competitors, including major pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Abbott and Merck, have substantially
greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical testing and human clinical
trials of new pharmaceutical products, and in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for products more
rapidly than we do. If we obtain regulatory approval and launch commercial sales of our products, we will also compete with respect to manufacturing efficiency and sales and marketing capabilities,
areas in which we currently have limited experience.

THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF KEY EMPLOYEES OR THE FAILURE TO HIRE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND FUTURE GROWTH.

Because our products are highly technical in nature, we require the services of highly qualified and trained scientists who have the necessary skills to develop
our products. Our future success will depend in large part on the continued services of our key scientific and management personnel, including Dr. Joshua Boger, our Chief Executive Officer, and
Dr. Vicki L. Sato, our President. While we have entered into employment agreements with Dr. Boger and Dr. Sato, they provide for termination by the employee upon six months'
notice.


We
face intense competition for our scientific personnel from our competitors, our collaborative partners and other companies throughout our industry. Moreover, the growth of local
biotechnology companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the Cambridge, MA area has increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical
fields, and the high cost of living in the Boston and San Diego areas makes it difficult to attract employees from other parts of the country. A failure to retain, as well as hire, train and
effectively integrate into our organization, a sufficient number of qualified scientists and professionals would negatively impact our business and our ability to grow our business. In addition, the
level of funding under certain of our collaborative agreements, in particular the Novartis collaboration, depends on the number of our scientists performing research under those agreements. If we
cannot hire and retain the required personnel, funding received under the agreements may be reduced.

IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH EFFECTIVELY, OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.

We expect that if our clinical candidates continue to progress in development, we continue to build our commercial organization and our drug discovery efforts
continue to generate drug candidates, we will require significant additional investment in personnel, management systems and resources. Our ability to commercialize our products, achieve our research
and development objectives, and satisfy our commitments under our collaboration agreements depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands and expand our internal organization to
accommodate additional anticipated growth. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.

WE DEPEND ON THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURERS, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN CONTRACT MANUFACTURING ON REASONABLE TERMS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCTS.

Our ability to conduct clinical trials and our ability to commercialize our potential products will depend, in part, on our ability to manufacture our products on
a large scale, either directly or through third parties, at a competitive cost and in accordance with FDA and other regulatory requirements. We have no experience in manufacturing pharmaceuticals or
other products, and we may not be able to develop such capabilities in the foreseeable future. In addition, some of our current corporate partners have manufacturing rights with respect to our
products under development. We are, therefore, dependent on third party manufacturers and our collaborative partners for the production of our drug candidates for preclinical research, clinical trial
purposes and commercial production. Accordingly, if we are not able to obtain contract manufacturing from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to conduct or
complete clinical trials or commercialize our products as planned. Further, commercial formulation and manufacturing processes have yet to be developed for our drug candidates other than Agenerase and
Lexiva. As a result, our collaborators or we may encounter difficulties developing commercial formulations and manufacturing processes for our drug candidates that could result in delays in clinical
trials, regulatory submissions, regulatory approvals and commercialization of our products.

IF OUR PATENTS DO NOT PROTECT OUR PRODUCTS, OR OUR PRODUCTS INFRINGE THIRD-PARTY PATENTS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES.

We have numerous patent applications pending in the United States, as well as foreign counterparts in other countries. Our success will depend, in significant
part, on our ability to obtain and maintain United States and foreign patent protection for our products, their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing
the proprietary rights of third parties. We do not know whether any patents will issue from any of our patent applications or, even if patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide
us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be valuable commercially. Legal standards relating to the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims in the
biopharmaceutical field are still evolving, and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims in biopharmaceutical


patents
or the effect of prior art on them. If we are not able to obtain adequate patent protection, our ability to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products will be
limited. Furthermore, our activities may infringe the claims of patents held by third parties. Defense and prosecution of infringement or other intellectual property claims, as well as participation
in other inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and time-consuming, even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us. If the outcome of any such litigation or proceeding
were adverse, we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties, could be required to obtain licenses from third parties or could be required to cease sales of affected products, any of
which outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.

WE EXPECT TO INCUR FUTURE LOSSES AND WE MAY NEVER BECOME PROFITABLE.

We have incurred significant operating losses each year since our inception and expect to incur a significant operating loss in 2004. We believe that operating
losses will continue beyond 2004, even if we receive significant future payments under our existing and future collaborative agreements, because we are planning to make significant investments in
research and development, and will incur significant selling, general, and administrative expenses for our potential products. We expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to
year, and that such fluctuations may be substantial. We cannot predict when the Company will become profitable, if at all.

WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.

We expect to incur substantial research and development and related supporting expenses as we design and develop existing and future compounds and undertake
clinical trials of potential drugs resulting from such compounds. We also expect to incur substantial administrative and commercialization
expenditures in the future and substantial expenses related to the filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims. We anticipate that we will finance
these substantial cash needs with:

•

cash
received from our existing collaborative agreements;

•

cash
received from new collaborative agreements;

•

Agenerase
and Lexiva royalty revenue;

•

existing
cash reserves, together with interest earned on those reserves; and

•

future
product sales to the extent that we market products directly.

We
expect that funds from these sources will be sufficient to fund our planned activities for at least the next 18 months. If not, it will be necessary to raise additional funds
through public offerings or private placements of equity or debt securities or other methods of financing. Any equity financings could result in dilution to our then-existing
securityholders. Any debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that, among other things, restrict our ability to pay dividends and interest (although we do not intend to pay dividends for
the foreseeable future). The required interest payments associated with any significant additional debt financing could materially adversely impact our ability to service our convertible subordinated
notes and convertible senior subordinated notes. The terms of any additional debt financing may also, under certain circumstances, restrict or prohibit us from making interest payments on our
convertible subordinated notes and convertible senior subordinated notes. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research,
drug discovery or development programs, including clinical trials, or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to
certain of our technologies or products in research or development. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.


OUR SALES AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE IS LIMITED.

We have little experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products. We must either develop a marketing and sales force or enter into arrangements with
third parties to market and sell any of our product candidates which are approved by the FDA. We do not know whether we will be able to enter into marketing and sales agreements with others on
acceptable terms, if at all. We may not be able to successfully develop our own sales and marketing force for drug candidates for which we have retained marketing or co-promotion rights.
If we develop our own marketing and sales capability, we may be competing with other companies that currently have experienced and well-funded marketing and sales operations. We have
granted exclusive marketing rights for Agenerase and Lexiva to GlaxoSmithKline worldwide (except for amprenavir in Japan), and for pralnacasan to Aventis worldwide. Kissei has exclusive marketing
rights to Prozei (amprenavir) and VX-702 in Japan. Even though we retain some co-promotion rights, to the extent that our collaborative partners have commercial rights to our
products, any revenues we receive from those products will depend primarily on the sales and marketing efforts of others.

IF WE INCUR PRODUCT LIABILITY EXPENSES, OUR EARNINGS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

Our business will expose us to potential product liability risks that arise from the testing, manufacturing and sales of our products. In addition to direct
expenditures for damages, settlement and defense costs, there is the possibility of adverse publicity as a result of product liability claims. These risks will increase as our products receive
regulatory approval and are commercialized. We currently carry $15 million of product liability insurance. This level of insurance may not be sufficient. Moreover, we may not be able to
maintain our existing levels of insurance or be able to obtain or maintain additional insurance that we may need in the future on acceptable terms.

In
addition, our research and development activities may from time to time involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials.
Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state and local laws governing the use, handling and disposal of these materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of
hazardous materials comply with regulatory requirements, we cannot completely eliminate the risk that accidental contamination or injury from these materials could expose us to significant liability.

WE HAVE ADOPTED ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS THAT MAY FRUSTRATE ANY ATTEMPT TO REMOVE OR REPLACE OUR CURRENT MANAGEMENT.

Our corporate charter and by-law provisions and stockholder rights plan may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential
change of control of Vertex which might be beneficial to the company or its securityholders. Our charter provides for staggered terms for the members of the Board of Directors. Our by-laws
grant the directors a right to adjourn
annual meetings of stockholders, and certain provisions of the by-laws may be amended only with an 80% stockholder vote. Pursuant to our stockholder rights plan, each share of common stock
has an associated preferred share purchase right. The rights will not trade separately from the common stock until, and are exercisable only upon, the acquisition or the potential acquisition through
tender offer by a person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. We may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without stockholder approval and upon such
terms as our Board of Directors may determine. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of
preferred stock that may be issued in the future. As a result, shareholders or other parties may find it more difficult to remove or replace our current management.

OUR STOCK PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE BASED ON FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

Market prices for securities of companies such as Vertex are highly volatile. Within the 12 months ended December 31, 2003, our common stock traded
between $7.83 and $18.75. The market for our


stock,
like that of other companies in the biotechnology field, has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our operating performance. The future
market price of our securities could be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as:

•

announcements
of results of clinical or nonclinical trials;

•

announcements
of financial results and other operating performance measures, or capital structuring activities;

•

technological
innovations or the introduction of new products by our competitors;

•

government
regulatory action;

•

public
concern as to the safety of products developed by others;

•

developments
in patent or other intellectual property rights or announcements relating to these matters;

•

developments
in domestic and international governmental policy or regulation, for example relating to intellectual property rights; and

•

developments
and market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks, in general.

OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR REDUCE OUR FLEXIBILITY TO ACT IN OUR BEST INTERESTS.

As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $333.5 in long-term debt, including $315 million of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due
September 2007. In a transaction completed on February 13, 2004, we exchanged $153.1 million of these notes for $153.1 million of 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated
Notes due September 2011. The high level of our indebtedness will impact us by:

•

exposing
us to fixed rates of interest which may be in excess of prevailing market rates;

•

making
it more difficult to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;

•

constraining
our ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic climate or to changes in our business, or the pharmaceutical industry; and

•

requiring
the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow to service of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for
other purposes.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RESTRUCTURE OUR KENDALL SQUARE LEASE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, WE COULD BE OBLIGATED TO PAY AS MUCH AS THE FULL AMOUNT DUE UNDER THE LEASE, AS AND
WHEN DUE UNDER THE LEASE AGREEMENT.

We
have decided not to occupy the Kendall Square facility, which we lease under a 15-year agreement expiring in 2018. We have estimated our liability to restructure the lease, using
assumptions and estimates we consider appropriate, to be $69.5 million as of December 31, 2003. In estimating the liability, we considered several possible outcomes of the potential
lease restructuring, including a sublease of the entire space, a buy-out of our obligation, partial subleases by multiple parties, and other variations of these same outcomes. If we are unable to find
a tenant or tenants willing to sublease the facility on the terms we have incorporated into our estimate, including the rental rate, timing and term of any such sublease(s), or if the market for
specialized laboratory space in Cambridge, Massachusetts or other real estate fundamentals should change before we are able to secure a sublease of the space, or if any of our other assumptions and
estimates are inaccurate or circumstances bearing upon the potential restructuring should change before we are able to restructure the lease, or if we are unable to reach agreement with the landlord
on the terms of any such restructuring, our estimated liability could increase to as much as the full amount due under the lease. Our future obligations under the lease could be as much as
$312,500,000, as set forth in "Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Obligations at December 31, 2003" on page 40 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

We
lease an aggregate of approximately 624,000 square feet of laboratory and office space in eight facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The leases have expiration dates ranging from
2005 to 2018. We have the option to extend the lease for our headquarters facility at 130 Waverly Street, Cambridge, for up to two additional terms, ending in 2015 with respect to one portion of the
building, and in 2019 for the other portion of the building. The lease for the laboratory and office building adjacent to our headquarters will expire in 2010 with the option to extend the lease for
up to two additional consecutive ten year terms. The lease for our Kendall Square building, which is currently unoccupied, will expire in 2018, with the option to extend the lease for two consecutive
terms of 10 years each. The building is currently under construction and we are obligated to build out finished space to specifications approved by our landlord. We have decided not to occupy
the Kendall Square building and are actively trying to restructure the lease obligation. We are considering several possible outcomes for the potential restructuring, including a sublease of the
entire space, a buy-out of our obligation, partial subleases by multiple parties and other variations of these same outcomes. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Contractual Commitments and Obligations" at page 39.

We
also lease approximately 81,200 square feet of laboratory and office space in San Diego, California. The lease for this space will expire on August 31, 2008, with an option to
extend for up to two additional terms of five years each. We also sublease an additional 12,500 square feet of space for our administrative functions in a nearby facility. The sublease for this
additional space will expire on March 31, 2004 and we are consolidating activities in our larger facility.

We
lease approximately 22,000 square feet of laboratory and office space in Milton Park, Abingdon, England, under a lease expiring in 2013, with a right of early termination in 2008, for
our U.K. business and research and development activities.

We
believe our facilities are adequate for our current needs. We believe we can obtain additional space on commercially reasonable terms.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We were involved in a lawsuit filed against us in December 2001 by Oregon Heath Sciences University in the District Court of Oregon. The complaint in the suit
sought to name Dr. Bruce Gold, an employee of Oregon Health Sciences University, as an inventor and Oregon Health Sciences University as part owner of five of our neurophilin patents, and associated
damages. The suit stemmed from assays run on Vertex compounds by Dr. Gold under a sponsored research agreement in 1996. That lawsuit was settled on December 12, 2003 in connection with the
establishment of a collaboration between Vertex and OHSU, under which we will fund scientific research by OHSU scientists in areas of mutual interest. We do not expect that the settlement terms will
have a material impact on the Company's financial position.

On
September 23, 2003, two purported shareholder class actions,

Carlos Marcano v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, et al.

and

City of Dearborn Heights General Governmental Employees'
Retirement System v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, et al.

, were filed in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming the Company and certain current and former officers and employees of the Company as defendants. Those actions were followed by three additional
lawsuits,

Stephen Anish v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, et al.

,

William Johns v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, et
al.

, and

Ben Harrington v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, et al.

, also filed in the District of Massachusetts. All five cases contain
substantially identical allegations and have been consolidated by the District Court into one lawsuit. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of
material fact regarding VX-745, an investigational agent with potential in the treatment of inflammatory and neurological diseases, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10(b)(5). The plaintiffs seek certification as a class action, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, and


unspecified
equitable or injunctive relief. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to contest them vigorously.

We
are not a party to any litigation in any court with any governmental authority, and management is not aware of any contemplated proceeding by any governmental authority against the
Company.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.

On

July 18,
 2001, we completed a merger with Aurora Biosciences Corporation. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests. All prior period consolidated
financial statements presented have been restated to include the consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Aurora Biosciences Corporation as though the merger had been
in effect on the dates indicated.

(1)

In
the third quarter of 2001, in connection with our overall review of accounting policies concurrent with our merger with Aurora, we elected to change our revenue recognition policy
for collaborative research and development revenues from the Emerging Issues Task Force No. 91-6 (EITF 91-6) method to the Substantive Milestone Method, adopted
retroactive to January 1, 2001. We believe this method is preferable because it is reflective of the Company's on-going business operations and is more consistent with the industry
practices following the implementation of SAB 101 in 2000 throughout the biotechnology industry. For further information please refer to Note C: "Change in Accounting
Principle—Revenue Recognition" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(2)

In
the fourth quarter of 2000, we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition in conjunction with our adoption of the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
"Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" which was retroactive to January 1, 2000.

(3)

During
2001, we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of Derivative Implementation Group Issue No. A17 ("DIG A17") in connection with
the valuation of derivative instruments. Please refer to Note I: "Investments" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
further information.

(4)

We
sold certain assets and liabilities of our Discovery Tools and Services business in two independent transactions in March and December 2003. In October 2001 the FASB
issued FASB 144 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"). Pursuant to SFAS 144 the Statement of Operations data shown above give effect to the
disposition of the assets sold, accounting for such assets as discontinued operations. Please refer to Note D: "Sale of Assets" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

(5)

In
February 2004, we exchanged approximately $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 for approximately $153.1 million in
aggregate principal amount of newly issued 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011.


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We
are a biotechnology company in the business of discovering, developing, and marketing small molecule drugs for serious diseases including HIV infection, chronic hepatitis C virus
infection, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders and cancer, independently and with collaborators. To date, we have discovered and advanced two products that have reached the market, Agenerase
(amprenavir) and Lexiva (fosamprenavir calcium). Agenerase was approved and launched in the United States in early 1999, and Lexiva was approved and launched in the United States in late 2003. We earn
a royalty on the sales of Agenerase and Lexiva and co-promote these products in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. Our drug candidate pipeline is principally focused on the development
and commercialization of new treatments for viral and inflammatory diseases. We have built a drug discovery capability that integrates advanced biology, chemistry, biophysics, automation and
information technologies, with a goal of making the drug discovery process more efficient and productive.

Drug Discovery and Development

Discovery and development of a single new pharmaceutical product is a lengthy and resource-intensive process which may take 10 to 15 years or more. During this
process, potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluation, driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations, designed to generate information concerning toxicity profiles, efficacy,
proper dosage levels and a variety of other characteristics which are important in determining whether a proposed drug candidate should be approved for marketing. Most chemical compounds which are
investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into formal development, and most drug candidates which do advance into formal development never become commercial products.

We
have a variety of drug candidates in clinical development and a broad-based drug discovery effort. Given the uncertainties of the research and development process, it is not possible
to predict with confidence which, if any, of these efforts will result in a marketable pharmaceutical product. We constantly monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical and
clinical trials and regularly evaluate and re-evaluate our portfolio investments with the objective of balancing risk and potential return in view of new data and scientific, business and commercial
insights. This process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information comes to light and we gain new insights into ongoing programs.

Business Strategy

We have elected to diversify our research and development activities across a relatively broad array of investment opportunities, due in part to the high risks
associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical business. We focus our efforts both on programs which we expect to control throughout the development and commercialization process, and programs
which we expect will be conducted in the development and commercial phase principally by a collaborative partner. Since we have incurred losses from our inception and expect to incur losses for the
forseeable future, our business strategy is dependent in large part on our continued ability to raise significant funding to finance our operations and meet our long term contractual commitments and
obligations. In the past, we have secured funds principally through capital market transactions, strategic collaborative agreements, proceeds from the disposition of assets, investment income and the
issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs. At December 31, 2003 we had $583 million of cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities and $315 million of 5%
Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 (the "2007 Notes"). During 2003 and early 2004 we took a number of steps to address our cash position and investment requirements in support of our existing
business strategy.


Debt Exchange.

On February 13, 2004, we exchanged approximately $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of
our 2007 Notes for approximately $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of newly issued 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 (the "2011 Notes"). This transaction had an
effect of significantly deferring the repayment date for almost half of our outstanding debt.

Sale of Business.

In two independent transactions closed in March and December 2003, we sold the assets of our Discovery
Tools and Services business for an aggregate of $101 million of cash and the assumption of certain liabilities, to Invitrogen Corporation ("Invitrogen") and to a company organized by Telegraph
Hill Partners, respectively. As a result of the disposition of the Discovery Tools and Services business, we now operate in a single operating segment: Pharmaceuticals.

Novartis Restructuring.

In January 2004, we amended our existing collaboration agreement with Novartis. We will continue to
receive research funding through April 2006, consistent with the original agreement, and up to $35 million in pre-commercial payments for each preclinical drug candidate which we propose
and Novartis accepts for preclinical development. We will no longer be responsible for the early development of drug candidates through proof-of-concept, as required under the original agreement,
except that we may elect to develop VX-680 under the terms of the original agreement. We believe the restructured agreement remains financially attractive for us, and we are now free to devote our
internal development resources to Vertex-controlled compounds in our areas of principal therapeutic interest.

Rebalancing of Research and Development

During 2003, we elected to focus our internal development and commercialization activity on two principal areas for the intermediate term: viral and inflammatory
diseases. Our most advanced drug candidates in these areas are merimepodib (HCV), VX-950 (HCV) and VX-765 (inflammatory diseases). In preparation for advancing these and other Vertex-controlled drug
candidates, we restructured our operations during the second half of the year to rebalance our relative investment in research, development and commercialization. This restructuring included a
workforce reduction and a decision not to occupy our Kendall Square facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Of the terminated employees, 59% were from research, 30% were from sales, general and
administrative functions primarily supporting research, and 11% were from development. Our investment in Company-sponsored research declined during 2003 approximately 22% from 2002 levels, while our
investment in Company-sponsored development during 2003 increased over 2002 levels by approximately 57%. Collaborator-sponsored research increased approximately 14% while our Collaborator-sponsored
development declined in 2003 by 44%. Overall we expect our total research and development investment in 2004 to be comparable to 2003, with any increases, if any, resulting principally from activities
funded in whole or in part by new collaborators.

Collaborative Revenue

Collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy going forward.

We
currently have significant collaborations with Novartis, Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline, and Serono. In these collaborations, we have retained a share of downstream product revenue and may
be entitled to significant pre-commercial milestone payments as drug candidates progress in development. We currently receive research funding from Novartis and Serono, and we currently have drug
candidates in clinical development and commercialization under the collaborations with GlaxoSmithKline and Aventis and under a collaboration with Kissei. In 2003 we realized $69.1 million in
royalties and collaborative revenue, all of which was earned under our pharmaceutical partnerships. This represented a significant decline from the 2002 level of $94.8 million and reflected the
conclusion of funding from our collaborations with Lilly, Taisho and Schering AG and our lack of any new source of collaboration


revenue
since 2000. Our collaborations with Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline accounted for 64% and 17%, respectively, of our total revenue in 2003.

A
significant portion of our total research effort is being conducted under our collaboration with Novartis, which is scheduled to conclude, along with our research funding from
Novartis, in April 2006. Under the terms of our agreement with Novartis, we will retain all rights to the intellectual property which we generate during that collaboration, except for rights licensed
to Novartis in connection with the development and commercialization of specific preclinical drug candidates that Novartis accepts for development. Our access to these retained rights may help us
initiate other collaborative opportunities in the kinase inhibitor field if our collaboration with Novartis is not extended beyond 2006. We will need to seek those opportunities or other financing
alternatives in order to maintain our discovery effort at its existing level. It is not possible to predict at present whether any of those collaborations or other financing alternatives will be
available in 2006 and beyond.

Based
on the value that we believe we have built through research and development investments in certain of our drug discovery and development programs and our perception of the level of
interest in certain of our programs among some potential collaborators, we believe that we could enter into additional collaborative agreements in 2004 which could be material to our business. Our
business development priorities include new collaborations to support development and commercialization, in Europe and Japan, of our HCV clinical candidates and our oral cytokine inhibitor,
VX-765. Our product development pipeline also includes drug candidates that are outside our core therapeutic areas of viral and inflammatory diseases, such as VX-702 (acute
coronary syndromes), VX-944 (oncology) and VX-680 (oncology). In 2004 and future periods we expect to identify collaborative development and commercialization opportunities for
these drug candidates in order to continue their clinical advancement, as we maintain focus on our Company-sponsored opportunities. We are also seeking collaborators for our ion channels and other
discovery programs.

Lease Restructuring

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, we recorded restructuring and other related expenses of $91.8 million, of which $78.7 million relates to the
potential restructuring of our Kendall Square lease. The restructuring accrual remaining at December 31, 2003 was $69.5 million. The liability at
December 31, 2003 represents our best judgment of the assumptions and estimates most appropriate in measuring the outcome of the potential lease restructuring. Although it is possible that this
liability will be paid in full over the next 24 months, the actual amount and timing of any payments will depend on the actual terms of any lease restructuring transaction(s). If we are
successful in restructuring the lease, we could potentially be relieved of a future lease obligation of approximately $16 to $18 million per year and a contractual construction obligation which could
be in excess of $30 million through 2006.

Financial Guidance

The key financial measures for which we have provided guidance in 2004 are as follows:

•

Our
full year loss is expected to be between $140 and $150 million, before any gains or charges, including additional charges relating to the potential lease
restructuring and the convertible note debt exchange.

•

Total
revenue is expected to be in the range of $90 to $100 million in 2004. This is expected to be comprised of $60 to $65 million in committed funding and
milestones from existing collaborative partners, and $15 to $18 million from HIV product royalties. In addition, we are currently in discussions with pharmaceutical companies regarding
strategic research and product development agreements, and the successful conclusion of such discussions may result in additional revenue and cash flow in 2004.


•

As
we prioritize our investment toward proprietary drug candidates and realize the benefits from the operational restructuring in drug discovery during 2003, we anticipate
that research and development expenses will be in the range of $190 to $205 million for the full year of 2004.

•

We
expect sales, general and administrative expenses to be between $38 and $43 million in 2004.

•

We
expect cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities to be in excess of $350 million at the end of 2004.

The
financial measures set forth above are forward looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially, as referenced in the section
below entitled "Forward-Looking Statements."

obligations from 2007 to 2011.

Commitments and Obligations Recorded on the Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003:

Capital leases relate to equipment leases that expire at various dates though June 2004.

The
collaborator development loans in the table above represent indebtedness to Novartis in the amount of $32,460,000 that was advanced under a loan facility established pursuant to the
original collaboration agreement with Novartis. Loans under the facility were intended to fund early clinical studies of kinase inhibitor compounds that we selected for early development. In
February 2004, we amended the terms of the Novartis collaboration agreement. We will continue to be responsible for drug discovery and Novartis will continue to provide research funding through
the balance of the research term ending in April 2006, as provided in the original agreement. However, Novartis will now


be
responsible for all nonclinical and clinical development of drug candidates which it accepts for development, and consequently the loan facility providing funding for development activities by
Vertex has been terminated. We may either continue development of VX-680 under the terms of the original agreement using loan proceeds we have received under the Novartis loan facility, or elect to
develop and commercialize VX-680 independent of Novartis. If we elect to develop and commercialize VX-680 independent of Novartis, loan amounts with respect to that drug candidate which are unspent
and uncommitted at the time of our election will be repayable immediately. Outstanding loans which funded amounts either spent or committed to be spent on development activities relating to a
particular compound will be forgiven if that compound is selected by Novartis for development. If not, the related loan will be repayable without interest in May 2008. At December 31, 2003,
approximately $14 million in development loans previously advanced to us were unspent and uncommitted. Please refer to Note P to our consolidated financial statements included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

At
December 31, 2003 we had $315,000,000 in 2007 Notes. On February 13, 2004, we concluded an exchange of approximately $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount
of 2007 Notes for approximately $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of newly issued 2011 Notes. As a result of this transaction, the Company has outstanding $161.9 million in
aggregate principal amount of 2007 Notes and $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 2011 Notes. Our annual interest payment obligation increased by $1.1 million to
$16.9 million, reflecting the slightly higher coupon rate on the 2011 Notes.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Obligations at December 31, 2003:

At December 31, 2003, our future minimum commitments and contractual obligations included facilities operating leases, a purchase obligation and
contractual commitments related to our research and development programs. These items are not required to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheets under GAAP. They are disclosed in the table
presented above and described more fully in the following paragraphs in order to provide a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity at December 31, 2003.

Our
Kendall Square lease term began January 1, 2003 and lease payments commenced in May 2003. We have an obligation, staged over a number of years, to build out the space
into finished laboratory and office space. The lease will expire in 2018 with options to extend the lease for two consecutive terms of ten years each, ultimately expiring in 2038. In June 2003,
we decided not to occupy the space under this
lease and to attempt to restructure the lease. See Note E to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's future minimum commitments
under this lease including lease payments and a construction obligation are $29.2 million for less than 1 year, $68.4 million for 1 to 3 years, $38.7 million for 3 to 5 years and $176.2
million for 5 years or more and are included in the table above.

Commitments
under research and development programs represent contractual commitments entered into for materials and services in the normal course of business.

The
purchase obligations referred to above include an agreement to purchase a minimum of $3 million of certain specified products from Invitrogen annually for three years after
the completion of the sale of certain assets of the Discovery Tools and Services business on March 28, 2003.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have incurred operating losses since our inception and have historically financed our operations principally through public stock offerings, private placements
of our equity and debt securities, strategic collaborative agreements, which include research and development funding, milestones and royalties on the sales of products, proceeds from disposition of
assets of our Discovery Tools and Services business, investment income and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs.


At
December 31, 2003 we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $583,164,000, which is a decrease of $51,820,000 from $634,984,000 at December 31, 2002. The
decrease of $51,820,000 is primarily the result of cash used by operations of $167,623,000 offset by the net cash consideration received from the sale of the assets of the Discovery Tools and Services
business of approximately $96,561,000. Additionally, expenditures for property and equipment were $17,351,000, cash receipts from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit programs were
approximately $11,959,000 and we drew down $27,460,000 under the Novartis loan facility in 2003, bringing the balance outstanding under the loan facility to $32,460,000 at December 31, 2003.

As
part of our strategy to manage our long term operational cash needs, in early 2004 we exchanged approximately $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2007 Notes for
approximately $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of newly issued 2011 Notes. The 2011 Notes were issued through a private offering to qualified institutional buyers. The 2011 Notes
are convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a price equal to $14.94, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2007 Notes are convertible, at the option of the
holder, into common stock at a price equal to $92.26.

The
restructuring accrual remaining at December 31, 2003 of $69.5 million, relating to the potential Kendall Square lease restructuring, could possibly be paid in full over
the next 24 months. However, the actual amount and timing of such payments will be dependent upon the ultimate terms of any lease restructuring. We review our estimates underlying the
restructuring accrual on at least a quarterly basis, and the accrual could change with any future change in our estimates.

We
expect to continue to invest significantly in our pipeline, particularly in clinical trials of merimepodib, VX-950 and VX-765, and in our ion channel and kinase discovery efforts.
Consequently, we expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and commercialize existing and future drug candidates. We also expect to
incur substantial administrative expenditures in the future and expenses related to filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property rights. We expect our capital
expenditures to remain at levels consistent with 2003, and we expect to complete 2004 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in excess of $350 million.

Beyond
2004, the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements, including repayment of the 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes, will depend on many
factors, including the number, breadth and prospects of our discovery and development programs and the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates.
Collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy. We will continue to rely on cash receipts from our existing research and development collaborations,
including research funding, development reimbursements and potential milestone payments, and from new collaborations we may enter, in order to help fund our research and development efforts.

From
time to time during 2004, we may repurchase our existing 2007 Notes in privately negotiated transactions, or market purchases or otherwise, depending on market conditions. Any such
repurchases may be material.

To
the extent that our current cash and marketable securities, in addition to the above-mentioned sources, are not sufficient to fund our activities, it will be necessary to raise
additional funds through public offerings or private placements of securities or other methods of financing. We will continue to manage our capital structure and consider financing opportunities to
strengthen our long term liquidity profile. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make


certain
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods. These items are constantly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material
changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.

We
believe that the application of the accounting policies for restructuring and other expenses, research and development expenses, and revenue recognition, all of which are important to
our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. Our accounting polices, including the ones discussed below, are more fully
described in Note B to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Restructuring and Other Expense

We record liabilities associated with restructuring activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred, in accordance with
SFAS 146 "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"). These estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted in subsequent periods. Adjustments are based,
among other things, on management's assessment of changes in factors underlying the estimates, the impact of which is measured using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate applied in the
initial period.

On
June 10, 2003, we announced a plan to restructure our operations in preparation for increased investment in the clinical development and commercialization of our drug
candidates. We designed the restructuring to rebalance our relative investment in research, development and commercialization, to better support our long-term objective of becoming an
integrated drug company. The restructuring included a workforce reduction, write-offs of certain assets and a decision not to occupy the Kendall Square facility. We are actively trying to
restructure the lease obligation.

As
a result of the Company's restructuring plan and in accordance with SFAS 146, we recorded an initial estimate of the fair value of the estimated liability in the second quarter
of 2003. We have reviewed our assumptions and estimates quarterly and updated the liability as changes in circumstances have required. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, we recorded
restructuring and other related expenses of $91.8 million. The $91.8 million includes $78.7 million of potential lease restructuring expense (of which $34.9 million,
$42.4 million and $1.4 million was recorded in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively). In addition to the $78.7 million, other costs included in the
$91.8 million charge include $6.0 million of lease operating expense incurred prior to the decision not to occupy the Kendall Square facility, $2.6 million for severance and
related employee transition benefits and $4.5 million for a write-off of leasehold improvements and other assets.

The
charge for the potential lease restructuring is the most significant component of the total restructuring charge and requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions. We use
probability weighted discounted cash flows in order to calculate the amount of the liability associated with the potential lease restructuring. In accordance with SFAS 146, we used a
credit-adjusted risk-free rate of approximately 10% in discounting our estimated cash flows. The probability weighted cash flows are based on management's assumptions and estimates
regarding the possible outcomes of the potential lease restructuring. In estimating the liability we considered several possible outcomes of the potential lease restructuring, including a sublease of
the entire space, a buy-out of our obligation, partial subleases by multiple parties, and other variations of these same outcomes. We also included in these potential outcomes the
contractually required commitment for build-out of the leased space. We validate our estimates and assumptions through consultations with independent third parties having relevant
expertise. We increased our estimated lease restructuring expense from the second quarter to the third quarter by $42.4 million, based on our judgment that a significant decline in the real
estate


market
in Cambridge, Massachusetts had occurred. We believe an increase in available laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts and certain other factors led to a corresponding overall
decline in real estate market fundamentals from the previous quarter. Accordingly, we revised our expectations of attainable sublease terms, assuming lower sublease rental rates and a delay in
occupancy by potential subtenants.

It
is possible that our estimates and assumptions will change in the future resulting in additional adjustments to the amount of the liability, and the effect of such adjustments could
be material. For example, if sublease rental rates differ from our assumption by approximately 10% in either direction, our recorded liability will be negatively or positively adjusted by
approximately $8 million. If the time to finalize the restructuring is delayed by six months from our estimated completion date, the impact could be as high as approximately $10 million
in additional liability, or more if there is further delay. We will review our assumptions and judgments related to the potential lease restructuring on at least a quarterly basis, until the outcome
is finalized, and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary, based on our best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements," as amended by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," and for revenue arrangements entered into after June 30, 2003, Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables" ("EITF 00-21").

Our
collaborative and other research and development revenue is generated primarily through collaborative research and development agreements with strategic partners. The terms of these
agreements typically include non-refundable up-front license fees, funding of research and development efforts, payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and
royalties on product sales.

We
recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front license fees and milestones, not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, ratably over the contracted
or estimated period of performance. Changes in estimates could impact revenue in the period the estimate is changed. If our estimate of the period of performance shortens or lengthens, the amount of
revenue we recognize from non-refundable, up-front license fees and milestones could increase or decrease in the period the change in estimate becomes known. Future related
revenues would be adjusted accordingly. To date, changes to our estimates have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Research funding is recognized ratably over
the period of effort, as earned. Milestones that are based on designated achievement points and that are considered at risk and substantive at the inception of the collaborative contract, are
recognized as earned when the corresponding payment is considered reasonably assured. We evaluate whether milestones are at risk and substantive based on the contingent nature of the milestone,
specifically reviewing factors such as the technological and commercial risk that must be overcome and the level of investment required.

Under
EITF 00-21, in multiple element arrangements, license payments are recognized together with any up-front payment and the research and development funding as a single unit of
accounting, unless the delivered technology has stand-alone value to the customer and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements in the arrangement. License
payments received during the course of a collaboration that do not meet the separation criteria above are recognized, when earned, in proportion to the period of time completed on the contract
relative to the total contracted or estimated period of performance on the underlying research and development collaboration, with the remaining amount deferred and recognized ratably over the
remaining period of performance. Payments received after performance obligations are complete are recognized when earned. We did not receive any license payments in 2003.

Royalty
revenue is recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories, as provided by our collaborative partner, and is recognized in the
period the sales


occur.
Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues, which have not been historically significant, are reconciled and adjusted for in the quarter they become known.

Research and Development Costs

All research and development costs, including amounts funded by research and development collaborations, are expensed as incurred. Research and development
expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead costs, clinical trial costs, contract services
and other outside costs. Clinical trial, contract services and other outside costs require that we make estimates of the costs incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at period end
as the third party service periods and billing terms do not always coincide with our period end. We base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for
the period, past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract where applicable.

Results of Operations

The following discussion of revenues and expenses is based only on the results of our continuing operations. We sold the assets of the Discovery Tools and
Services business in two independent transactions in March and December 2003. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS
No. 144"), the results of operations associated with the assets sold have been reclassified on the consolidated financial statements under the heading "discontinued operations" for all periods
presented. The reclassification of the amounts to discontinued operations have been prepared using estimates and assumptions we have deemed appropriate based upon the information currently available.
Prior to 2002, the Discovery Tools and Services business was not separately managed operationally or financially and therefore, we have estimated certain operating expenses, based on certain
assumptions, including relative costs of the business being sold compared to historical site costs. Amounts reclassified to discontinued operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that
would have been achieved had the Discovery Tools and Services business operated on a stand-alone basis during the periods presented.

As
a result of the disposition of these assets, we now operate in a single operating segment: Pharmaceuticals.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2002

Our net loss for 2003 was $196,767,000 or $2.56 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss for 2002 of $108,621,000 or $1.43 per basic and diluted
common share. Our loss in 2003 includes restructuring and other expense of $91,824,000 and income from discontinued operations of $69,646,000. Included in the income from discontinued operations is a
gain from the sale of assets of $70,339,000. Included in our net loss for 2002 was income from discontinued operations of $28,337,000.

In
addition to restructuring and other expense, offset by income from discontinued operations, our net loss for 2003 as compared with our net loss for 2002 increased primarily as a
result of decreased revenue and interest income.

Total
revenues decreased to $69,141,000 in 2003 compared to $94,770,000 in 2002. In 2003, revenue was comprised of $9,002,000 in royalties and $60,139,000 in collaborative and other
research and development revenue, as compared with $10,054,000 in royalties and $84,716,000 in collaborative research and development revenue in 2002.

Royalties
consist primarily of Agenerase royalty revenue. Agenerase royalty revenue is based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of Agenerase. We began earning royalties on sales
of Lexiva in the United States in November 2003. We expect to receive marketing approval for Lexiva in the European Union in 2004. We pay a royalty to a third party on sales of Agenerase and Lexiva.


Collaborative
and other research and development revenue decreased $24,577,000 or 29% in 2003 as compared with 2002. The decrease in collaborative and other research and development
revenue is due to the conclusion of certain of our collaborative research and development arrangements, mainly in late 2002, partially offset by additional revenue recognized under our Novartis
collaboration and a milestone payment received from GlaxoSmithKline in connection with FDA approval of Lexiva. The table presented below is a summary of significant revenue arrangements for the year
ended 2003 as compared with the year ended 2002.

We
have not entered into any significant collaborative research and development agreements since 2000. Additionally as shown in the table above, research funding under our partnerships
with Eli Lilly, Schering and Taisho concluded in 2002.

We
expect that collaborative and other research and development revenues will continue to be a significant source of our total revenues and we believe we could enter into additional
collaborative agreements in 2004 which could be material to our business.

Research
and development expenses remained relatively consistent at $199,636,000 in 2003 compared to $198,338,000 in 2002. Research expenditures were $113,435,000 in 2003 compared with
$120,406,000 in 2002. Development expenditures were $86,201,000 in 2003 compared with $77,932,000 in 2002. Our investment in research has decreased due to the operational restructuring in
June 2003 while our investment in development has increased as a result of our proprietary drug candidates entering and advancing through clinical development. In 2003 our clinical trials
focused on multiple drug candidates. The results of these trials enabled us to focus our clinical pipeline on two core therapeutic areas—viral and inflammatory diseases. Our lead drug
candidates in these areas are merimepodib (HCV), VX-950 (HCV) and VX-765 (inflammatory diseases). In 2003 our development investment also focused on drug candidates with
potential therapeutic indications outside our current core therapeutic areas, such as VX-702 (acute coronary syndromes), VX-148 (autoimmune diseases), VX-944
(oncology) and VX-680 (oncology). In 2004 and future periods we will seek to identify licensing opportunities for these drug candidates in order to continue their clinical development. We
continue to focus our main drug discovery efforts on the protein kinase and ion channel gene families as well as other targeted areas.


Our collaborative partners have agreed to fund portions of our research and development programs related to specified drug candidates. Our research and development expenses for 2003,
2002 and 2001 were as follows:

To date we have incurred in excess of $1 billion in research and development costs associated with drug discovery and development. We
expect research and development expenses in 2004 to remain comparable with 2003. However, our anticipated 2004 research and development expenses could vary materially, depending on the occurrence and
timing of clinical trials. We anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we add personnel and capabilities to support the advancement of our lead drug
candidates. However, we do not expect that our research expenses will increase significantly unless we obtain a significant amount of funding from new collaborations.


We
estimate that it takes 10 to 15 years (the industry average is 12 years) to discover, develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the U.S. as outlined
below:

Phase:

Objective:

Estimated

Duration:

Discovery

Lead identification and target validation

2 to 4 years

Pre-Clinical

Initial toxicology for preliminary identification of risks for humans; gather early pharmacokinetic data

1 to 2 years

Phase I

Evaluate safety in humans; study how the drug works, metabolizes and interacts with other drugs

1 to 2 years

Phase II

Establish effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage; continue safety evaluation

2 to 4 years

Phase III

Confirm efficacy, dosage regime and safety profile of the drug

2 to 4 years

FDA approval

Approval by the FDA to sell and market the drug under approved labeling

6 months to 2 years

Animal
and other nonclinical studies are typically conducted during each phase of human clinical studies.

The
successful development of our products is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk factors. The duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type,
complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. The FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products
through lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Data obtained from preclinical, nonclinical and
clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation of development. Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations,
which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The duration and the cost related to discovery, preclinical, nonclinical and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project
and are difficult to predict. Therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available. The most significant costs associated with
drug discovery and development are those costs associated with Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. Given the uncertainties related to development, we are currently unable to reliably
estimate when, if ever, our drug candidates will generate revenue and cash flows. We do not expect to receive net cash inflows from any major discovery and development products until a drug candidate
becomes a profitable commercial product.

Sales,
general and administrative expenses decreased $1,974,000, or 5%, to $39,082,000 in 2003 from $41,056,000 in 2002, due primarily to a reduction in personnel resulting from our
consolidation of certain general and administration functions to our corporate office location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and from our restructuring in the second quarter of 2003.

Restructuring
and other expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was $91.8 million. The activity related to restructuring and other expense for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2003, is presented below (in thousands):

In
accordance with SFAS 146, we review on a quarterly basis the estimates and assumptions underlying our determination of the anticipated liability associated with
the potential lease restructuring and adjust the liability as changes in circumstances require. It is possible that those estimates and assumptions could change in the future resulting in incremental
expense or, alternatively, in reversal of expense, and the effect of any such adjustments could be material.

Interest
income decreased approximately $13,310,000 to $15,412,000 in 2003 from $28,722,000 in 2002. The decrease is mainly the result of both a lower level of invested funds and lower
portfolio yields due to a reduced interest rate environment.

Income
from discontinued operations increased $69,646,000 in 2003 from $28,337,000 in 2002, due to our sale of the assets of our Discovery Tools and Services business in 2003. Included
in the income from discontinued operations in 2003 is a gain on the sale of those assets of $70,339,000.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2001

Our net loss for 2002 was $108,621,000 or $1.43 per basic and diluted common share compared to a net loss of $66,233,000 or $0.89 per basic and diluted common
share for 2001. The net loss for 2002 includes income from discontinued operations of $28,337,000. The net loss for 2001 includes income from discontinued operations of $22,148,000, a charge of
$25,901,000 representing a cumulative change in accounting principle related to revenue recognition and a gain of $17,749,000 representing a cumulative change in accounting related to derivative
instruments.

Total
revenues increased to $94,770,000 in 2002 compared to $85,297,000 in 2001. In 2002, revenue was comprised of $10,054,000 in royalties and $84,716,000 in collaborative and other
research and development revenue, as compared with $10,783,000 in royalties and $74,514,000 in collaborative and other research and development revenue in 2001.

Collaborative
and other research and development revenue increased $10,202,000 or 14% in 2002 as compared with 2001. The table presented below is a summary of significant revenue
arrangements for the year ended 2002 as compared with the year ended 2001. As illustrated in the table below the overall increase in collaborative and other research and development revenue in 2002 is
due to an increase in revenue recorded in connection with certan collaborations, such as Novartis and Eli Lilly, offset by a decrease in revenue earned under our arrangements with Kissei and Taisho.
In 2002 we recognized an increased amount of revenue under our Novartis collaboration as a result of increased effort allocated to our kinase research program. In the fourth quarter of 2002, our
research and development agreement with Lilly was restructured; the original contractual research term was to conclude in June 2003. In connection with the restructuring of the agreement and
termination of the research term, we recognized approximately $1,637,000 in revenue that had been previously deferred. This deferred revenue related to the development milestone paid in December 2001
and the up-front payment received in June 1997 at the commencement of the collaboration. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2002 we received and recognized a milestone payment of $1,500,000 from
GlaxoSmithKline in connection with the submission of a new drug application for market approval of Lexiva in the U.S.


We
have not entered into any significant collaborative research and development agreements since 2000. Funding under our partnerships with Lilly, Schering and Taisho concluded in 2002.

Research
and development expenses increased to $198,338,000 in 2002 from $141,988,000 in 2001, primarily due to investment in advancing our clinical pipeline and
broadening our research efforts. Our clinical investment was directed primarily toward advancing our second generation p38 MAP kinase inhibitor (VX-702), our IMPDH inhibitors
(VX-148 and merimepodib), our HCV protease inhibitor (VX-950) and ICE inhibitor (VX-765). Development investment increased from $49,071,000 in 2001 to $77,932,000
in 2002. Investment in research increased from $92,917,000 in 2001 to $120,406,000 in 2002, resulting principally from the expansion of our multi-target gene family research programs, including our
kinase program and ion channel program. As a result of our continued expansion, personnel and facilities expenses also increased.

Sales,
general and administrative expenses increased $9,200,000, or 29%, to $41,056,000 in 2002 from $31,856,000 in 2001. The increase is primarily attributable to increased personnel
and professional expenses. Included in the increase in personnel and professional expenses is an increase in expenses relating to the addition of certain key executives, certain process consulting
costs and legal and patent expenses related to continued protection of our intellectual property, including expenses associated with contesting a suit filed by Oregon Health Sciences University.

Merger
related costs of $22,960,000 in 2001 consisted of investment banking, legal and accounting fees associated with the acquisition of Aurora Biosciences Corporation completed on
July 18, 2001.

Interest
income decreased approximately $16,411,000 to $28,722,000 in 2002 from $45,133,000 in 2001. The decrease is a result of both a lower level of invested funds, and lower portfolio
yields due to a reduced interest rate environment.

Interest
expense decreased to approximately $17,684,000 in 2002 from $19,318,000 in 2001. The decrease is a result of the reduction in principal amount of the 2007 Notes. In
October 2001, we repurchased $30,000,0000 in principal amount of our 2007 Notes and recorded a gain of $10,340,000 on the retirement of the notes in the fourth quarter of 2001.

In
April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") 145, "Recission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and
64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." FAS 145 recinds FAS 4 and FAS 64, which addressed the accounting for gains and losses from extinguishment of debt.
Under FAS 145 the gain on retirement of convertible subordinated notes is considered an ordinary item. The gain on retirement of convertible subordinated notes was originally classified in 2001
as an extraordinary item but has been reclassified as part of loss from continuing operations. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, $315,000,000 of the 2007 Notes was outstanding.


Using
the equity method of accounting, we recorded $662,000 as our share of loss in Altus Biologics Inc. (Altus), for the year ended December 31, 2001. The loss is included
in other expense on the Statement of Operations. Effective September 28, 2001, coincident with a financial restructuring of Altus, we changed our method of accounting for Altus from the equity
method to the cost method. See Note I to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In
the third quarter of 2001, in connection with our overall review of accounting policies concurrent with our merger with Aurora, we elected to change our revenue recognition policy for
collaborative and other research and development revenues from the Emerging Issues Task Force No. 91-6 ("EITF 91-6") method to the Substantive Milestone Method, adopted
retroactive to January 1, 2001. We believe this method is preferable because it is reflective of the Company's on-going business operations and is more consistent with industry
practices following the implementation of SAB 101 throughout the biotechnology industry in 2000.

Pursuant
to the 2001 change, we recorded a one-time, non-cash charge of $25,901,000, representing a cumulative change in accounting principle for periods prior to
2001. The amount of revenue recognized in 2003, 2002 and 2001 which was included in the one-time, non-cash charge was $2,809,000, $6,979,000 and $7,748,000, respectively.
Additionally, $3,684,000, $3,628,000 and $1,053,000 will be recognized as revenue in 2004, 2005 and thereafter, respectively, which amounts were included in the January 2001 charge to income.

Effective
July 1, 2001, we adopted Derivative Implementation Group Issue No. A17, "Contracts that Provide for Net Share Settlement" (DIG A17). Pursuant to the adoption of DIG A17,
we recorded a $17,749,000 cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect the value of warrants held in Altus. This amount is included in investments in the December 31, 2001
balance sheet. As of September 30, 2001, the warrants no longer qualified as derivatives under DIG A17 due to changes in the terms of the warrants coincident with a financial restructuring of
Altus.

Forward-looking Statements

This reports contains forward-looking statements about our business, including our expectation that (i) we are positioned to commercialize multiple
products in the coming years that we expect will generate increased revenues; (ii) our losses will continue; (iii) research and development expenses will continue to increase, but
research expenses will not increase without new funding from collaborations; (iv) we will enter into additional strategic collaborations for the development of our drug candidates which are
outside our focus areas of viral and inflammatory diseases; (v) our financial results for 2004 will be as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K; (vi) we will continue to
collaborate with existing and new partners to develop and market Vertex-discovered products for selected major therapeutic areas; (vii) we and our partners will begin clinical trials on a
number of our development stage drug candidates during 2004; (viii) Lexiva will be approved and launched in the E.U. in 2004; (ix) we will initiate expanded clinical trials of merimepodib in
2004, and believe we may be able to file an NDA for merimepodib as early as 2007; (x) development of pralnacasan will be delayed by at least 12-24 months, if the adverse toxicology finding is
satisfactorily addressed; (xi) our Phase II clinical trial of VX-702 will be complete in 2004; (xii) our research programs will produce additional development candidates, including numerous kinase
inhibitors, in the next several years; and (xiii) our liability to restructure the Kendall Square lease will be as we have estimated and we may pay the full amount in the next 24 months. While
management makes its best efforts to be accurate in making forward-looking statements, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially.
These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, our inability to further identify, develop and achieve commercial success for new products and technologies, the possibility of delays in the
research and development necessary to select drug development candidates, the possibility of delays in the commencement or completion of clinical trials, the risk that clinical activities planned for
2004 may not commence as scheduled, the risk that clinical trials may not result in marketable products, the risk that we may be unable to successfully finance and secure regulatory approval of and
market our drug candidates, including Lexiva, our dependence upon existing and new pharmaceutical


and
biotechnology collaborations, the levels and timing of payments under our collaborative agreements, uncertainties about our ability to obtain new corporate collaborations on satisfactory terms, if
at all, the development of competing systems, our ability to protect our proprietary technologies, patent-infringement claims, risks of new, changing and competitive technologies, the risk that there
may be changing and new regulations in the U.S. and internationally and uncertainty about our ability to restructure our obligation under the Kendall Square facility lease. Please see the "Risk
Factors" appearing elsewhere in this report for more details regarding these and other risks. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 ("SFAS 150"),
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies
and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The adoption of SFAS 150 in the third quarter of 2003 did not have a material impact on our
results of operations or financial position.

In
April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 ("SFAS 149"), Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(SFAS 133). The adoption of SFAS 149 in the third quarter of
2003 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

In
November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures the Company must make about obligations under certain guarantees that the company has issued. It also requires the Company to recognize, at
the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are to be applied only
to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. We have provided additional
disclosure with respect to guarantees in Note U to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51" and in
December 2003 issued a revised FIN 46 ("FIN 46R") which addresses the period of adoption of FIN 46 for entities created before January 31, 2003. FIN 46 provides a
new consolidation model which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses. The provisions of FIN 46 are effective for enterpises with variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003. We must adopt the provisions of FIN 46 in the first quarter of 2004 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As part of its investment portfolio, Vertex owns financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks. The investment portfolio is used to preserve Vertex's
capital until it is required to fund operations, including Vertex's research and development activities. None of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes. Vertex does not
have derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio.


Interest Rate Risk

Vertex invests its cash in a variety of financial instruments, principally securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, investment grade corporate
bonds and notes and money market instruments. These investments are denominnated in U.S. dollars. All of its interest-bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk, and could decline in value
if interest rates fluctuate. Substantially all of Vertex's investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity, and Vertex
has implemented guidelines limiting the term to maturity of its investment instruments. Due to the conservative nature of these instruments, Vertex does not believe that it has a material exposure to
interest rate risk.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, after
evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13(a) - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e)) as of the end of the period
covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, have concluded that, based on such evaluation, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective to ensure
that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, was made known to them by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this Annual
Report on Form 10-K was being prepared. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, the Company's management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

(b)

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting.

No change in the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) occurred during the fourth quarter of our last fiscal year, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Auditors

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated:

In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and comprehensive loss and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

As
discussed in Note C to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2001 the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue
recognition. As discussed in Note I to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2001 the Company changed its method of accounting for certain

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

A. The Company

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated ("Vertex" or the "Company") is a biotechnology company in the business of discovering, developing, and commercializing small
molecule drugs for serious diseases including HIV infection, chronic hepatitis C virus infection, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders and cancer, independently and with collaborators. At
December 31, 2003 the Company had three facilities worldwide with more than 720 employees. The Company's facilities are located in Cambridge, MA, San Diego, CA and Abingdon, UK.

The
Company's principal focus is on the development and commercialization of new treatments for viral and inflammatory diseases. There are two Vertex discovered products, Agenerase
(amprenavir) and Lexiva (fosamprenavir calcium), on the market now for the treatment of HIV and AIDs. Agenerase was approved and launched in the United States in April 1999. Lexiva was granted
marketing approval by the FDA in October 2003, and was launched by Vertex and GlaxoSmithKline shortly thereafter. Vertex earns a royalty on the sales of Agenerase and Lexiva and
co-promotes these products in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline. Vertex's pipeline of potential products includes drug candidates targeting chronic hepatitis C infection, drug candidates
targeting inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, acute coronary syndromes and psoriasis, and drug candidates directed at cancer therapy. Additionally, Vertex has built a
drug discovery capability that integrates biology, chemistry, biophysics, automation and information technologies, to make the drug discovery process more efficient and productive.

Partnerships
are a key component of Vertex's corporate strategy. Currently, Vertex has significant collaborations with Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, and Serono. These
collaborations provide Vertex with financial support and other valuable resources for its research programs, development of its clinical drug candidates, and marketing and sales of its products.
Vertex currently has drug candidates in clinical development under collaborations with GlaxoSmithKline, Aventis and Kissei.

The
Company has begun developing certain potential products independently, for markets where Vertex believes it can commercialize products effectively and reach large patient
populations, but expend comparatively fewer resources by using a sales force focused on specialists. At the same time, Vertex is collaborating with partners to discover, develop and market other
Vertex-discovered products for selected major therapeutic areas.

In
July 2001, Vertex completed a merger with Aurora BioSciences Corporation ("Aurora"). Aurora specialized in industry-leading assay development, screening and cell biology
capabilities. The Company acquired all of Aurora's outstanding common stock in a tax-free, stock for stock transaction, for approximately 14.1 million shares of Vertex common stock. Prior to its
acquisition by Vertex, Aurora completed a merger with PanVera Corporation. PanVera Corporation was a biotechnology company engaged in the development, manufacture and worldwide supply of proteins for
evaluation as targets and drug screening assays for high-throughput screening. Both mergers were accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting.

In
July 2002, Vertex began to commercialize the Aurora instruments and services, along with PanVera Corporation's reagents and probes business, under the name PanVera LLC. PanVera
LLC's core business included commercialization of fluorescence assay technologies, assay development services, the manufacture and sale of proteins, reagents and probes, and the development and sale
of instrumentation systems. Upon completion of this reorganization, PanVera LLC comprised the Company's Discovery Tools and Services business and Aurora's remaining business continued to operate at
the former Aurora's San Diego site, as Vertex Pharmaceuticals (San Diego) LLC, dedicated to the Company's pharmaceuticals business.

F-7

In
March and December 2003, in two independent transactions, Vertex sold the assets of the Discovery Tools and Services business. In connection with those sales the buyers paid
approximately $101 million in cash and assumed certain liabilities. As a result of the sales, the Company now operates in one operating segment: Pharmaceuticals. Please refer to Note D
"Sale of Assets" for further information.

Vertex
is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, rapid technological change and competition, dependence on key personnel,
uncertain protection of proprietary technology, clinical trial uncertainty, dependence on collaborative partners, share price volatility, the need to obtain additional funding, uncertainties relating
to pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement, limited experience in manufacturing, sales and marketing, potential product liability and the need to comply with government regulations. The Company
expects to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future, as a result of expenditures for its research and development programs.

B. Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The mergers with Aurora and PanVera have been
accounted for as a pooling of interests under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations" ("APB 16"), and accordingly, the results of operations, financial position and
cash flows for Aurora and PanVera have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company for all periods presented.

The
sale of the assets of the Company's Discovery Tools and Services business in March 2003 and December 2003 represent a component of Vertex's business that, beginning in
2002, had separately identifiable cash flows. As such, pursuant to SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144"), the consolidated
statements of operations and of cash flows have been restated to show the results of operations and cash flows of the assets sold as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The results of
discontinued operations prior to 2002 have been prepared using estimates and assumptions the Company has deemed appropriate based upon the information currently available and does not necessarily
reflect the results that would have been achieved had the business operated on a stand-alone basis for the periods presented. Prior to 2002, the Discovery Tools and Services business was not
separately managed operationally or financially and therefore, Vertex has estimated certain operating expenses based on certain assumptions, including relative costs of the business being sold
compared to historical site costs. Please refer to Note D "Sale of Assets" for further information.

All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

The
Company operates in one segment, Pharmaceuticals, and all revenues are from U.S. operations.

Reclassification in the Preparation of Financial Statements

Certain amounts in prior years' financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the
reported net loss.

F-8

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include costs associated with a
potential lease restructuring, the carrying value of the Company's investments in privately held companies and whether any decline in fair value is considered other than temporary and useful lives for
depreciation and amortization. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that
management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents, which are money market funds and debt securities, are valued at cost plus accrued interest. The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Changes in cash and cash equivalents may be affected by shifts in investment portfolio maturities as
well as by actual cash receipts and disbursements.

Marketable Securities

Marketable securities consist of investments in high-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and U.S. government agency securities that are
classified as available for sale. Since these securities are available to fund current operations, they are classified as current assets on the balance sheet. Marketable securities are stated at fair
value with their unrealized gains and losses included as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a separate component of stockholders' equity, until such gains and losses are realized. The fair value of these securities is based
on quoted market prices. If a decline in the fair value is considered other-than-temporary, based on available evidence, the unrealized loss is transferred from other
comprehensive income (loss) to the consolidated statement of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded $666,000 and $600,000, respectively, in charges to
write down certain marketable securities because the decline in value was considered other-than-temporary. There were no charges to write-down marketable securities in 2003.
Realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method and are included in interest income.

Investments

Investments at December 31, 2003 and 2002 include long term investments recorded under the cost method of accounting. When the Company holds an ownership interest
of less than 20%, and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investment entity's operating activities, the Company accounts for its investment using the cost method. If
any adjustment to the fair value of an investment reflects a decline in the value of that investment below its cost, the Company considers the evidence available to it, including the duration and
extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other-than-temporary. If the decline is considered
other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down is included in the Company's
consolidated

F-9

statement
of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded $1,500,000 in charges related to the write-down of an investment because the decline in the value
of the investment was considered other-than-temporary. There were no charges to write-down investments in 2002 or 2003.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of money market funds and marketable securities.
The Company places these investments in highly rated financial institutions, and, by policy, limits the amounts of credit exposure to any one financial institution. These amounts at times may exceed
federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any credit losses in these accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds. The Company has no
foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other foreign exchange hedging arrangements.

To
date, the Company's revenue has been generated from a limited number of customers in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries in the U.S., Europe and Japan. In 2003 the
Company had significant revenue transactions with Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline, which accounted for 64% and 17%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue. In 2002 and 2001, the Company had
significant revenue transactions with Novartis, which accounted for 26% and 22%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue.

GlaxoSmithKline
and Novartis represented approximately 41% and 29%, respectively, of the Company's accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2003. Kissei Pharmaceuticals and
GlaxoSmithKline represented approximately 27% and 19%, respectively, of the Company's accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2002. Management believes that credit risks associated with
these collaborative partners are not significant.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the lesser of the lease
terms or the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally four to seven years for furniture and equipment and three to five years for computers and software. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the improvements or the remaining life of the lease. Major additions and betterments are capitalized; maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or
extend the life of the respective assets, are charged to operations. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related allowances for depreciation and amortization are
eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.

Assets Held for Sale

The Company classifies long-lived assets as held for sale so long as such assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition, the
Company has the intent and ability to transfer the assets to a buyer within one year and the sale of such assets is considered probable at the balance sheet date. The Company considers a sale probable
when a definitive purchase and sale agreement has been signed. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell. No assets were classified as held for sale
at December 31, 2003 or 2002.

F-10

Long-Lived Assets

The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." In accordance with SFAS No. 144, management assesses the potential impairments of its
long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash
flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset the Company writes down the asset to its estimated fair value.

Retirement of Convertible Subordinated Notes

In October 2001, the Company repurchased and retired $30,000,000 in principal amount of its 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due September 2007 ("2007
Notes"), which resulted in a gain of $10,340,000. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 145, "Recission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 13, and Technical Corrections." SFAS 145 recinds SFAS 4 and SFAS 64, which addressed the accounting for gains and losses from extinguishment of debt. Under SFAS 145 the gain
on retirement of convertible subordinated notes is considered an ordinary item. The gain on retirement of convertible subordinated notes originally was classified as an extraordinary item in 2001, but
has since been reclassified to loss from continuing operations.

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS 148").
SFAS 148 amends SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair-value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has adopted
the quarterly and annual disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 as required.

In
accordance with SFAS 148, the Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123 and applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and related interpretations in accounting for all stock awards granted to employees. Under APB 25, provided other criteria are met, when the
exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans equals the market price of the common stock on the date of grant, no compensation cost is required. When the exercise price of options
granted to employees under these plans is less than the market price of the common stock on the date of grant, compensation costs are expensed over the vesting period. Subsequent changes to option
terms can also give rise to compensation costs.

At
December 31, 2003 the Company had three stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note O "Common and Preferred Stock." For the year
ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded $16,000 in compensation expense related to restricted shares issued to employees in 2003. No stock-based employee compensation cost related to
stock options is reflected in the net loss, as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. For stock
options granted to nonemployees, the Company recognizes compensation costs in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 123. SFAS 123

F-11

requires
that companies recognize compensation expense for grants of stock, stock options and other equity instruments based on fair value.

The
following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per share if the fair value recognition of SFAS 123 had been applied to the Company's stock-based employee
compensation.

Restructuring and Other Expense

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146 "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"). SFAS 146
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF 94-3 "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits
and other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." The principal differences between SFAS 146 and EITF 94-3 relate to the timing of
recording a liability and the value of the liability recorded; SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is
incurred and that the liability be recorded at fair value. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.

The
Company adopted SFAS 146 as required and accordingly records costs and liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities, as defined in SFAS 146, at fair value
in the period the liability is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, changes to the liability are measured using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate applied in the initial
period. In 2003, the Company recorded costs and liabilities for exit and disposal activities related to a restructuring plan, including a decision not to occupy a leased facility, in accordance with
SFAS 146. The liability is evaluated and adjusted as appropriate on at least a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances. Please refer to Note E "Restructuring and Other Expense" for
further information.

Revenue Recognition

The Company's revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
"Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"), as amended by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition." In third quarter of 2003, the Company adopted Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables" ("EITF 00-21"). EITF 00-21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting for
arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF 00-21 apply to revenue

F-12

arrangements
entered into after June 30, 2003. The Company generates revenues through collaborative research and development agreements and royalties on commercialized products.

Collaborative and Other Research and Development Revenue

The Company's collaborative and other research and development revenue is generated primarily through collaborative research and development agreements with
strategic partners for the discovery, development and commercialization of major pharmaceutical products. The terms of the agreements typically include non-refundable up-front
license fees, funding of research and development efforts, payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales.

In
the third quarter of 2001, in connection with an overall review of accounting policies concurrent with the merger with Aurora, Vertex elected to change its revenue recognition policy
for collaborative and other research and development revenues from the Emerging Issues Task Force No. 91-6 ("EITF 91-6") Method to the Substantive Milestone Method,
adopted retroactively to January 1, 2001. Under the Substantive Milestone Method, the Company recognizes revenue from non-refundable, up-front license fees and
milestones, not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, ratably over the contracted or estimated period of performance. Research funding is recognized as earned, ratably over the period of
effort. Milestones, based on designated achievement points that are considered at risk and substantive at the inception of the collaborative agreement, are recognized as earned, when the earnings
process is complete and the corresponding payment is reasonably assured. The Company evaluates whether milestones are at risk and substantive based on the contingent nature of the milestone,
specifically reviewing factors such as the technological and commercial risk that needs to be overcome and the level of investment required. Because Vertex's adoption of the Substantive Milestone
Method in the third quarter of 2001 was retroactive to January 1, 2001, the results of the first two quarters of 2001 have been restated in accordance with the new revenue policy. Pursuant to
the 2001 change, Vertex recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $25,901,000, representing a cumulative change in accounting principle for periods prior to 2001.

Under
EITF 00-21, in multiple element arrangements, license payments are recognized together with any up-front payment and the research and development funding as a single
unit of accounting, unless the delivered technology has stand alone value to the customer and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements in the arrangement. The
Company did not receive any license payments during 2003. License payments received during the course of a collaboration that do not meet the separation criteria above are recognized, when earned, in
proportion to the period of time completed on the contract relative to the total contracted or estimated period of performance on the underlying research and development collaboration, with the
remaining amount deferred and recognized ratably over the remaining period of performance. Payments received after performance obligations are complete are recognized when earned.

Royalty Revenue

Royalty revenue is recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by the collaborative partner and
is recognized in the period the sales occur. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues, which have not been historically significant, are reconciled and adjusted for
in the quarter they become known.

F-13

Research and Development

All research and development costs, including amounts funded in research collaborations, are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses are comprised
of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead costs, clinical trial costs, contract services and other outside costs.

Advertising

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, advertising expenses totaled $431,000 and $444,000,
respectively. There were no advertising costs in 2003.

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the income tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is applied against any net deferred tax asset if, based on the weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not
that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs related to expenses incurred to complete Vertex's convertible subordinated note offerings are deferred and included in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheet. The costs are amortized based on the effective interest method over the term of the related debt issuance. The amortization expense is included in interest expense on the
consolidated statements of operations.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), which includes foreign currency translation adjustments and
unrealized gains and losses on certain marketable securities. For purposes of comprehensive income (loss) disclosures, the Company does not record tax provisions or benefits for the net changes in
foreign currency translation adjustment, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiary is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary are remeasured into U.S.
dollars at rates of exchange in effect at the end of the year. Revenue and expense amounts are remeasured using the average exchange rates for the period. Net unrealized gains and losses resulting
from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other comprehensive income (loss), which is a separate component of stockholders' equity.

Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share

Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus additional weighted average common equivalent shares outstanding during the period when the effect is not
anti-dilutive. Common equivalent shares result from the exercise of outstanding stock options, the proceeds of which are then assumed to have

F-14

been
used to repurchase outstanding stock using the treasury stock method, the assumed conversion of convertible notes and unvested restricted shares of common stock. Common equivalent shares have not
been included in the net loss per share calculations as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Total potential gross common equivalent shares, before applying the treasury stock method, at
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 consisted of 16,802,000, 17,065,000 and 16,810,000 stock options outstanding, respectively, with a weighted average exercise price of $23.42, $25.73 and $27.37,
respectively. At December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 there were notes convertible into 3,414,264 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $92.26 per share. At December 31, 2003 there
were 124,481 unvested restricted shares of common stock. Please refer to Note M "Convertible Subordinated Notes" for further information about Vertex's recent exchange of convertible notes.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"). SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The adoption of SFAS 150 in the third quarter of 2003 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operation or
financial position.

In
April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"
("SFAS 149"). SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

. The adoption of SFAS 149 in the third quarter of 2003 did not have
a material impact on the Company's results of operation or financial position.

In
November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures the Company must make about obligations under certain guarantees that the company has issued. It also requires the Company to recognize, at
the inception of
a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are to be applied only to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. The Company has provided
additional disclosure with respect to guarantees in Note U "Guarantees."

In
January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51" and in
December 2003 issued a revised FIN 46 ("FIN 46R") which addresses the period of adoption of FIN 46 for entities created before January 31, 2003. FIN 46 provides a
new consolidation model which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses. The provisions of FIN 46 are effective for enterprises with variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The Company must adopt the provisions of FIN 46 in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and does not expect the adoption to have a material
impact on the consolidated financial statements.

C. Change in Accounting Principle—Revenue Recognition

In the third quarter of 2001, in connection with an overall review of accounting policies concurrent with the merger with Aurora, Vertex elected to change its
revenue recognition policy for collaborative and other research and development revenues from the EITF 91-6 Method to the Substantive Milestone Method adopted retroactively to
January 1, 2001. Vertex believes this method is preferable because it is more reflective of the Company's on-going business operations and is more consistent with industry practices
following the implementation of SAB 101 throughout the biotechnology industry in 2000. Under the Substantive Milestone Method, the Company recognizes revenue from non-refundable
up-front license fees and milestones, not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, ratably over the contracted or estimated period of performance. Research funding is recognized
as earned, ratably over the period of effort. Milestones, based on designated achievement points that are considered at risk and substantive at inception of the contract, are recognized as earned, and
a separate earnings process is complete, when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured. The Company evaluates whether milestones are at risk and substantive based on the contingent nature of
the milestone, specifically reviewing factors such as the technological and commercial risk that needs to be overcome and the level of investment required.

Pursuant
to the 2001 change in accounting principle to the Substantive Milestone Method, Vertex recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $25,901,000, representing a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for periods prior to 2001. The impact of the adoption of this new accounting policy for revenue recognition for collaborative and other research
and development revenues was to defer revenue recognition for certain portions of revenue previously recognized under Vertex's collaborative agreements into future accounting periods. Since Vertex's
adoption of the Substantive Milestone Method in the third quarter of 2001 was retroactive to January 1, 2001, the results of the first two quarters of 2001 have been restated in accordance with
this revenue recognition policy. Included in collaborative and other research and development revenue is $2,809,000 and $6,979,000 of revenue recognized in 2003 and 2002, respectively, that was
included in the one-time non-cash charge of $25,901,000. The amount of revenue to be recognized in future years that was included in the one-time
non-cash charge of $25,901,000 is $3,684,000, $3,628,000 and $1,053,000 in 2004, 2005 and thereafter, respectively.

D. Sale of Assets

In March and December 2003, in two independent transactions, Vertex sold the assets of its Discovery Tools and Services business. The Discovery Tools and
Services business specialized in assay development, screening services, instrumentation development and sales and the manufacture and sale of proteins, reagents and probes. As a result of these sales,
the Company now operates in one operating segment: Pharmaceuticals.

On
March 28, 2003, Vertex completed the sale of certain assets of the Discovery Tools and Services business, including certain proprietary reagents, probes and proteins and
certain biochemical and cellular assay capabilities, to Invitrogen Corporation ("PanVera Asset Sale"). Substantially all of the assets sold were owned by Vertex's wholly-owned subsidiary, PanVera. In
connection with the sale, Mirus Corporation ("Mirus") exercised a right of first refusal with respect to shares of Mirus owned by PanVera. Additionally, on the same date, Mirus acquired certain of
PanVera's assets. The aggregate gross consideration received by PanVera for the assets conveyed to Invitrogen and Mirus was approximately $97 million in cash and assumption of certain
liabilities.

In
connection with the sale, Vertex obtained a license from Invitrogen to make and use the reagents and probes sold to Invitrogen solely for its drug discovery activities, independently
and with

F-16

partners,
but has agreed that it will not engage in the business of providing reagents, probes or assay development services to third parties for a term of five years. Vertex also agreed to purchase a
minimum of $3 million of specified products annually from Invitrogen for three years after the completion of the sale. The prices of the products within the purchase commitment approximate fair
value. The sale did not include the instrumentation assets of the Discovery Tools and Services business, which were historically managed both financially and operationally together with the assets
sold on March 28, 2003.

The
Company recorded a gain on the PanVera Asset Sale of approximately $69 million. The gain was recorded net of transaction costs and certain accruals and receivables established
for transaction bonuses payable by Vertex to former employees meeting certain employment requirements, an obligation in connection with certain annual contractual license fees under a customer
agreement, estimated losses on the three year purchase commitment for required payments in excess of the fair value of products expected to be purchased and an adjustment based upon the net book value
of the assets sold on the closing date. Vertex has not recorded any income tax liability associated with the gain on the sale. It is anticipated that operating losses will be used to offset the
taxable income generated from the sale. Accruals recorded in connection with the sale are included in other obligations, current and non-current, on the condensed consolidated balance
sheets.

On
December 3, 2003, Vertex sold the remaining instrumentation assets of its Discovery Tools and Services business to Aurora Discovery, Inc., a new company formed by
Telegraph Hill Partners, LP and certain former employees of Vertex, for approximately $4.3 million and the assumption of certain liabilities. The assets sold were used to develop and
commercialize liquid and cell-dispensing instruments that are used in high throughput drug discovery screening and large-scale, automated molecular biology. Vertex has retained
non-exclusive licenses to use the instrumentation technologies sold in its drug discovery research. The Company recorded a $1.0 million gain on the sale. The gain was recorded net
of transaction costs. The Company did not record any income tax liability associated with the sale in December 2003. It is anticipated that operating losses will be used to offset the taxable
income generated from the sale.

The
combination of the Discovery Tools and Services assets sold in March 2003 and in December 2003 represents a component of the Company's business that, beginning in 2002,
was managed separately both financially and operationally.

In
accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144"), the results of operations and cash flows of the assets
sold have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements under the heading "discontinued operations" for all periods presented. The reclassification of the amounts to discontinued
operations have been prepared using certain estimates and assumptions deemed appropriate based upon information available. Amounts reclassified to discontinued operations are not necessarily
indicative of what revenues, expenses or income would have been had the business operated on a stand-alone basis. Prior to 2002, the Discovery Tools and Services business was not separately managed
operationally or financially and therefore, certain operating expenses were estimated based on certain assumptions, including relative costs of the business sold compared to historical site costs.

E. Restructuring and Other Expense

On June 10, 2003, Vertex adopted a plan to restructure its operations in preparation for investments in advancing major products through clinical
development to commercialization. The restructuring was designed to rebalance the Company's relative investment in research, development and commercialization, to better enable the Company to pursue
its long-term objective of becoming a profitable pharmaceutical company with industry-leading capabilities in research, development and commercialization of products. The restructuring
plan included a workforce reduction, write-offs of certain assets and a decision not to occupy the Kendall Square facility. The facility is approximately 290,000 square feet of specialized
laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts ("Kendall Square Lease"). The lease commenced in January 2003 and has a 15-year term. The Company is actively trying to
restructure the lease obligation. The Company recorded restructuring and other related expenses of $91.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The $91.8 million
includes $78.7 million of potential lease restructuring expense, $6.0 million of lease operating expense incurred prior to the decision not to occupy the Kendall Square facility,
$2.6 million for severance and related employee transition benefits and $4.5 million for a write-off of leasehold improvements and other assets.

As
a result of the Company's restructuring plan and in accordance with SFAS 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," the Company recorded an
initial estimate, at fair value, in the second quarter of 2003. The Company reviews its assumptions and estimates quarterly and updates the liability as changes in circumstances require. Of the $78.7
million of the potential lease restructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2003, $34.9 million, $42.4 million and $1.4 million was recorded in the second, third
and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively. As prescribed

F-18

by
SFAS 146, the liability recorded with respect to the potential lease restructuring was calculated using probability weighted discounted cash flows based on the Company's assumptions and
estimates regarding the possible outcomes of the potential lease restructuring, including contractual rental and build-out commitments, lease buy-out, time to sublease the
space and sublease rental rates. The Company validates its estimates and assumptions through consultations with independent third parties having relevant expertise. The Company used a credit-adjusted
risk-free rate of approximately 10% to discount the estimated cash flows. The incremental $42.4 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2003 resulted from revised
expectations of the Company's potential liability due to an increase in available laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts and certain other factors which led to a corresponding overall
decline in real estate market fundamentals. Accordingly, the Company revised its expectations of attainable sublease terms, assuming lower sublease rental rates and a delay in occupancy by a
subtenant.

The
expense and liability related to the potential lease restructuring requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. The Company will review the estimates and
assumptions on at least a quarterly basis, until the outcome is finalized, and make whatever modifications management believes to be necessary, based on the Company's best judgment, to reflect any
changed circumstances. It is possible that such estimates could change in the future resulting in additional adjustments, and the effect of any such adjustments could be material. Because the
Company's estimate of the liability related to the potential lease restructuring includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time value of money, the estimate of the liability will
change as a result of time passing. Any such changes to the Company's estimate of the liability are recorded as additional restructuring and other expense.

The
severance, benefits and other related costs also were recorded in accordance with SFAS 146. The Company specifically identified all employees whose employment was to be
terminated and notified them prior to the end of the quarter in which the related charge was recorded. This restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of 111 employees, or 13% of the Company's
workforce, of which 66 were from the Cambridge site and 45 were from the San Diego site. Of the terminated employees, 59% were from research, 30% were from sales, general and administrative, who
primarily supported research, and 11% were from development.

The
payment of the remaining accrued liability of approximately $69.5 million related to the potential lease restructuring and other expense is dependent upon the ultimate terms
of any restructuring of the lease.

The
sale of certain assets of the Discovery Tools and Services business in March 2003 included the laboratory, production and office facility owned by the Company in Madison,
Wisconsin. This asset appears in the table above with a book value of $6,133,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002.

In
2003 and 2002, the Company wrote off certain assets that were fully depreciated and no longer utilized. There was no effect on the Company's net property and equipment. Additionally,
the Company wrote off certain assets that were not fully depreciated. The total expense for those assets was $148,000.

I. Investments

In February 1999, Vertex restructured its investment in Altus Biologics Inc. ("Altus"), which was a majority owned subsidiary, so that Altus would
operate independently from Vertex. As part of the transaction, Vertex provided Altus $3,000,000 of cash and surrendered its shares of Altus preferred stock in exchange for two new classes of preferred
stock and warrants. Vertex accounted for its investment in Altus under the equity method of accounting.

F-21

In
September and November of 2001, Altus underwent financial restructurings, which reduced Vertex's relative ownership in Altus to approximately 14% and 11% on the respective dates.
Accordingly, effective September 28, 2001, Vertex began accounting for its investment in Altus using the cost method. For the period from January 1, 2001 through September 28,
2001, Vertex recorded $662,000 as its share of Altus' losses under the equity method of accounting. The loss is included in other expense on the statement of operations.

In
the third quarter of 2001, Vertex adopted Derivative Implementation Group Issue No. A17, "Contracts that Provide for Net Share Settlement" ("DIG A17"). Subsequent to the issuance of
SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities," the FASB established the Derivatives Implementation Group to address and interpret practice issues
relating to that standard. On April 10, 2001, the FASB published DIG A17 relating to contracts that provide for net share settlement, including warrants of a privately held company. Pursuant to
the adoption of DIG A17 on July 1, 2001, Vertex recorded a $17,749,000 cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect the value of warrants held in Altus as income with a
corresponding increase to Investments. The valuation of the warrants was determined based on an independent appraisal that used the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Significant assumptions used in
the Black-Scholes model included the fair value of Altus' common stock, which was based on a valuation of Altus using projected discounted cash flows and comparable market values using multiples of
revenue, volatility of 70%, risk-free interest rates between 4.9% to 5.6% and warrant terms per the agreements ranging from 3.5 to 11.6 years. As of September 30, 2001, the warrants no
longer qualified as derivatives under DIG A17 due to changes in the terms of the warrants coincident with the financial restructuring of Altus. The Company's cost basis carrying value in its
outstanding equity and warrants of Altus was $18,813,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2003 the Company did not have any additional investments in
privately held companies. The Company held investments in other privately held companies at December 31, 2002, which investments were disposed of in the sale of certain assets of the Discovery
Tools and Services business in March 2003.

In
accordance with the Company's policy, as outlined in Note B, the Company has assessed its investment in Altus and determined that there had not been any adjustments to the
respective fair values indicating a decrease in the fair value of the investment below the carrying value that would require the Company to write-down the investment basis of the
investment at December 31, 2003.

At December 31, 2003, the Company had obligations under capital leases for the short-term only; there are no obligations under long-term
capital leases. At December 31, 2003 the Company had capital lease obligations due of $113,000, of which $2,000 represents interest payments.

L. Commitments

The Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The Company's leases have terms through the year 2018.
The term of the Kendall Square Lease began January 1, 2003 and lease payments commenced in May 2003. The Company has an obligation, staged over a number of years, to build out the space
into finished laboratory and office space. The lease will expire in 2018 with options to extend the lease for two consecutive terms of ten years each, ultimately expiring in 2038. In June 2003,
the Company decided not to occupy the space under this lease and is actively seeking to restructure the lease and to secure subtenancies acceptable to the landlord. See Note E for further
information.

The
Company has future contractual commitments in connection with its research and development programs. For 2004 and 2005 the amounts committed under these contracts are $2,769,000 and
$2,365,000, respectively.

In
connection with the PanVera Asset Sale (see Note D), Vertex agreed to purchase a minimum of $3 million of certain specified products from Invitrogen annually for three
years. The estimated losses on the three year purchase commitment for anticipated payments in excess of the fair value of products expected to be purchased have been booked against the gain on the
sale and recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets.

M. Convertible Subordinated Notes

On September 19, 2000, the Company issued $345,000,000 of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due September 2007 ("2007 Notes"). In
October 2001, the Company repurchased $30,000,000 in principal amount of the 2007 Notes for cash consideration of $18,900,000. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a
gain on the early extinguishment of debt of $10,340,000, net of $760,000 of deferred debt costs, in the fourth quarter of 2001. At December 31, 2003, the 2007 Notes

F-23

had
an outstanding balance of $315,000,000 and a fair value of $282,860,000 as obtained from a quoted market source.

The
2007 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a price equal to $92.26 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2007 Notes
bear interest at
the rate of 5% per annum, and the Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the notes on March 19 and September 19 of
each year. The 2007 Notes are redeemable by the Company at any time on or after September 19, 2003 at specific redemption prices if the closing price of the Company's common stock exceeds 120%
of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days. The deferred financing costs associated with the sale of the convertible notes,
which are classified as long-term other assets, were $9,297,000 of which $1,401,000, $1,401,000 and $1,498,000 and were amortized to interest expense in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

On
February 13, 2004, Vertex exchanged approximately $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Notes for approximately $153.1 million in
aggregate principal amount of newly issued 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 ("2011 Notes"). The 2011 Notes were issued through a private offering to qualified
institutional buyers. The 2011 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a price equal to $14.94 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2011
Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.75% per annum, and the Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance on February 15 and
August 15 of each year. On or after February 15, 2007, the Company may redeem the notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The
2011 Notes are senior in right of payment to the 2007 Notes. Upon completion of the exchange, the Company had approximately $161.9 million in aggregate principal amount of 2007 Notes and
approximately $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 2011 Notes.

N. Income Taxes

For the year ended December 31, 2003, there is no provision for income taxes included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the years ended
December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, the Company provided approximately $276,000 and $630,000, respectively, for income taxes which was recorded in other expense on the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. The provision principally relates to certain foreign obligations. The Company's federal statutory income tax rate for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was 34%. The Company has incurred
losses from operations but has not recorded an income tax benefit for 2003, 2002 and 2001 as the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against its net operating losses and other net deferred tax
assets due to uncertainties related to the realizability of these tax assets.

Deferred
tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the

Of
the $320,206,000 gross deferred tax asset at December 31, 2003, $102,919,000 relates to deductions for nonqualified stock options, which will be credited to additional
paid-in capital, if realized.

For
federal income tax purposes, as of December 31, 2003, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $542,726,000 and tax credits of $15,686,000 which may
be used to offset future income. The operating loss carryforwards will expire as follows: $1,329,000 in 2005, $4,462,000 in 2006 and $536,935,000 thereafter. The tax credit carryforwards begin to
expire in 2004. A valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of the 2003 deferred tax asset since it is more likely
than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $1,400,000, which have no expiration date.

Ownership
changes, as defined by Internal Revenue Code, may have limited the amount of net operating losses and research and experimentation credit carryforwards that can be utilized
annually to offset future taxable income and taxes payable.

O. Common and Preferred Stock

Common Stock

Stock and Option Plans

The Company has a 1991 Stock Option Plan (the "1991 Plan"), a 1994 Stock and Option Plan (the "1994 Plan") and a 1996 Stock and Option Plan (the "1996 Plan").
Stock options may be granted under the Plans either as options intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" ("ISOs") under the Internal Revenue Code or as non-qualified stock options
("NQSOs"). Under the 1991 Plan, stock options may be granted to employees (including officers and directors who are employees) and to consultants of the Company (NQSOs only). Under the 1994 Plan and
the 1996 Plan, stock rights, which may be (i) ISOs when Internal Revenue Code requirements are met, (ii) NQSOs, or (iii) shares of common stock or the opportunity to make a direct
purchase of shares of common stock ("Stock

F-25

Awards"),
may be granted to employees (including officers and directors who are employees) and consultants, advisors and non-employee directors (NQSOs and stock awards only). Under the
1991 and 1994 Plans, ISOs may be granted at a price not less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant, and NQSOs may be granted at an exercise price established by the
Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which may be less than, equal to or greater than the fair value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Stock options
granted under the 1996 Plan may not be granted at a price less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Vesting is ratable over specified periods for all plans, is
generally four or five years, and is determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee. ISOs granted under the Plans must expire not more than ten years from the date of grant.

In
July 2001, in connection with the acquisition of Aurora, the Company assumed the obligations under the Aurora 1996 Stock Plan (the "Aurora Stock Plan"), the 1993 Stock Plan of
PanVera Corporation (the "PanVera Plan") and certain non-plan stock option agreements ("Non-Plan Stock Option Agreements") under which 1,039,596, 3,328 and 2,697 shares of
Vertex's common stock, respectively, were reserved for issuance at December 31, 2003.

The
Company has reserved 8,000,000 shares under the 1991 Plan and 1994 Plan. The Company reserved 22,000,000 shares for issuance under the 1996 Plan, of which 5,500,000
were reserved during 2001 and 6,000,000 were reserved in 2002. At December 31, 2003, the Company had a total of 5,026,815 shares of common stock available for future grant under its 1991, 1994
and 1996 stock option plans. No shares remain available for grant under the Aurora Stock Plan, the PanVera Plan or Non-Plan Stock Option Agreements.

In
December 2003, the Company issued 124,481 shares of restricted Common Stock to employees and all of the shares were outstanding and unvested at December 31, 2003. The
restricted shares vest over four years in four equal annual installments. The fair value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant was $9.07 and the price per share was $0.01 per
share, which is the par value of the Company's Common Stock. The Company recorded deferred compensation of approximately $1,128,000 related to the issuance of the restricted shares.

Stock Based Compensation

The Company records and amortizes over the related vesting periods deferred compensation representing the difference between the exercise price of stock options
granted or the price per share of restricted stock issued, and the fair value of the Company's Common Stock at the date of grant or issuance. Amortization of deferred compensation expense of $16,000,
$20,000, and $154,000 was recognized during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Compensation
cost, calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, recognized in connection with the issuance of stock options to nonemployees was $161,826, $292,000 and $320,000
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

On July 1, 1992, Vertex adopted the Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Vertex Purchase Plan"). On May 17, 2002,
at the Company's annual meeting, the shareholders approved certain amendments to the Vertex Purchase Plan. One of the amendments reserved an additional 600,000 shares for issuance under the Vertex
Purchase Plan. The Vertex Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to enroll in a twelve month offering period comprising two
six month purchase periods to purchase shares of the Company's common stock, through payroll deductions, at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the
applicable twelve month offering period or the last day of the applicable six month purchase period, whichever is lower. In September 2002, the Vertex Purchase Plan was further amended by the
Company's Board of Directors to make certain changes to the administration of the Vertex Purchase Plan.

In
connection with the acquisition of Aurora in July 2001, the Company assumed the obligations under the Aurora Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Aurora Purchase Plan"). The
Aurora Purchase Plan provided for all eligible employees to purchase the Company's common stock, through payroll withholdings, at a price of 85% of the lesser of fair market value on the start date of
each overlapping two-year offering period or on the date on which each semi-annual purchase period ends. The Aurora Purchase Plan was terminated in the second quarter of 2002
following a semi-annual purchase.

Rights

Each holder of a share of outstanding Common Stock also holds one share purchase right (a "Right") for each share of Common Stock. Each Right entitles the holder
to purchase from the Company one half of one-hundredth of a share of Series A junior participating preferred stock, $0.01 par value (the "Junior Preferred Shares"), of the Company
at a price of $135 per one half of one-hundredth of a Junior Preferred Share (the "Purchase Price"). The Rights are not exercisable until the earlier of acquisition by a person or group of
15% or more of the outstanding Common Stock (an "Acquiring Person") or the announcement of an intention to make or commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer, the consummation of which would
result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Stock. In the event that any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right other
than the Acquiring Person will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that number of shares of Common Stock having a market value

F-28

of
two times the Purchase Price and, in the event that the Company is acquired in a business combination transaction or 50% or more of its assets are sold, each holder of a Right will thereafter have
the right to receive upon exercise that number of shares of Common Stock of the acquiring company which at the time of the transaction will have a market value of two times the Purchase Price. Under
certain specified circumstances, the Board of Directors of the Company may cause the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group) to be exchanged, in whole or in part, for Common Stock or
Junior Preferred Shares, at an exchange rate of one share of Common Stock per Right or one half of one-hundredth of a Junior Preferred Share per Right. At any time prior to the acquisition
by a person or group of beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole at a price of $0.01 per Right.

P. Significant Revenue Arrangements

The Company has formed strategic collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies in the areas of drug discovery, development, and commercialization. Research
and development agreements provide the Company with financial support and other valuable resources for research programs and development of clinical drug candidates, product development and marketing
and sales of products.

Collaborative Research and Development Agreements

In the Company's collaborative research, development and commercialization programs the Company seeks to discover, develop and commercialize major pharmaceutical
products in conjunction with and supported by the Company's collaborators. Collaborative research and development arrangements provide research funding over an initial contract period with renewal and
termination options that vary by agreement. The agreements also include milestone payments based on the achievement or the occurrence of a designated event. The agreements may also contain development
reimbursement provisions, royalty rights or profit sharing rights and manufacturing options. The terms of each agreement vary. The Company has entered into significant research and development
collaborations with large pharmaceutical companies.

F-29

P. Significant Revenue Arrangements

Novartis

In May 2000, the Company and Novartis Pharma AG ("Novartis") entered into an agreement to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization
of small molecule drugs directed at targets in the kinase protein family. Under the agreement, Novartis agreed to pay the Company an up-front payment of $15,000,000 made upon signing of
the agreement, up to $200,000,000 in product research funding over six years and further license fees, milestone payments and cost reimbursements based in part on the progress of drug candidates
through development. The Company was responsible for drug discovery and clinical proof-of-concept testing of all drug candidates. Under the agreement, Novartis created a
$200,000,000 loan facility to support the Company's early clinical development activities under the agreement. The agreement provided that the loans would be interest free and Novartis would forgive
the full amount of any advances with respect to a particular drug candidate accepted by Novartis for development under the agreement. At December 31, 2003 and 2002 $32,455,000 and $5,000,000,
respectively, were outstanding under this loan facility. Novartis has exclusive worldwide development, manufacturing and marketing rights to clinically and commercially relevant drug candidates that
it accepts from the Company for development. Vertex will receive royalties on any products that are marketed as part of the collaboration. Novartis had the right to terminate this agreement without
cause upon one year's written notice effective no earlier than May 2004. In 2003, 2002 and 2001 the Company recognized approximately $44,502,000, $41,894,000 and $36,723,000, respectively, in
revenue under this agreement.

In
February 2004 the Company amended the Novartis collaboration. Vertex will continue to be responsible for drug discovery under the amended agreement, and Novartis will continue to
provide research funding through the end of the research term in April 2006. However, under the agreement as modified, Novartis will be responsible for all clinical and nonclinical development of drug
candidates which it accepts for development, and consequently the loan facility has been eliminated. The Company may either continue development of its drug candidate VX-680 under the terms of the
original agreement, using loan proceeds from the Novartis loan facility, or elect to develop and commercialize
VX-680 independent of Novartis. Upon selection of a pre-clinical drug candidate under the restructured agreement, Novartis will pay Vertex a $10 million selection milestone, and
Vertex may receive up to $25 million per drug candidate in pre-commercial milestones. Vertex will continue to receive royalties on sales of products that are commercialized as part
of the collaboration. Outstanding loans which funded amounts either spent or committed to be spent on development activities relating to a particular compound will be forgiven if that compound is
selected by Novartis for development. If not, the related loan will be repayable without interest in May 2008. If the Company elects to develop and commercialize VX-680 independent of Novartis, loan
amounts with respect to that drug candidate which are unspent and uncommitted at the time of the Company's election will be repayable immediately. At December 31, 2003, approximately $14 million in
development loans previously advanced to Vertex on account of VX-680 were unspent and uncommitted. Novartis no longer has the right to terminate this agreement without cause.

GlaxoSmithKline

In December 1993, the Company and GlaxoSmithKline ("GSK") entered into a collaborative agreement to research, develop and commercialize HIV protease
inhibitors, including Agenerase (amprenavir), Lexiva (fosamprenavir calcium) and VX-385. Under the collaborative agreement, GSK agreed to pay the Company up to $42,000,000 comprised of an
up-front $15,000,000 license payment made in 1993, $14,000,000 of product research funding over five years and $13,000,000 of development and commercialization milestone payments for an
initial drug candidate. Research funding under this

F-30

agreement
ended on December 31, 1998 and Vertex has received the entire $42 million referenced above. Vertex is also entitled to royalties on sales of its protease inhibitors by GSK. The
Company began earning a royalty from GSK in 1999 on sales of Agenerase, and in the fourth quarter of 2003 on sales of Lexiva. GSK is also obligated to pay additional development and commercialization
milestone payments for subsequent drug candidates, including Lexiva and VX-385. In the fourth quarter of 2003, GSK paid the Company a milestone payment of $2,500,000 for the FDA approval
of Lexiva in the United States. In the fourth quarter of 2002, GSK paid the Company a milestone payment of $1,500,000 for the submission of a new drug application for market approval of Lexiva in the
United States and the European Union. GSK is required to bear the costs of development in its territory of drug candidates under the collaboration. Under the original agreement, GSK had exclusive
rights to develop and commercialize Vertex's HIV protease inhibitors in all parts of the world except the Far East. In 2003, the Company amended the agreement to add the Far East to GSK's territory
for development and commercialization of Lexiva. The Company has retained certain bulk drug manufacturing rights and certain co-promotion rights in territories licensed to GSK. GSK has the
right to terminate its arrangement with the Company without cause upon twelve months' notice. Termination of the agreement by GSK will relieve it of its obligation to make further commercialization
and development milestone and royalty payments and will end any license granted to GSK by Vertex under the agreement. Revenues and royalties earned from GSK were $11,502,000, $11,554,000, and
$10,783,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In
June 1996, the Company and GSK obtained a worldwide, non-exclusive license under certain G.D. Searle & Co. ("Searle") patents in the area of HIV protease
inhibition. The Company pays Searle a royalty based on sales of Agenerase and Lexiva.

Aventis S.A.

In September 1999, the Company and Aventis S.A. ("Aventis"), formerly Hoechst Marion Roussel Deutschland GmbH, entered into an expanded agreement covering
the development of pralnacasan, an orally active inhibitor of interleukin-1

b

converting enzyme. Under the agreement, Aventis agreed to make
a $20,000,000 up-front payment to the Company for prior research costs, and up to $62,000,000 in milestone payments for successful development by Aventis of pralnacasan in the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis, the first targeted indication. Milestone payments are also due for each additional indication. The research collaboration under this agreement ended in 1997. Aventis has an
exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and market pralnacasan. Aventis will fund the development of pralnacasan. Vertex may co-promote pralnacasan in the U.S. and Europe.
Vertex will receive royalties on global sales, if any. The agreement also provides that Aventis will partially fund a Vertex co-promotion effort in the United States under certain conditions. Aventis
may terminate this agreement without cause upon six months' written notice. Termination by Aventis will end any license granted to Aventis by Vertex under the agreement. The Company did not earn any
revenue in connection with the Aventis collaboration in 2003, 2002 or 2001.

Serono S.A.

In December 2000, the Company and Serono S.A. ("Serono") entered into an agreement to collaborate on the discovery, development, and commercialization of
certain types of caspase inhibitors. Under the agreement, the Company could receive up to $95,000,000 in pre-commercial payments, comprised of $5,000,000 in up-front payments
for prior research, up to $20,000,000 in product research funding over five years and up to $70,000,000 in further license fees and milestone payments. These amounts are based on the development of
more than one drug candidate. The two companies will

F-31

share
development costs. Vertex has the option to establish a joint venture with Serono for the commercialization of products in North America, where the two companies will share marketing rights and
profits from the sale of drug products, if any. Serono will have exclusive rights to market caspase inhibitors in other territories, excluding Japan and certain other countries in the Far East, and
will pay Vertex for the supply of drug substance. Serono has the right to terminate the agreement without cause effective at the end of 2004, upon written notice delivered on or before the end of
June 2004.

In
2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized approximately $5,280,000, $5,280,000 and $4,802,000 as revenue, respectively, from Serono.

The
Company in 2003, 2002 and 2001 recognized an aggregate of $267,000, $25,815,000 and $24,674,000, respectively, in revenue from collaborations with Kissei Pharmaceuticals
Co. Ltd., Eli Lilly & Company, Taisho Pharmaceuticals Co., LTD and Schering AG.

Q. Employee Benefits

The Company has a 401(k) retirement plan (the "Vertex 401(k) Plan") in which substantially all of its permanent employees are eligible to participate.
Participants may contribute up to 60% of their annual compensation to the plan, subject to statutory limitations. The Company may declare discretionary matching contributions to the Vertex 401(k) Plan
which are payable in the form of Company shares. The match is paid in fully vested Company shares and employees have the ability to transfer funds from Company stock as they choose. The Company
declared matching contributions to the Vertex 401(k) Plan as follows (in thousands, except share data):

In
connection with the acquisition of Aurora in July 2001, the Company assumed the Aurora 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan and 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan Trust (collectively, the
"Aurora Plan") covering substantially all employees of Aurora and its wholly-owned subsidiaries who have completed certain service requirements. Effective April 1, 2002, the Aurora Plan was
merged into the Vertex 401(k) Plan, and all employees eligible to participate in the Aurora Plan were offered eligibility to participate in the
Vertex 401(k) Plan. Participants in the Aurora Plan contributed a portion of their compensation to the Aurora Plan through payroll deductions. Company-paid Aurora Plan matching
contributions, if any, were determined by the Company at its sole discretion and payable in the form of cash. The Company's cash contributions under the Aurora Plan totaled $77,000 and $453,000 in
2002 and 2001 respectively.

R. Related Party Transactions

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had a loan outstanding to an officer in the amount of $170,000. The loan is interest free and will be forgiven
prorated over a four-year term ending in the second quarter of 2006.

The
brother of the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was a partner in a law firm representing the Company to which $200,000 in legal fees were paid in 2001. As of
September 24, 2001,

F-32

he
was no longer a partner with that firm and was hired as Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Vertex.

In
January 2002, the Company forgave an interest free loan outstanding to a director in the amount of $132,000 in accordance with the terms of a retention and
non-compete agreement executed by the Company in April 2001.

In
2001, the Company entered into a four year consulting agreement with a director of the Company for the provision of part-time consulting services over a period of
four years at $80,000 per year, commencing in January 2002.

In
April 2001, Aurora entered into an agreement with a customer, which included assay development services, product sales and licenses combined with the purchase of stock in the
customer. At the time of the transaction, the Chief Executive Officer of the customer was a director of Aurora. As of July 18, 2001, upon the acquisition of Aurora by Vertex, the Chief
Executive Officer of the customer was no longer a director of Aurora. The total investment in the customer was approximately $4,120,000 at December 31, 2002 and represented approximately 10% of
the outstanding equity interest in the customer. The stock in the customer was transferred to Invitrogen Corporation in connection with the sale of certain of assets of PanVera LLC on March 28,
2003. The Company believes that the amounts charged by the Company for services, products and licenses are comparable to what the Company would have charged had it not purchased the stock in the
customer and had the former director of Aurora not been affiliated with the customer. The investment was accounted for using the cost method and was included in Investments on the balance sheet at
December 31, 2002. Total revenue recognized
from this agreement was $3,035,000 and $3,348,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. No revenue was recognized in 2003 from this agreement. Revenue recognized from this agreement is included in
discontinued operations on the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

S. Contingencies

The Company has certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues contingent liabilities when it is
probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.

On
September 23, 2003, two purported shareholder class actions,

Carlos Marcano v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, et al.

and

City of Dearborn Heights General Governmental Employees'
Retirement System v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, et al.

, were filed in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming the Company and certain current and former officers and employees of the Company as defendants. Those actions were followed by three additional
lawsuits,

Stephen Anish v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, et al.

,

William Johns v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, et
al.

, and

Ben Harrington v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, et al.

, also filed in the District of Massachusetts. All five cases contain
substantially identical allegations and have been consolidated by the District Court into one lawsuit. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of
material fact regarding VX-745, an investigational agent with potential in the treatment of inflammatory and neurological diseases, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10(b)(5). The plaintiffs seek certification as a class action, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, and unspecified equitable or injunctive relief.
The Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to contest them vigorously.

On
December 17, 2003, a purported class action,

Marguerite Sacchetti v. James C. Blair et al.,

was filed in the Superior Court of the
State of California, County of San Diego, naming as defendants all

F-33

of
the directors of Aurora who approved the merger of Aurora and Vertex, which closed in July 2001. Goldman, Sachs & Co. LLP, a financial advisor to Aurora in the merger transaction, was initially
named as a defendant but the lawsuit has now been dismissed as to Goldman, Sachs. The plaintiffs claim that Aurora's directors breached their fiduciary duty to Aurora by, among other things,
negligently conducting due diligence of Vertex by failing to discover alleged problems with VX-745, a Vertex drug candidate that was the subject of a development program which was terminated by Vertex
in September 2001. The plaintiff seeks certification as a class action, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount and unspecified equitable or injunctive relief. Vertex has certain indemnity
obligations to Aurora's directors under the terms of the merger agreement between Vertex and Aurora, which could result in liability to Vertex for attorney's fees and costs in connection with this
action, as well as for any ultimate judgement which might be awarded. There is an outstanding directors' and officers' liability policy which may cover a significant portion of any such liability. The
defendants are vigorously defending this suit.

T. Guarantees

As permitted under Massachusetts law, Vertex's Articles of Organization and Bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify certain of its officers and directors
for certain claims asserted against them in connection with their service as an officer or director. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under
these indemnification provisions is unlimited. However, the Company has purchased certain directors' and officers' liability insurance policies that reduce its monetary exposure and enable it to
recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal.

Vertex
customarily agrees in the ordinary course of its business to indemnification provisions in agreements with clinical trials investigators in its drug development programs, in
sponsored research agreements with academic and not-for-profit institutions, in various comparable agreements involving parties performing services for the Company in the
ordinary course of business, and in its real estate leases. The Company also customarily agrees to certain indemnification provisions in its drug discovery and development collaboration agreements.
With respect to the Company's clinical trials and sponsored research agreements, these indemnification provisions typically apply to any claim asserted against the investigator or the investigator's
institution relating to personal injury or property damage, violations of law or certain breaches of the Company's contractual obligations arising out of the research or clinical testing of the
Company's compounds or drug candidates. With respect to lease agreements, the indemnification provisions typically apply to claims asserted against the landlord relating to personal injury or property
damage caused by the Company, to violations of law by the Company or to certain breaches of the Company's contractual obligations. The indemnification provisions appearing in the Company's
collaboration agreements are similar, but in addition provide some limited indemnification for its collaborator in the event of third party claims alleging infringement of intellectual property
rights. In each of the cases above, the term of these indemnification provisions generally survives the termination of the agreement, although the provision has the most relevance during the contract
term and for a short period of time thereafter. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these provisions is generally unlimited. Vertex has
purchased insurance policies covering personal injury, property damage and general liability that reduce our exposure for indemnification and would enable us in many cases to recover a portion of any
future amounts paid. The Company has never paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. Accordingly, the Company believes the estimated
fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal.

F-34

Effective
on March 28, 2003 the Company sold certain assets of PanVera LLC to Invitrogen Corporation for approximately $97 million. The agreement with Invitrogen requires
the Company to indemnify Invitrogen against any loss it may suffer by reason of Vertex's breach of certain representations and warranties, or failure to perform certain covenants, contained in the
agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants are of a type customary in agreements of this sort. The Company's aggregate obligations under the indemnity are, with a few exceptions which
the Company believes are not material, capped at one-half of the purchase price, and apply to claims
under representations and warranties made within fifteen months after closing, although there is no corresponding time limit for claims made based on breaches of covenants. The Company believes the
estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal.

Effective
on December 3, 2003, the Company sold certain instrumentation assets to Aurora Discovery, Inc. for approximately $4.3 million. The agreement with Aurora
Discovery, Inc. requires the Company to indemnify Aurora Discovery, Inc. against any loss it may suffer by reason of the Company's breach of certain representations and warranties, or failure to
perform certain covenants, contained in the agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants are of a type customary in agreements of this sort. The Company's aggregate obligations under the
indemnity are capped at one-half of the purchase price, and apply to claims under representations and warranties made within fifteen months after closing, although there is no corresponding time limit
for claims made based on breaches of covenants. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal.

On
February 10, 2004, Vertex entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with UBS Securities LLC in connection with the exchange of approximately $153.1 million
of 2007 Notes for approximately $153.1 million of 2011 Notes. The Dealer Manager Agreement requires the Company to indemnify UBS Securities LLC against any loss it
may suffer by reason of the Company's breach of certain representations and warranties, its failure to perform certain covenants, the inclusion of any untrue statement of material fact in the
materials provided to potential investors in the 2011 Notes, the omission of any material fact needed to make those materials not misleading, and any actions taken by the Company or its
representatives in connection with the exchange of convertible notes. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Dealer Manager Agreement are of a type customary in agreements of this sort.
The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal.
