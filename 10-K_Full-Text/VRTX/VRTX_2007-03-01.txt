BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

We are in the business of discovering, developing and
commercializing small molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases. We
have built a drug discovery capability that integrates biology, chemistry,
biophysics, automation and information technologies, with a goal of making the
drug discovery process more efficient and productive. A Vertex-discovered
compound for the treatment of HIV infection, fosamprenavir calcium, is being
marketed by our collaborator GlaxoSmithKline plc as Lexiva in the United States
and Telzir in Europe. We currently are concentrating most of our drug
development resources on four drug candidates: telaprevir (VX-950) for
the treatment of hepatitis C virus, or HCV, infection, VX-702 for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases, VX-770
for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF, and VX-883 for the treatment
of bacterial infection.

Our lead drug candidate is telaprevir, an oral
hepatitis C protease inhibitor, and one of the most advanced of a new class of
antiviral treatments in development targeting HCV infection, a serious and life-threatening
disease. We are conducting three major Phase 2b clinical trials of telaprevir. We
expect that these three Phase 2b clinical trials together will evaluate
sustained viral response rates in approximately 1,000 patients infected with
genotype 1 HCV, the most prevalent form of HCV, including treatment-naïve
patients and patients who did not achieve sustained viral response with current
therapies. We expect the clinical results from these Phase 2b clinical trials
to provide important information supporting the design and initiation in the
second half of 2007 of a Phase 3 clinical program for telaprevir.

The United States Food and Drug
Administration, or FDA, has granted “Fast-Track” designation to telaprevir. In June 2006,
we entered into a collaboration agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica, N.V., or
Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company, relating to telaprevir. Under
our agreement with Janssen, we have retained exclusive commercial rights to
telaprevir in North America and will lead the clinical development program. Janssen
will be responsible for the commercialization of telaprevir, including the manufacture
of its own commercial supply of telaprevir for the Janssen territories, which
include the territories outside of North America and the Far East. Janssen has
agreed to be responsible for 50% of drug development costs under the
development program for North America and the Janssen territories and to make
additional contingent milestone payments for the successful development,
approval and launch of telaprevir.

In addition to telaprevir, we currently are focusing
on:

·

VX-702,
a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, which we currently are investigating for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, or RA. We are conducting a 12-week,
120 patient Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with RA to evaluate the safety,
tolerability and anti-inflammatory effects of VX-702 on a background of
methotrexate. In January 2007, we commenced a Thorough QTc study, which is a
type of clinical trial required for all small molecule drug candidates prior to
the initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials. Depending on the results of the
12-week Phase 2a clinical trial and the Thorough QTc study, we plan to
conduct a larger six-month Phase 2 clinical trial of VX-702 on a
background of methotrexate.

·

VX-770,
a cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, or CFTR, potentiator, which we are investigating
for the treatment of CF. We recently completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of VX-770
in healthy volunteers and in patients with CF and plan to initiate a Phase 2
clinical trial of VX-770 in patients with CF in the second quarter of
2007.

·

VX-883,
a Vertex-discovered dual-mechanism investigational antibiotic, which is in
preclinical development for the treatment of patients with bacterial infection.
Depending on the outcomes of our preclinical activities, we plan to initiate a
Phase 1 clinical trial of this drug candidate in 2007.

Our pipeline also includes several drug candidates
that are being developed by our collaborators. The most advanced of these drug
candidates is MK-0457 (VX-680), an Aurora kinase inhibitor that is
being


developed by Merck &
Co., Inc. for the treatment of cancer. In December 2006, Merck
announced results from the Phase 1 clinical trials of MK-0457 (VX-680),
which showed that MK-0457 (VX-680) demonstrated clinical activity
in select patients with leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders, and
initiated a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial of MK-0457 (VX-680) in patients with
treatment-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia, or CML, and Philadelphia
chromosome-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia, or Ph+ ALL, containing the
T315I BCR-ABL mutation. We also are collaborating with Merck on the development
of other Aurora kinase inhibitors.

We plan to continue adding
promising drug candidates to our development pipeline through our ongoing
commitment to discovery research. As we have matured as a company by advancing
our drug candidates to later stage development, we have chosen to retain
greater development control and commercial rights to some of our drug
candidates in order retain a greater proportion of the potential value of those
drug candidates if they are successfully commercialized. In the future, we
expect that we will retain control of clinical development and the right to
market some of our drug candidates in therapeutic and geographic areas where we
have or believe we can build sufficient expertise to independently market the
drug candidate, if it is approved, on a cost-effective basis.

In order to complete the clinical
development program for telaprevir and prepare to market telaprevir in North
America if it is approved, we are investing significant resources to expand our
capabilities with respect to clinical development, regulatory affairs and
quality control, and to build and manage a commercial supply chain. We also
expect to incur significant costs in 2007 to manufacture registration batches
of

telaprevir

and build

telaprevir

commercial inventory.

OUR STRATEGY

Our goal is to become a fully integrated
pharmaceutical company with industry-leading capabilities in research,
development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. The key elements
of our strategy are:

Focus on the development and commercialization of
telaprevir.

We plan to invest significant resources
in the clinical development and preparation for launch of telaprevir. We have
designed a comprehensive clinical development program for telaprevir consisting
of multiple concurrent clinical trials that will study the profile of
telaprevir. In addition, we are investing in building and managing a commercial
supply chain for telaprevir, including purchasing significant quantities of
long lead-time raw materials and identifying and entering into relationships
with third-party manufacturers, in order to support a timely launch of
telaprevir if we are successful in completing development and obtaining
marketing approval.

Capitalize on the advances in our telaprevir clinical
program to build our general drug development and commercialization capabilities.

We believe that the progress we made in
2006 and in particular the advances we made in the development of telaprevir
have positioned us to expand our general drug development and commercialization

capabilities. In
2007, we plan to invest in key areas—including clinical development, regulatory
affairs, quality control, commercial operations and commercial supply chain
management—that will be necessary in order to complete development of
telaprevir, to seek approval for telaprevir and to commercialize telaprevir if
we are successful in obtaining marketing approval. We expect that these
capabilities also will support realization of additional drug candidates that
may progress through our pipeline.

Invest in research and
development and retain a greater proportion of rights to proprietary drug
candidates.

We intend to continue to invest
significant amounts in our research and development programs. In the future, we
expect that we will fund a greater proportion of our research programs than in
past years, using internal funds rather than collaborator funds. We believe
that this strategy will ultimately allow us to retain greater development
control of, and commercial rights to, those proprietary drug candidates that
may meet our strategic internal investment criteria as in effect from time to
time.

Support a broad-based
portfolio of drug candidates, including the introduction of multiple drug
candidates into development.

We have elected to diversify our
research and development activities across a relatively


broad array of investment
opportunities, due in part to the high risks associated with the biotechnology
and pharmaceutical business. We plan to continue to add promising potential drug
candidates to our development pipeline through our continuing commitment to
discovery research.

Continue existing and
establish new collaborations to develop and commercialize selected drug
candidates.

Collaborations with pharmaceutical
companies have played an important role in helping us advance our drug
discovery capabilities as well as to grow and advance our drug candidate pipeline.
Collaborations provide us with financial support and other valuable resources
for our research programs, development resources for our drug candidates and
marketing and sales support for our products. We plan to continue to rely on
collaborators to develop and commercialize certain of our drug candidates
either worldwide, in collaboration with us, or in markets in which we are not
currently concentrating our resources.

License and acquire technologies, resources and
products.

In addition to collaborations, we also seek opportunistically
to license and acquire technologies, resources and drugs that have the
potential to

strengthen our
drug discovery platform, pipeline and commercial capabilities.

Appropriately manage our
capital resources in order to execute our strategy.

We are focused on maintaining a
financial profile that will enable us to execute our business strategy. In
2006, we increased our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance
and reduced our outstanding debt as a result of payments received from
collaborators and a series of capital transactions that offset significant
operating expenses. We expect to continue to pursue a general financing
strategy that may lead us to undertake one or more additional capital
transactions.

The
drug candidates on which we are currently concentrating most of our drug
development resources, along with the drugs and drug candidates we have
developed or are developing with collaborators, are set forth in the following

treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. Lexiva/Telzir has replaced Agenerase in
worldwide markets.


Principal Areas of
Focus

Telaprevir (VX-950) (investigational oral
hepatitis C protease inhibitor for the treatment of chronic HCV infection)

Telaprevir, our most
advanced drug candidate, is an oral hepatitis C protease inhibitor. Telaprevir
is designed to inhibit NS3-4A serine protease, an enzyme thought to be
necessary for HCV replication. The FDA has granted “Fast-Track” designation to telaprevir.
We are conducting three major Phase 2b clinical trials of telaprevir, which we
refer to as the PROVE clinical trials, as part of a global development
program to determine the safety and antiviral activity of telaprevir. We expect
the clinical results from these Phase 2b clinical trials to provide important
information supporting the design and initiation in the second half of 2007 of a
Phase 3 clinical program for telaprevir. We believe that the current PROVE clinical
trials have the potential to generate sufficient safety and efficacy data in a
broad range of genotype 1 HCV patients, together with safety data from the
proposed Phase 3 program, to support a New Drug Application, or NDA, filing in
late 2008. If efficacy data from the Phase 3 program is required for the NDA, the
NDA filing may be later than 2008.

Under our agreement with
Janssen, we have retained exclusive commercial rights to telaprevir in North
America and will lead the clinical development program in North America and the
Janssen territories. Janssen has the right to market telaprevir in the rest of
the world, except for Japan and certain Far East countries, where we are
collaborating with Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation. Janssen has agreed to be
responsible for 50% of drug development costs under the development program for
North America and the Janssen territories and to make additional contingent
milestone payments for the successful development, approval and launch of
telaprevir. Janssen will be responsible for the commercialization of
telaprevir, including the manufacture of its own commercial supply of
telaprevir, outside of North America and the Far East.

In 2007, we anticipate a
clinical trial exploring twice-daily dosing of telaprevir will be initiated and
that Janssen will conduct this clinical trial through Tibotec, a separate
Johnson & Johnson company. In addition in 2007, we expect to expand
the clinical development of telaprevir into patients with genotype 2 and
genotype 3 HCV infection.  In 2006, Mitsubishi
conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial of telaprevir in the Far East. Mitsubishi is
designing a Phase 2 clinical program for telaprevir in the Far East.

We have begun to identify
and enter into commercial relationships with third-party manufacturers that
will be necessary in order to manufacture commercial quantities of telaprevir. In
2007, we expect to manufacture registration batches of telaprevir, and invest
in telaprevir commercial supply in order to support a timely launch if we are
successful in obtaining regulatory marketing approval for telaprevir.

Telaprevir was discovered
in our collaboration, now ended, with Eli Lilly and Company. We hold worldwide
rights to all other second-generation HCV protease inhibitors discovered
by us during our collaboration with Eli Lilly. We will owe Eli Lilly royalties
on any future sales of telaprevir, if approved, and certain other HCV protease
inhibitors.

Background: Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus
Infection

HCV infection causes
chronic inflammation in the liver. The World Health Organization estimates that
there are as many as 170 million people chronically infected with HCV
worldwide and that an additional 3 million to 4 million people are
infected each year. Reports published by the American Association for the Study
of Liver Disease have estimated that approximately 3.4 million people in
the United States are chronically infected with HCV, and the American Liver
Foundation estimates that 8,000 to 10,000 people in the United States die as a
result of HCV infection each year.

Currently, there is no
vaccine available to prevent HCV infection. The current standard treatment for genotype 1
HCV infection is a combination of pegylated interferon, or peg-IFN, and
ribavirin, or RBV, administered for up to 48 weeks. This treatment regimen
is associated with significant side effects, including fatigue, flu-like symptoms,
depression and anemia. Among patients who begin treatment, approximately 50% of
patients infected with genotype 1 HCV, the most common HCV genotype in the


United
States, fail to either complete treatment or show a long-term sustained
response to therapy. As a result, we believe new safe and effective treatment
options for HCV infection are needed.

Telaprevir Development Program

We are conducting three
major Phase 2b clinical trials of telaprevir. PROVE 1 is ongoing in the
United States and PROVE 2 is ongoing in European Union, both in
treatment-naïve patients. PROVE 3 has commenced and is being conducted with
patients in North America and the European Union who did not achieve sustained
viral response with previous interferon-based treatments. PROVE 1 and PROVE 2
are fully enrolled, and we commenced patient enrollment in PROVE 3 in January 2007.

PROVE 1
and PROVE 2

We expect that
together, the PROVE 1 and PROVE 2 clinical trials will evaluate rates
of sustained viral response, or SVR, in approximately 580 treatment-naïve
patients infected with genotype 1 HCV, including patients who will receive
telaprevir and patients in the control arms. SVR is defined as undetectable
viral levels 24 weeks after all treatment has ceased.

A
description of each of the clinical trial arms for the PROVE 1 and
PROVE 2 clinical trials, including the intended number of patients in each
trial, is set forth in the following table:

The PROVE 1
and PROVE 2 clinical trials together have the following four key objectives:

·

to
evaluate the optimal SVR rate that can be achieved with telaprevir therapy in
combination with peg-IFN and RBV;

·

to
evaluate the optimal treatment duration for telaprevir combination therapy;

·

to
evaluate the role of RBV in telaprevir-based therapy; and

·

to
evaluate the safety of telaprevir in combination with peg-IFN and RBV.

In the PROVE 1 and PROVE 2
clinical trials, patients receive telaprevir in a tablet formulation at a dose
of 750 mg every eight hours for 12 weeks. The PROVE 1 clinical trial is
double-blinded and placebo-controlled, and the PROVE 2 clinical trial is
partially-blinded and placebo-controlled.

In December 2006, we
announced results from a planned interim safety and antiviral activity analysis
that was conducted and reviewed by the independent data monitoring committee
overseeing the PROVE 1 clinical trial. As of the cut-off date of the
interim analysis, a total of 250 patients had been enrolled in the PROVE 1
clinical trial and received at least one dose of telaprevir or placebo. In the
data reported, the patients in all three telaprevir-containing arms (approximately
175 patients) were pooled together and the results were compared to the results
in the control arm of peg-IFN and RBV and placebo (approximately 75 patients).

At the time of the data
cut-off for the safety analysis, approximately 100 patients had completed 12 weeks
on-study and more than 200 patients had completed eight weeks. The most
common adverse


events
were similar in type between the two groups. Of these, the adverse events that
were more commonly reported in the telaprevir arms included gastrointestinal
disorders and rash. In the telaprevir groups, 9% of patients had discontinued
treatment due to adverse events, including 3% as a result of rash, compared to
3% of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events in the control
arm. The difference between the two groups is due to the greater number of
discontinuations due to rash, gastrointestinal disorders, and anemia in the
telaprevir arms compared to the control arm. Serious adverse events were noted
in 3% of patients in the telaprevir groups and 1% of patients in the control
group.

PROVE 3

In the
PROVE 3 clinical trial, we expect to evaluate SVR rates in approximately 440
patients infected with genotype 1 HCV located in North America and the European
Union who did not achieve SVR with previous interferon-based treatments. We
expect to complete enrollment in this double-blinded and placebo-controlled
clinical trial by the end of the second quarter of 2007. Patients in the telaprevir
arms of the PROVE 3 clinical trial will receive telaprevir in a tablet
formulation at a dose of 750 mg every eight hours for 12 weeks or 24 weeks.

The PROVE 3
clinical trial has the following two key objectives:

·

to
evaluate the SVR rate that can be achieved with telaprevir therapy in
combination with peg-IFN and RBV in patients who have not achieved SVR with
previous interferon-based treatments; and

·

to
evaluate the safety profile of telaprevir administered in a 24-week
course of therapy of telaprevir in combination with peg-IFN and RBV.

Previous
Trials

From late 2004 through
early 2006, we conducted a series of small-scale clinical trials of telaprevir
in healthy volunteers and HCV-infected patients designed to evaluate safety,
pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of telaprevir. The first of these
trials, a Phase 1 clinical trial of telaprevir in healthy volunteers, was
completed in 2004. The next two trials were Phase 1b trials conducted in 2005—a
trial of telaprevir as monotherapy completed early in 2005, and a trial of telaprevir
dosed together with peg-IFN completed later in 2005. We also conducted a small
Phase 2a combination therapy clinical trial of telaprevir dosed with peg-IFN
and RBV, which was completed in 2006. The results of these earlier trials
supported the design and initiation of the ongoing PROVE clinical trials. The results
of these trials represent clinical treatment of small numbers of patients who
were initially dosed in clinical trials of telaprevir for short durations and
may not be predictive of patient outcomes in large clinical trials evaluating
telaprevir.


VX-702 (oral p38 MAP kinase inhibitor for the
treatment of RA and other inflammatory diseases)

VX-702 is our oral
p38 mitogen-activated protein, or MAP, kinase inhibitor, which we are currently
investigating for the treatment of RA. In March 2006, we reported data from
our three-month Phase 2 clinical trial of VX-702 in patients
with RA. In this trial, VX-702 demonstrated statistically significant
clinical effects on signs and symptoms of RA as measured by ACR


criteria, as well as several other widely used
clinical measures. However, we believe that the levels of improvement shown in
this trial did not warrant further development of VX-702 as a single agent for
the treatment of RA. We are conducting a 12-week, 120-patient Phase 2a
clinical trial in patients with RA to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
anti-inflammatory effects of VX-702 on a background of methotrexate. In January 2007,
we started a Thorough QTc study of VX-702. The FDA requires that
companies conduct a Thorough QTc study of any small molecule drug candidate
prior to the commencement of Phase 3 clinical trials. Depending on the results of the 12-week
Phase 2a clinical trial and the Thorough QTc study, we plan to conduct a larger
six-month Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with RA of VX-702 on a
background of methotrexate.

We hold worldwide
development and commercialization rights to VX-702, except for Japan and
certain Far East countries, where we are collaborating with Kissei
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. In 2006, Kissei completed a Phase 1 clinical
trial of VX-702 in Japan in RA.

Background

p38 MAP Kinase Inhibitors for Inflammatory Diseases

The MAP kinases are a
family of structurally-related human enzymes involved in intracellular
signaling pathways that enable cells to respond to their environment. The p38
MAP kinase is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the onset
and progression of inflammation. When activated, the p38 MAP kinase
triggers production of multiple cytokines, including interleukin-1, or IL-1,
TNF-alpha and interleukin-6, or IL-6. Excess levels of IL-1
and TNF-alpha are associated with a number of acute and chronic inflammatory
diseases.

We have extensive
preclinical and clinical experience with p38 MAP kinase inhibitors, which we
believe may be a useful new class of oral anti-inflammatory drugs.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis, a
systemic disease, is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. RA has a
prevalence of about 1% of the worldwide population and an annual incidence of 3
cases per 10,000 adults. RA causes pain, swelling and loss of function in
affected joints. The disease is often accompanied by significant morbidity and
mortality. Patients with RA also have a significant impairment in their quality
of life.

The current first line
standard treatment for RA is administration of a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic
drug, or DMARD, most commonly methotrexate. Injectable anti-tumor
necrosis factor, or TNF, agents such as Enbrel

®

(etanercept), Humira

®

(adalimumab) and Remicade

®

(infliximab), generally on a background of
methotrexate, are used when disease activity is not controlled by DMARDs and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We believe that an oral
agent that successfully targets TNF production may provide an attractive
treatment option for patients with RA.

VX-702 Development Program

In March 2006, we
obtained results from our 315-patient three-month Phase 2 clinical trial
of VX-702, in RA which we refer to as the VeRA trial. A total of 278
patients completed 12 weeks of treatment in this double-blind,
randomized and placebo-controlled trial. Patients received either 5 mg or
10 mg of VX-702 once daily, or placebo. In addition to VX-702,
patients could receive certain DMARDs, but could not receive methotrexate or
anti-TNF therapies. At the end of 12 weeks, patients completed dosing with
VX-702 and were evaluated for improvement in clinical signs and symptoms
according to American College of Rheumatology criteria, or ACR


. ACR


is a standardized measure based on a patient’s


attainment
of at least a 20% improvement in ACR-specified indicators of RA activity. In
comparing differences in outcomes between treatments in a clinical trial,
statistical significance testing is used to establish the probability that the
observed differences did not occur by chance. The result of statistical testing
is often defined in terms of a “p-value,” with a level of 0.05 or less
considered to be a statistically significant difference.

In this clinical trial,
treatment with VX-702 led to a dose-dependent, statistically significant
increase in week 12 ACR


response rates,
the primary endpoint of the clinical trial. Thirty percent of patients
receiving placebo, 38% of patients receiving 5 mg daily of VX-702 and 40%
of patients receiving 10 mg daily of VX-702 achieved an ACR


response at week 12 (p-value=0.04;
Jonckheere-Terpstra test for increasing dose-response). In addition, 32%
of placebo patients, 41% of 5 mg VX-702-treated patients and 44% of
10 mg VX-702-treated patients achieved a EULAR (moderate or good) response
(p=0.01). EULAR is another standardized measure of indicators of RA under
criteria specified by the European League Against Rheumatism. Dose-dependent
statistically significant effects also were seen on tender joint counts
(p=0.007), swollen joint counts (p=0.003), disease activity score (DAS28;
p=0.02) and morning stiffness (p=0.03).

In 2004, we completed a Phase 2a
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation
clinical trial of VX-702 for the treatment of patients with acute
coronary syndrome, or ACS, undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, or
PCI, such as stent placement. p38 MAP kinase regulates the production of key
inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of ACS. This Phase 2a
trial of VX-702 was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
pharmacokinetics of VX-702 in 45 patients with unstable angina and
elevated levels of c-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation measured in the
blood, undergoing PCI. In the Phase 2a ACS trial, there were no clinically
significant differences between treatment and placebo groups with respect to
adverse events, and VX-702 met pre-established safety and pharmacokinetic
objectives.

Clinical trials of a
number of other p38 MAP kinase inhibitors have demonstrated dose-dependent
elevations in liver enzymes, which generally are thought to be markers for
liver injury. In 2004, we completed a 28-day trial of VX-702 in
healthy volunteers designed specifically to evaluate the effect of VX-702
on liver enzymes. This trial showed some transient elevations in liver enzymes
in a small number of subjects. However, the magnitude of those enzyme
elevations did not reach clinical significance and did not require
discontinuation of dosing. The enzyme levels returned to normal during
continued dosing.

In the VeRA trial, premature
discontinuations for adverse events across the trial arms were: placebo (2%), 5
mg (3%) and 10 mg (5%). No clinically significant adverse effects were seen on
laboratory parameters, including liver function tests. The most common adverse
events that led to treatment discontinuation in patients receiving VX-702
were seen in two patients each and were: gastroenteritis, nausea/vomiting,
rash, and renal impairment (increased serum creatinine levels to 1.2 to 1.5
times upper limit of normal). The most common adverse events were generally
mild or moderate and were: infection (5% of placebo patients and 10% of VX-702
patients), gastrointestinal disorders (6% placebo and 8% VX-702), and
skin disorders (0% placebo and 9% VX-702). In electrocardiograms
conducted during the VeRA trial, increases in QT interval (a measure of
electrical conduction in the heart) were seen in the VX-702 treatment groups,
but no patient in the VeRA trial experienced a clinically significant (60 msec
or approximately 15%) increase in the Fridericia rate-corrected QT interval. We
expect that Thorough QTc trial currently underway will provide additional
information on the effects of VX-702 on electrical conduction in the heart.

VX-770 (investigational oral CFTR potentiator
for the treatment of cystic fibrosis)

VX-770 is a small
molecule drug candidate designed to potentiate the gating activity of the CFTR
protein, a chloride ion transporter on the cell surface that is functionally
defective in patients with cystic fibrosis. We submitted an Investigational New
Drug, or IND, application with the FDA and completed a Phase 1 clinical
trial of VX-770 in 2006. VX-770 received both “Fast Track” and
“Orphan Drug” designations from the FDA in 2006.


VX-770 was
discovered by us in our ongoing research collaboration with Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated, or CFFT, and with the support and
participation of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. We hold worldwide development
and commercialization rights to VX-770. We would be required to pay CFFT
royalties on any future sales of VX-770.

Cystic fibrosis is a
genetic disease afflicting approximately 30,000 people in the United States.
The symptoms of cystic fibrosis, particularly the development of thick mucous
that causes lung tissue inflammation and, ultimately, irreversible lung damage,
are caused by defects in the CFTR protein. A leading hypothesis is that mucous
accumulates in the lung due to improper water and salt (including chloride ion)
transport across the cell surface membrane. Using our expertise in ion
channels, including high-content cell assays and medicinal chemistry, we have identified
selective ion channel modulators for potential application to the treatment of CF.
VX-770 may work by increasing the frequency with which the CFTR channel
is open, which could result in an increase in chloride transport across the
cell membrane. In laboratory studies involving bronchial epithelial cells
isolated from cystic fibrosis patients, our researchers have demonstrated that
potentiator compounds may improve CFTR function.

In 2006, we completed a Phase 1
clinical trial of VX-770 in 63 individuals, including healthy volunteers
and patients with CF. Healthy volunteers in the Phase 1 trial received
escalating doses of VX-770 for treatment durations of up to 14 days, and
patients with CF received single doses of VX-770.  A rash was observed in some subjects during
the multi-dose arm of the trial. However, we believe that the trial results
support a Phase 2 clinical trial of VX-770. We plan to initiate this
Phase 2 clinical trial of VX-770 in patients with CF in the second
quarter of 2007.

VX-883 (gyrase inhibition for the treatment of
bacterial infection)

VX-883 is a novel,
Vertex-discovered dual-mechanism investigational antibiotic currently in
preclinical development that targets both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. DNA
gyrase and topoisomerase IV are enzymes that are essential to bacteria during
the replication process. DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV inhibitors already on
the market have proven to be potent, broad-spectrum antibiotics and are
used to treat a variety of common Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial
infections in various treatment settings. While existing gyrase and
topoisomerase IV inhibitors work by interacting with the GyrA and ParC subunits
of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, VX-883 targets the GyrB and ParE
subunits. VX-883 is active,

in vitro

,
against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens prevalent in both
community and hospital settings, including certain pathogens that are less
susceptible to other classes of antibiotics, such as agents targeting the other
subunits of gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Accordingly, we believe that VX-883
may be useful in treating infections caused by drug resistant bacteria,
including methicillin-resistant

Staphylococcus aureus

,
commonly referred to as MRSA, a major and growing problem with currently
marketed antibiotics. Depending on the outcomes of specific preclinical
activities we are conducting in early 2007, we plan to initiate a Phase 1
clinical trial of VX-883 later in 2007.

We hold worldwide
development and commercial rights to VX-883.

Collaborator-Led
Programs

Lexiva/Telzir: HIV protease inhibition for the
treatment of HIV/AIDS (GlaxoSmithKline plc)

Infection with HIV can
lead to AIDS, a severe, life-threatening impairment of the immune system.
According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, an estimated 39.5
million people worldwide were living with HIV in 2006. The United States
National Institutes of Health has estimated that there may be as many as
950,000 individuals in the United States infected with HIV. There are four
classes of antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of HIV infection and
AIDS: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as AZT and 3TC;
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as efavirenz; the fusion
inhibitor enfuvirtide; and HIV protease inhibitors, or HIV PIs. HIV PIs are
used as part of combination regimens for the treatment of HIV. HIV PIs block
the cleavage of HIV polyproteins into active proteins, and result in the
production of non-infectious viral particles. The HIV PI ritonavir has


been
shown to significantly boost the levels of certain other PIs in the bloodstream
and therefore co-administration of HIV PIs with ritonavir has become
progressively more frequent in clinical practice as a strategy for achieving
maximum antiviral activity, reducing the likelihood of treatment failure (viral
breakthrough), and lowering the overall pill count for patients. Sales of HIV
PIs in the United States exceeded $2.0 billion (excluding ritonavir) in
2006, an increase of approximately 14% from 2005. The United States market for
HIV PIs is highly competitive, with a number of HIV PIs currently on the
market.

Our HIV PI, fosamprenavir
calcium, is marketed by our collaborator GlaxoSmithKline under the name Lexiva
in the United States and under the name Telzir in the European Union.
Lexiva/Telzir was co-discovered by us and GlaxoSmithKline and was developed by
GlaxoSmithKline under our collaboration with them. GlaxoSmithKline has
worldwide marketing rights for Lexiva/Telzir, and we have the right to conduct
certain promotional and educational activities for Lexiva/Telzir in the United
States and the European Union. We also have the right, which we have not
exercised, to supply bulk drug substance to GlaxoSmithKline. We receive
royalties on GlaxoSmithKline’s sales of Lexiva/Telzir.

Lexiva/Telzir is a prodrug
of amprenavir, which also was discovered and developed under our collaboration
with GlaxoSmithKline and marketed under the name Agenerase. Lexiva/Telzir
has replaced Agenerase in worldwide markets. A prodrug is an inactive compound
that is metabolized by the body to become the active drug. Due to the physical
properties of prodrugs such as Lexiva/Telzir, it is possible to achieve a
higher effective dose of the active drug for each prodrug pill administered, resulting
in a smaller pill burden for patients.

In September 2006,
GlaxoSmithKline announced with us at the 46th Annual Interscience Conference on
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, or ICAAC, data from a randomized, open-label,
multicenter international Phase 3b clinical trial comparing the safety and
efficacy of Lexiva in combination with ritonavir to lopinavir in combination
with ritonavir. The analysis of this clinical trial presented at ICAAC
describes the virologic response and resistance patterns associated with virologic
failure. At 48 weeks, four percent of the 434 patients in the Lexiva/ritonavir
arm and five percent of the 444 patients in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm
experienced virologic failure, which was defined as either a failure to achieve
plasma HIV-1 RNA of less than 400c/mL by week 24, or confirmed rebound in plasma
HIV-1 RNA to greater than 400 c/mL.

Lexiva was launched in the
United States in late 2003, and in certain European Union countries in the
third quarter of 2004. In 2006, Lexiva generated the third largest sales
revenues among HIV PI inhibitors in the United States, excluding ritonavir, and
it currently holds an approximate 11% share of the United States HIV PI market
based on total prescriptions (also excluding ritonavir). Lexiva/Telzir is
currently approved for sale in approximately 45 countries worldwide, including
the United States, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and
Canada.

MK-0457 (VX-680) and MK-6592 (VX-667): Aurora
kinase inhibition for the treatment of cancer (Merck & Co., Inc.)

We are collaborating with
Merck in the area of Aurora kinase inhibitors, including MK-0457 (VX-680),
MK-6592 (VX-667) and additional potential follow-on compounds.
Aurora kinases are enzymes thought to play multiple roles in the development
and progression of cancer, acting as regulators of cell proliferation,
transforming normal cells into cancer cells and downregulating p53, one of the
body’s natural tumor suppressors. MK-0457 (VX-680) is a potent inhibitor of
Aurora kinases and of flt-3 kinase, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is
known to be inappropriately activated in several different types of leukemia. We
believe that inhibitors of Aurora kinases may be useful as highly targeted
treatments for a range of oncology indications.

As part of the
collaboration, we conducted a joint research program with Merck to characterize
MK-0457 (VX-680) activity across a broad range of cancer types and to identify
additional drug candidates targeting the Aurora kinases. Merck holds worldwide
development and commercialization rights to


MK-0457
(VX-680), MK-6592 (VX-667) and certain additional compounds identified
during the research program.

MK-0457 (VX-680)

In December 2006,
Merck initiated a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial of MK-0457 (VX-680) in
patients with treatment-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia, or CML, and
Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia, or Ph+ ALL, containing
the T315I BCR-ABL mutation based on encouraging results from a Phase 1
clinical trial of MK-0457 (VX-680). This clinical trial is expected to enroll
approximately 270 patients. In the trial, MK-0457 (VX-680) will be given as a
five-day intravenous infusion every two to three weeks to evaluate both
safety and efficacy.

In December 2006,
Merck also reported the results of its Phase 1 clinical trial for MK-0457
(VX-680) in patients with CML, in patients with Ph+ ALL with the T315I BCR-ABL
mutation and in patients with refractory JAK-2 positive myeloproliferative
diseases. Merck reported that the Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial
evaluated 44 adult patients with advanced leukemias and myeloproliferative
disorders who were treated with MK-0457 (VX-680) given as a five-day
intravenous infusion every two-to-three weeks. Out of the 15 patients with
refractory CML, nine patients had a T315I BCR-ABL mutation. Eight of these nine
T315I patients had either a hematologic and/or cytogenetic response to MK-0457
(VX-680) following multiple cycles of treatment. The six patients without the
T315I BCR-ABL mutation (of the 15 patients with refractory CML) did not
exhibit any clinical responses to administration of MK-0457 (VX-680).

Merck also reported that
two patients in the clinical trial with Ph+ ALL carrying the T315I mutation had
either hematologic and/or cytogenetic responses, including one patient who had
a clinical response with a full molecular remission. Six of nine patients with
myeloproliferative disorders having the V617F activating mutation in JAK-2
also had clinical responses. These clinical responses were consistent with drug
effects observed in leukemic cells.

The Phase 1 clinical
trial of MK-0457 (VX-680) was designed primarily to evaluate the safety of VX-680
given as a five-day continuous infusion, to determine maximum tolerated dose
and dose-limiting toxicities, and to assess pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics. Merck reported that no drug-related non-hematological
toxicities were observed with MK-0457 (VX-680) in the clinical trial and
therefore a maximum-tolerated dose has not yet been established. Side effects
were observed in the clinical trial and included a lower white blood cell count,
nausea, hair loss, and inflammation in the mouth.

Merck also is conducting a
Phase 2a clinical trial of MK-0457 (VX-680) in patients with lung cancer,
a Phase 1 clinical trial of MK-0457 (VX-680) in patients with recurrent or
non-responsive solid tumors and a Phase 1 clinical trial of MK-0457
(VX-680) in patients with solid tumor and/or colorectal cancer.

Vertex researchers
published the three-dimensional atomic structure of Aurora-A kinase
in 2002, and published the structure of flt-3 kinase in January 2004.
We also presented preclinical data in a number of research and medical venues
in 2003 suggesting that MK-0457 (VX-680) should be further investigated to
determine its potential to treat several different cancer types for which there
are currently few or no available treatments. In a paper published in February 2004,
our researchers reported demonstrating for the first time that a selective
small molecule inhibitor of Aurora kinase MK-0457 (VX-680) inhibited tumor
growth and induced tumor regression in xenograft models of human pancreatic and
colon cancer. In addition, our researchers have presented data showing that MK-0457
(VX-680) prolonged survival and induced sustained remission in an oncogene-driven
model of acute myelocytic leukemia.

MK-6592 (VX-667)

In 2005, Merck selected MK-6592
(VX-667), a second Aurora kinase inhibitor, for preclinical development. In
December 2006

,
Merck initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of MK-6592 (VX-667)
in oncology patients with advanced solid tumors.


AVN-944 (VX-944):

IMPDH
inhibition for the treatment of cancer (Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)

Our collaborator Avalon
Pharmaceuticals is developing AVN-944 (VX-944), an IMPDH inhibitor, for the
treatment of advanced hematological malignancies, such as leukemia, lymphoma or
myeloma. Inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase, or IMPDH, is an enzyme thought
to be critical for the synthesis of quanosine triphosphate, a molecule required
for DNA synthesis and cellular signalling. IMPDH is over-expressed in many
cancer cells, especially for hemotological malignancies. Reports in medical
literature and presentations at scientific conferences provide a clinical
rationale for the development of IMPDH inhibitors for the treatment of
hematologic malignancies. Results from certain preclinical studies of AVN-944
(VX-944) indicated that AVN-944 (VX-944) inhibited the

in vitro

proliferation of lymphoid and
myeloid cells, the principal cells involved in the most common types of human
leukemias. AVN-944 (VX-944) also significantly prolonged survival in a model of
aggressive mouse leukemia. In a single-dose, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical
trial of AVN-944 (VX-944) in healthy volunteers, data indicated that AVN-944
(VX-944) was orally bioavailable.

In January 2006,
Avalon initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States of AVN-944
(VX-944) in patients with advanced hematological cancer. In December 2006,
Avalon announced interim results from an ongoing open-label, repeat
dose-escalation clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability
of AVN-944 (VX-944) in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies and to
determine the optimal dose for Phase 2 clinical trials. Avalon reported that AVN-944
(VX-944) demonstrated a statistically meaningful impact on IMPDH and other certain
genes that are known to be involved with cancer, including nucleotide
biosynthesis, energy and metabolism, DNA replication, apoptosis and cell cycle
control.

Avalon holds worldwide
development and commercialization rights to AVN-944 (VX-944).

VX-409:

Selective
sodium channel modulation for the treatment of pain (GlaxoSmithKline plc)

GlaxoSmithKline is leading
the development of VX-409, an oral, subtype-selective sodium
channel modulator, and certain additional back-up compounds as potential drug
candidates for the treatment of pain. VX-409 and the backup compounds
were discovered through our San Diego-based ion channel research program
using the capabilities and proprietary technologies that are unique to that
site.

GlaxoSmithKline holds
worldwide development and commercialization rights to VX-409 and certain backup
compounds.

Other Programs

We have a number of additional drug candidates. These drug
candidates include the following drug candidates for which we may consider
entering into collaborative arrangements in order to advance their development.

VX-692 (gyrase inhibition
for the treatment of bacterial infection)

VX-692
is a novel,

Vertex-discovered investigational antibiotic, which targets
both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and is active,

in vitro

,
against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. We are currently
evaluating VX-692 in preclinical development. We hold worldwide
development and commercial rights to VX-692.

VX-166 (caspase inhibition for the treatment of liver disease and
sepsis)

VX-166 is a novel,
Vertex-discovered inhibitor of multiple caspases. Inhibition of caspases
has been shown to inhibit apoptosis, a critical component in the pathology of
several liver diseases and the onset and progression of sepsis. We have
demonstrated in animal models that administration of VX-166 may be useful in
the treatment of such indications as acute liver disease and sepsis. We hold
worldwide rights to VX-166.


VX-765 (ICE
inhibition for the treatment of inflammatory diseases)

We discovered and have completed certain development
activities with respect to two interleukin-1 converting enzyme, or ICE,
inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, VX-765 and
pralnacasan. ICE is an enzyme that controls the release of active IL-1
(one of two forms of IL-1) and IL-18, which have been
correlated with disease states in a number of acute and chronic inflammatory
diseases. Phase 1 clinical trials of VX-765 in healthy volunteers
demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in levels of IL-18, the
first time this has been demonstrated for any therapeutic agent. During 2005,
we completed the clinical portion of our four week, Phase 2a clinical
trial of VX-765, in 68 patients with psoriasis. We believe these
results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to date warrant further investigation
of VX-765.

Our first generation
ICE inhibitor, pralnacasan, was developed in collaboration with Sanofi-Aventis
(then Aventis). Phase 2 clinical trials of pralnacasan conducted by
Aventis suggested that treatment with pralnacasan produced positive anti-inflammatory
effects in patients with RA and led to dose-dependent suppression of
the production of IL-1. In 2003, Aventis and Vertex voluntarily
suspended the clinical development of pralnacasan pending full analysis of
findings that emerged from a nine-month nonclinical toxicology study. In
that nonclinical study, high doses of pralnacasan were associated with the
development of fibrosis in circumscribed areas of the liver of one species of
animal.

Merimepodib (VX-497)
(IMPDH inhibition for the treatment of autoimmune diseases)

We currently are
completing the data analysis phase of our Phase 2b clinical trial of
merimepodib, an oral, small molecule inhibitor of inosine 5-monophosphate
dehydrogenase, or IMPDH, for the treatment of HCV infection. The goal of this
clinical trial, referred to as the METRO trial, was to evaluate the safety,
pharmacokinetics and efficacy of merimepodib in combination with peg-IFN
and RBV. In the HCV field, we currently are focusing our efforts on the
development of direct antivirals such as telaprevir. We currently do not plan
to conduct additional merimepodib clinical trials in HCV infection after the
METRO trial is completed. Significant research on the IMPDH pathway has
demonstrated its potential utility in transplant and other autoimmune
indications.

RESEARCH PROGRAMS

We believe that our integrated drug design approach
has significantly enhanced our ability to discover and develop small molecule
drug candidates directed at biologically complex targets, including novel
targets identified by genomic research. We believe that our approach has been
validated through our ability to interest prospective collaborators in our
research output and by our success in moving drug candidates into clinical
trials.

We have recently decided to focus on
several core disease areas, in order to expand and develop our expertise and
leadership in specific disease areas and to permit a framework for portfolio
planning and execution. Currently, the four disease areas of highest priority to
us are:  infectious diseases;
immunological/inflammatory diseases; cancer; and neurological diseases and
disorders.  These disease areas were
selected by mapping our research strengths onto disease areas with high unmet
need, with an emphasis on indications where we believe we, independently or in
collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies, will be able to discover,
develop, and commercialize transforming medicines consistent with our core
purpose. Within each disease area, we intend to specialize in specific indications.

Integrated Drug Innovation
Approach.

Our
drug design platform integrates biology,

pharmacology,
drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, toxicology, material sciences,
biophysics, medicinal chemistry and process chemistry,

automation and
information technologies in a coordinated and simultaneous fashion throughout
the discovery process. The goal of our integrated, interdisciplinary approach
is to make the drug discovery and development process more efficient and
productive.

Focused Drug Discovery in
Target-Rich Gene Families.

We have pioneered a novel approach to drug discovery
in target-rich gene families, which are groups of genes with similar sequences
that code for structurally similar proteins. We organize and cluster targets
within a gene family according to how they


interact with
chemical inhibitors, which allows us to use high-throughput screening
technologies, informatics and medicinal chemistry to rapidly identify drug-like
classes of compounds in parallel for multiple targets. Along with this
approach, we use a variety of biological and chemical methodologies that
interrogate the function of newly discovered proteins in order to focus our
drug discovery and development efforts on the most promising targets within the
most promising gene families. We believe that our systematic application of
this drug discovery approach is increasing the speed and efficiency of drug
design efforts directed at novel biological targets, and is securing valuable
intellectual property for us in gene families of interest.

Technology Platform

We
employ a variety of technologies and use information from a number of different
scientific disciplines as part of our integrated technology platform. The most
significant of them are as follows.

·

Functional Genomics.

We use functional genomics
techniques, such as gene knock-out mice, to help guide target selection and
test the potential of chemical compounds in disease models. We also use
antisense, siRNA, dominant negative cell lines, transcriptional profiling, proteomics
and other biological approaches to better characterize the role played by
specific targets in cellular processes.

·

Biophysics.

We generate atomic structural information
on molecular targets using X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic
resonance, or NMR, spectroscopy to guide design and optimization of lead
classes of drugs.

·

Computer-based Modeling.

We apply advanced
proprietary computational modeling tools to guide the evaluation and selection
of compounds for synthesis. During our virtual screening process, which we
refer to as

in silico screening

, candidate compounds
are selected for synthesis and further investigation. We use proprietary
algorithms to sort and filter compounds for specific properties in order to
seek compounds that are more likely to become development candidates.

·

Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacology.

We employ a number
of approaches to obtain predictive information on the bioavailability,
pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy of potential drug candidates. These
approaches include

in vitro

metabolism and toxicological studies and

in vivo

assessment of leads in hypothetically predictive animal models.

·

Assay Development.

We use modern cell biology,
enzymology, and screening techniques to develop high-throughput assays which
provide high-quality information to support drug discovery. We also are
utilizing our assay capabilities to develop novel proprietary

in vitro

assays to rapidly establish ADME/toxicology
profiles for compounds in our screening library.

·

High-Throughput Screening.

We conduct assays for most
enzyme and receptor targets using very high-throughput screening approaches,
many of which are proprietary. These assays enable us to rapidly generate large
numbers of lead compounds and drug candidates across targets from many
different gene families. These approaches integrate compound management, plate
replication with miniaturized screening, hit (potential lead) identification
and follow-up.

·

Material Sciences.

By applying advanced principles of physical chemistry and
materials science at the interface between preclinical drug discovery and
pharmaceutical product development, we are attempting to ensure that the drugs
in our pipeline have excellent Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls
properties, or CMC properties. CMC refers to the FDA requirement that all drugs
be manufactured, stored and administered in a controlled fashion. Our materials
scientists study the atomic level structures of drug candidates, as well as
their physical and chemical properties. 
Utilizing this knowledge together with molecular engineering design
principles, the properties of a drug candidate are adjusted to improve the
resultant active pharmaceutical ingredient’s profile.  Advances in materials science have been
applied with great success to the consumer products industries, the electronics
industry and the medical device industry in products such as plasma
televisions, computer chips and artificial bone replacements.  Leveraging advanced materials science
technologies in the pharmaceutical industry to the selection and development of
drug


candidates offers the potential for a higher rate of success in
clinical development, decreased time to market, and enhanced product
performance.

·

Instrumentation.

We
have a dedicated research and application development group, which is
responsible for designing and building automated solutions to address many of
the more repetitive and labor-intensive aspects and processes of drug
discovery. For example, most of our ion channel research is conducted using
E-VIPR, our proprietary screening technology that uses fluorescent probes and
waves of electrical stimulation to study ion channels. E-VIPR provides an
automated, high-throughput platform that enables us to collect high quality
data at speeds up to a thousand times faster than patch clamping.

Current Research
Programs

Our past drug discovery
efforts have produced a variety of drug candidates that are currently in
preclinical or clinical development. We believe our ongoing research programs
continue to create potential value for us by generating new drug candidates in
areas of significant unmet medical need. These programs include research
targeting certain kinases, ion channels, g-protein coupled receptors and
HCV protease inhibitors.

Kinase Program

We have a broad-based
drug discovery effort targeting the human protein and lipid kinase family, of
which there are more than 500 members. These kinases are enzymes that play a
key role in transmitting signals between and within cells. Kinases exert their
effect by phosphorylating other proteins, which then become activated and
perform a specific function. Kinase activity has been implicated in many major
diseases, including cancer and autoimmune, inflammatory, cardiovascular,
metabolic, and neurological diseases. As a result, we believe that kinases are
ideal targets for therapeutic intervention. The clinical success of the
oncology drugs Gleevec

®

(imatinib mesylate) and Tarceva

®

(erlotinib) offer examples of how small
molecule kinase inhibitors can be tailored to address specific diseases. Our
extensive drug discovery efforts involving numerous targets in the kinase gene
family continue to refine our understanding of kinase biology and the design of
kinase inhibitors. Our researchers have determined the atomic structure of more
than 25 kinase drug targets and hundreds of kinase/inhibitor co-complexes. This
information is of critical importance in the design of selective inhibitors for
ongoing research projects. We also have designed a diverse library of
proprietary kinase inhibitors and we continue to expand that library. We apply
all of these tools with the objective of determining and optimizing new
chemical scaffolds against targets of interest in the area of kinase
inhibition.

From 2000 through 2006, we
received funding and support for our research efforts within the kinase target
family under our collaboration with Novartis. In accordance with the terms of
the collaboration agreement, we retain the rights to all the drug candidates
and intellectual property developed under that collaboration.

In 2004, we entered into a
collaboration with Merck for the development of MK-0457 (VX-680), an
Aurora kinase inhibitor, in cancer, and for continuing collaborative research through
mid-2006 in the area of Aurora kinase inhibition. Under this collaboration
agreement, Merck is currently conducting Phase 2 clinical trials of MK-0457
(VX-680) and a Phase 1 clinical trial of MK-6592 (VX-667).

We are continuing investigation
of several other kinase inhibitors that play a role in the development and
progression of cancer, inflammation and autoimmune disease

, infectious diseases and neurodegenerative
diseases. The most advanced of these inhibitors are selective JAK3 inhibitors,
which we believe have the potential to be used in treatments for
transplantation, psoriasis and RA

.

Membrane Target Programs (Ion Channels and GPCRs)

We are conducting a broad-based
drug discovery program targeting the ion channel family. Ion channels are a
gene family of more than 650 proteins that act as cellular gatekeepers,
controlling the flow of ions across cell membranes. The ion channel family
contains numerous drugable targets representing


potential
therapeutic intervention points for a variety of indications, including cystic
fibrosis, pain and inflammatory, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
Existing therapies such as amlodipine and nifedipine, which are calcium channel
blockers for the treatment of hypertension, and lamotrigine and carbamazepine,
which are sodium channel inhibitors for the treatment of epilepsy, provide a
strong rationale for developing drugs targeting ion channels.

Our ion channel research
extends across several ion channel subfamilies, including sodium channels,
potassium channels, calcium channels, and chloride channels and is principally
focused at present on the design and development of small-molecule drugs
for the treatment of pain and cystic fibrosis. For example, specific sodium
channels have been shown to increase in expression and function in peripheral
nerve cells at the site of injury, making them novel and attractive targets for
the treatment of neuropathic pain. We are utilizing our expertise in assay
development and screening to advance discovery efforts within the ion channel
family.

We have an ongoing
research collaboration with CFFT targeting the CFTR protein. Improper
functioning of CFTR may cause the accumulation of water and salt, including
chloride ions, that is believed to be the cause of mucous accumulation in the
lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.

This collaboration with CFFT has
produced VX-770, a potentiator of CFTR function that is intended to increase
the flux of chloride ions through CFTR. VX-770 is currently in clinical testing.

Our continuing research efforts in this collaboration are focused on the
identification of possible CFTR corrector compounds that may work to increase
the number of ion channels in certain lung cell membranes of patients with CF as
well as potentiator back up compounds that will increase the flux of chloride
ions through CFTR.

G-protein coupled
receptors, or GPCRs, represent an additional gene family comprising over 1000
distinct proteins that transduce extracellular signals to the inside of the
cell and regulate a diversity of functions in both normal and pathological
conditions. A study has estimated that approximately 25% of FDA-approved drugs
target GPCRs. Our program is aimed at several type 1 and type 2 GPCR targets in
the areas of pain and nervous system disorders.

Additional Discovery Efforts

We plan to utilize our
proprietary gene family-based platform and experience in structure-based
drug design to pursue targets in other medically important gene families, such
as proteases. Among other things, we have significant efforts underway
targeting follow up HCV protease inhibitors to strengthen our HCV research and
development franchise.

CORPORATE
COLLABORATIONS

We have entered into
corporate collaborations with pharmaceutical and other companies and
organizations that provide financial and other resources, including
capabilities in research, development, manufacturing, and sales and marketing,
to support our research and development programs. At present, we have the
following major corporate collaborations.

Janssen Pharmaceutica, N.V.

On June 30, 2006, we entered into a license, development,
manufacturing and commercialization agreement with Janssen. Under the
collaboration agreement, we will collaborate with Janssen to develop and
commercialize telaprevir.

Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we
will retain exclusive commercial rights to telaprevir in North America and will
continue to lead the development plan for telaprevir in North America and the
Janssen territories. Janssen received exclusive rights to commercialize
telaprevir outside of North America and the Far East. In connection with the
execution of the collaboration agreement, we received an up-front payment of
$165 million in July 2006. In addition, we could receive additional contingent
milestone payments, which could total up to $380 million if telaprevir is
successfully developed, approved and launched. Janssen has agreed to be
responsible for 50% of drug development costs under


the development program for
North America and the Janssen territories. Each of the parties to the
collaboration agreement will be responsible for drug supply in their respective
territories. The collaboration agreement also includes a tiered royalty
averaging a mid-20% range, as a percentage of net sales in the Janssen territories,
depending upon successful commercialization. In addition, Janssen will be
responsible for certain third party royalties in its territories. Janssen may
terminate the collaboration agreement upon six months’ notice to us. In such an
event, all manufacturing, commercialization and intellectual property rights to
telaprevir under the collaboration agreement will revert to us.

As part of the
collaboration agreement, following regulatory approval and commercialization of
telaprevir in both North America and Janssen’s territory, we will establish
with Tibotec, also a Johnson & Johnson company, a global health
initiative to increase the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of HCV
infection, to be principally directed toward developing countries.

GlaxoSmithKline plc

In 1993, we entered into a collaboration with
GlaxoSmithKline covering the research, development and commercialization of HIV
protease inhibitors, including Agenerase (amprenavir), Lexiva/Telzir
(fosamprenavir calcium) and brecanavir (VX-385). Under the original agreement,
GlaxoSmithKline had exclusive rights to develop and commercialize our HIV PIs
in all parts of the world except the Far East. In 2003, we amended the
agreement to add the Far East to GlaxoSmithKline’s territory for development
and commercialization of Lexiva/Telzir. GlaxoSmithKline pays us a royalty on
all sales of the HIV PIs covered by the agreement. We have retained certain
bulk drug manufacturing rights and certain co-promotion rights in the
territories licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. We began earning a royalty from
GlaxoSmithKline in 1999 on sales of Agenerase, in the fourth quarter of 2003 on
sales of Lexiva, and in the third quarter of 2004 on sales of Telzir. Lexiva
and Tezir have replaced Agenerase in worldwide markets.

GlaxoSmithKline initiated development of a third HIV
PI discovered under the collaboration known as brecanavir (VX-385). GlaxoSmithKline
bore all development costs for brecanavir, and paid us $1.0 million in
development stage milestones. On December 15, 2006,

GlaxoSmithKline formally notified us that it

would
discontinue clinical development of brecanavir, which had advanced to
Phase 2 clinical trials.

Currently,
there are no drug candidates being developed under this collaboration, and we
do not anticipate any additional milestone payments under this collaboration.

GlaxoSmithKline has the
right to terminate its agreement with us without cause upon 12 months’
notice. Termination of the agreement by GlaxoSmithKline will relieve it of its
obligation to make further commercialization and development milestone and
royalty payments, and will end any license granted by us to GlaxoSmithKline
under the agreement. In June 1996, we and GlaxoSmithKline obtained a
worldwide, non-exclusive license under certain G.D. Searle & Co. (now
owned by Pharmacia/Pfizer) patents in the area of HIV protease inhibition. We
pay Searle a royalty based on sales of Lexiva/Telzir.

In December 2005, we
entered into a separate collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline for
the development and commercialization of VX-409 and certain back-up
compounds. Under the terms of the agreement, GlaxoSmithKline has the exclusive
right and license to develop and commercialize VX-409 and the back-up
compounds worldwide. The agreement provides for a $20 million up-front
license payment, which was paid in December 2005, and potentially
additional development and commercial milestone payments assuming the
development of VX-409 and back-up compounds in major pharmaceutical
markets across a range of indications. GlaxoSmithKline will also pay us
royalties on annual net sales of any pharmaceutical products commercialized
under the agreement. Prior to commercial launch of any drug that is covered by
the agreement, GlaxoSmithKline can terminate the agreement without cause upon
six months’ notice to us. Following commercial launch, GlaxoSmithKline can
terminate the agreement on one year’s notice, unless the termination is the
result of a safety issue associated with a drug arising from the collaboration,
in which case GlaxoSmithKline may terminate immediately upon notice.


Merck &
Co., Inc.

In June 2004, we
entered into a global collaboration with Merck to develop and commercialize MK-0457
(VX-680), our lead Aurora kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of cancer,
and to conduct research targeting the discovery of an additional Aurora kinase
inhibitory compound or compounds to follow MK-0457 (VX-680). Merck made
an up-front license payment of $20 million in June 2004, and provided
research funding of $15.8 million between June 2004 and September 2006.
In addition, the agreement provides for as much as $350 million in
milestone payments, including up to $130 million for the successful
development of MK-0457 (VX-680) in the first oncology indication and
additional milestone payments for development of MK-0457 (VX-680) and
follow-on compounds in subsequent major oncology indications. In 2005, Merck
selected MK-6592 (VX-667), a second drug candidate covered by the
collaboration, for development. Under the agreement, Merck made two milestone
payments totaling $19.5 million in 2005 and three milestone payments
totaling $36.3 million in 2006. Under the agreement, Merck is responsible for
worldwide clinical development and commercialization of MK-0457 (VX-680)
and follow-on candidates (including MK-6592 (VX-667)) and will pay
us royalties on any product sales. Merck may terminate the agreement at any
time without cause upon 90 days’ advance written notice, except that six
months’ advance written notice is required for termination at any time when a
product has marketing approval in a major market and the termination is not the
result of a safety issue.

Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated

In May 2004, we
entered into a collaboration agreement with CFFT providing funding for our
late-stage cystic fibrosis drug discovery effort. The agreement subsequently
was amended to extend the term of the drug discovery effort to March 31,
2008 and to include additional development stage funding for specified VX-770
development activities through the end of 2007. The agreement, as amended,
provides that CFFT will pay up to $32.4 million to us for research and
development activities. Under the amended agreement, we retain the right to
develop and commercialize any compounds discovered in the course of the
research collaboration, and we will pay a royalty to CFFT on the net sales of
any drugs discovered in the collaboration. CFFT provided $21.3 million in
research support payments related to the agreement in aggregate in 2004
and 2005, and the amended agreement provides for additional funding from CFFT
for further research during the period from January 1, 2006 through March 31,
2008 directed toward CFTR corrector compounds. CFFT also made a
$1.5 million milestone payment to us upon advancement of the first
compound from the research program into clinical development. CFFT has the right
to terminate the agreement without cause, effective on June 30, 2007, upon
60 days’ prior written notice.

Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation

In June 2004, we
entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with
Mitsubishi for the development and commercialization of telaprevir, in Japan
and certain other Far East countries. Under the terms of the agreement,
Mitsubishi has the right to develop and commercialize telaprevir in its
territory. Under the agreement, we are entitled to receive up to
$33 million in payments from Mitsubishi through Phase 2 clinical
development, including an up-front license fee, development milestone payments
and contributions to certain drug development costs incurred by us for telaprevir.
Further cost sharing beyond Phase 2 clinical development will be determined by
Mitsubishi and us based on the design of registration trials for telaprevir. We
will also be entitled to royalties on sales of telaprevir, if approved, in Mitsubishi’s
territory. Mitsubishi may terminate the agreement at any time without cause
upon 60 days’ prior written notice. In 2006, Mitsubishi conducted a Phase
1 clinical trial of telaprevir in the Far East. Mitsubishi is designing a Phase
2 clinical program of telaprevir in the Far East.


Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

In September 1997, we
entered into a collaboration agreement with Kissei to identify and develop
compounds that target p38 MAP kinase. The research phase of the collaboration
ended on June 30, 2000, and we have received the full amount of research
funding specified under the agreement. We are working with Kissei to develop
and commercialize VX-702, which was discovered during our p38 MAP kinase
research collaboration. Kissei has exclusive rights to develop and
commercialize VX-702 in Japan and certain Far East countries, and
co-exclusive rights (with us) in China, Taiwan and South Korea. We retain
exclusive marketing rights outside the Far East. Under our agreement, Kissei
will pay us development milestone payments for the successful development
of VX-702 in the Far East, including $2.5 million paid
in 2005 upon Kissei’s submission of regulatory filings in preparation for
Phase 1 clinical trials of VX-702 in Japan. Kissei is providing a portion
of the funding for our clinical trials of VX-702 in patients with RA. If
VX-702 is approved for sale in Kissei’s territory, we will have the option
to supply Kissei with bulk drug substance for manufacture by Kissei into drug
product. We will receive drug supply payments or royalties on any product
sales.

Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

In February 2005, we
entered into a license agreement with Avalon for the development and
commercialization of the IMPDH inhibitor AVN-944 (VX-944) for the
treatment of cancer. Under the agreement, Avalon has the exclusive worldwide
right and responsibility to develop and commercialize AVN-944 (VX-944)
for the treatment of cancer. Avalon made a $5.0 million up-front
license payment to us and has agreed to make additional milestone payments to
us for the successful development of AVN-944 (VX-944) in multiple
oncology indications. Avalon will pay us royalties on any product sales. The
agreement provides us with certain rights to co-promote AVN-944 (VX-944).
Neither party has the right to terminate the agreement other than for cause.

INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY

We actively seek protection for our products and
proprietary information by means of United States and foreign patents,
trademarks, and copyrights, as appropriate. In addition, we rely upon trade
secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our
proprietary information and products. In addition to patents and pending patent
applications that relate to potential drug targets, compounds we are developing
to modulate those targets, and methods of making or using those compounds, we
have several patents and pending patent applications directed to proprietary
elements of our drug discovery platform. For example, some of these “platform”
patents and applications claim our proprietary E-VIPR ion channel screening
technology.

Much of our technology and
many of our processes depend upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key
scientific and technical personnel. To protect our rights to our proprietary
know-how and technology, we require all employees, as well as our consultants
and advisors when feasible, to enter into confidentiality agreements that
require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and
inventions made by these employees, consultants and advisors in the course of
their service to us.

Patents and Pending
Patent Applications

We hold issued
patents and pending patent applications in the United States, and in foreign
countries we deem appropriate, covering intellectual property developed as part
of each of our advanced research, development and commercial programs. Our
intellectual property holdings include but are not limited to:

·

From time to time we enter
into non-exclusive license agreements for proprietary third-party
technology used in connection with our research activities. These license
agreements typically provide for the payment by us of a license fee, but may
also include terms providing for milestone payments or royalties for the
development and/or commercialization of our drug products arising from the
related research. For example, we have entered into a non-exclusive
license arrangement with Chiron Corporation for rights to technology in the
HCV area that may provide Chiron with certain developmental milestone
payments and royalty payments based on future sales of telaprevir if approved.

MANUFACTURING

As we advance our proprietary drug candidates through
clinical development toward commercialization, we will be required to continue
to build our manufacturing, logistics, supply chain and quality assurance
resources. We currently rely on a worldwide network of third-party
manufacturers to manufacture and distribute our drug candidates for clinical
trials, and we expect that we will continue to do so to meet our commercial
supply needs for those drugs, if they are approved for sale. Commercial
manufacturing of Lexiva/Telzir is being done by GlaxoSmithKline.


We have retained manufacturing and commercialization
responsibilities for telaprevir in North America. In 2007, we expect to undertake
significant efforts to prepare for the commercial supply and marketing of
telaprevir, in support of a timely and effective commercial product launch in
subsequent years if we are successful in obtaining regulatory marketing
approval.

Establishing the commercial supply
chain for telaprevir is a multi-step international endeavor involving the
purchase of several raw materials, the application of certain manufacturing
processes requiring significant lead times, the conversion of active
pharmaceutical ingredient to tablet form and the packaging of tablets for
distribution. We expect to source raw materials, drug substance and drug
product, including finished packaging, from third parties located in the Far
East, the European Union and the United States, and we are currently
establishing and expanding third-party relationships in this regard.
Establishing and providing quality assurance for this global supply chain requires
a significant financial commitment, experienced personnel and the creation or
expansion of numerous third-party contractual relationships. Because of the
significant lead times involved in our supply chain for telaprevir, we may have
less flexibility to adjust our supply in response to changes in demand than if
we had shorter lead times.

We have successfully completed the technical
development work for the Phase 3 and commercial formulation of telaprevir.
While we believe that there are multiple third parties that are capable of
providing the materials and services we need in order to manufacture and
distribute telaprevir, if it is approved for sale, some of these services are
in high demand and capacity is constrained. As a result there can be no
assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain these relationships on
commercially reasonable terms.

We believe that entering into arrangements with
multiple third-party manufacturers will reduce our risk of supply chain
disruption by limiting our reliance on any one manufacturer. In addition, we
are in the process of transferring technical information regarding the
manufacture of telaprevir to Janssen so that Janssen will be able to
manufacture telaprevir, if approved, for sale in Janssen’s territories and as a
secondary supply source for us. There is no assurance, however, that we will be
able to establish second sources for each stage of manufacturing of telaprevir
or that any second source will be able to produce sufficient quantities of a
particular material in the required timeframe to avoid a supply chain disruption
if there is a problem with one of our suppliers.

We are focusing resources on the development of
systems and processes to track, monitor and oversee our third-party
manufacturers’ activities. We evaluate the performance of our third-party manufacturers
and confirm their continuing capabilities to meet our needs efficiently and
economically. Third-party manufacturing facilities, both foreign and domestic,
are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by or under
the authority of other federal, state, local or foreign authorities. Any
failure by any of our third-party manufacturers to pass any inspection could
adversely affect our ability to launch telaprevir in a timely manner, if it is
approved for sale, or adversely affect our ability to continue to distribute
telaprevir after launch.

We have established a quality assurance program
intended to ensure that our third-party manufacturers and service
providers produce materials and provide services, when applicable, in accordance
with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and other
applicable regulations. We will need to increase our quality assurance
resources in connection with the commercial launch of any drug product.

The production of our drug
candidates is based in part on technology that we believe to be proprietary.
Where applicable, we license this technology to our third-party manufacturers
to enable them to manufacture the various forms of our drug candidates for us.
However, in the course of their services, a third-party manufacturer may
develop process technology related to the manufacture of our drug candidates
that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us. This might
increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license
from that manufacturer if we wish to have our drug candidates manufactured by
other suppliers utilizing the same process.


COMPETITION

We are engaged in fields characterized by extensive
research efforts, rapid technological progress and intense competition. There
are many public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies,
chemical companies and biotechnology companies, engaged in developing products
for the same human therapeutic applications as those we are targeting. Many of
our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human
resources than we do and are more experienced in the development of new drugs
than we are. In order for us to compete successfully, we may need to
demonstrate improved safety, efficacy, ease of manufacturing and market
acceptance of our products over the products of our competitors that have received
or will receive regulatory approval for marketing.

We face competition based
on the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, the timing and scope of
regulatory approvals, the availability and cost of supply, marketing and sales
capabilities, reimbursement coverage, price, patent position and other factors.
Our competitors may develop or commercialize more effective, safer or more
affordable products than we are able to develop or commercialize or obtain more
effective patent protection. As a result, our competitors may commercialize
products more rapidly or effectively than we do, which would adversely affect
our competitive position, the likelihood that our drug candidates, if approved,
will achieve initial market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful
revenues from those drugs. Even if our drug candidates are approved and achieve
initial market acceptance, competitive products may render our drugs obsolete
or noncompetitive. If any such drug is rendered obsolete, we may not be able to
recover the expenses of developing and commercializing that drug. With respect
to all of our drugs and drug candidates, we are aware of existing treatments
and numerous drug candidates in development by our competitors.

HCV Infection

We are aware of numerous companies that are attempting
to develop new treatments for HCV infection, including Schering-Plough
Corporation, InterMune, Inc. in collaboration with Roche, and Gilead
Sciences in collaboration with Achillion Pharmaceuticals, which are developing
HCV protease inhibitors:

·

Schering-Plough
is developing SCH 503034, an orally available HCV protease inhibitor.  SCH 503034 received “Fast Track”
designation from the FDA in January 2006. Schering-Plough has reported
that it is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial with approximately 350 patients.
In 2005, Schering-Plough commenced this clinical trial of SCH 503034 in
combination with peg-IFN, with and without RBV, for 24 or 48 weeks in patients
with chronic HCV genotype 1 who were nonresponders to previous peg-IFN and RBV
combination therapy. In addition, in January 2007 Schering-Plough
disclosed the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of SCH 503034 in
combination with peg-IFN and RBV in which it expects to enroll approximately 400
treatment-naïve patients.

·

InterMune
in collaboration with Roche is developing ITMN-191, a HCV protease
inhibitor. In December 2006, InterMune announced the initiation of a Phase 1a
clinical trial of ITMN-191 in healthy volunteers.

·

Gilead
Sciences and Achillion Pharmaceuticals are collaborating on the development of
HCV protease inhibitors. In February 2007, Gilead and Achillion announced
the discontinuation of the development of GS 9132 (ACH-806), which had been
their lead HCV protease inhibitor drug candidate, based on preliminary data
from a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial. In February 2007 they also announced
they were evaluating additional compounds that they were investigating for the
treatment of HCV infection.


In addition to the
protease inhibitor drug candidates, companies are developing polymerase
inhibitors, a drug discovery target distinct from protease inhibitors, for the
treatment of HCV. The HCV polymerase is responsible for synthesizing viral RNA
during HCV replication. Companies that are in Phase 2 clinical development with
polymerase inhibitors include:

·

Idenix
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Novartis is developing
valopicitabine, an orally available inhibitor of HCV RNA polymerase. Idenix has
two ongoing Phase 2b clinical trials, which were initiated in 2005, evaluating
the combination of valopicitabine and peg-IFN in patients infected with HCV who
previously failed to respond to antiviral treatment and treatment-naïve
patients. In addition, in October 2006, Idenix announced that it had
recently initiated an additional 12-week 90-patient Phase 2 clinical
trial of valopicitabine, referred to as a drug/drug interaction trial, to
assess valopicitabine when administered in combination with peg-IFN and RBV.

·

ViroPharma
Incorporated in collaboration with Wyeth is developing HCV-796, a
non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, which is in Phase 2 clinical trials.

·

Roche
is developing R1626, a polymerase inhibitor, which is in Phase 2 clinical
trials.

We are aware of numerous other compounds targeting HCV
that are in clinical trials, and we believe that there are many additional
potential HCV treatments in research or early development.

We believe that there is a
potential for new oral drug candidates, if approved, to be administered
together with or without peg-IFN and RBV. We expect that in the future we may
explore the potential for other combination therapies and in particular a
combination where all the necessary drugs could be administered orally.

RA

There are currently several biological tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-

a

) inhibitors approved by the FDA
for the treatment of RA including Enbrel

®

(etanercept), Humira

®

(adalimumab), and Remicade

®

(infliximab). Additionally, Orencia

®

(abatacept), an inhibitor of T-cell
activation, and Rituxan

®

(rituximab), a monoclonal antibody, are now
marketed for the treatment of RA.

There is a wide range of
drug candidates in numerous classes being investigated for the treatment of RA.
Examples include the IL-6 monoclonal antibody Actemra

®

(tocilizumab) (Roche/Chugai), and the TNF-

a

inhibitor certolizumab (UCB).
There are also a number of p38 MAP kinase inhibitors under investigation for
the potential treatment of RA. In addition to Vertex, other companies with open
or planned Phase 2 p38 MAP programs in RA include GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, and
Roche.

CF

Several companies are
engaged in the process of developing treatments for CF. For example, PTC
Therapeutics, Inc. recently has an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials for
PTC124, a drug candidate that targets nonsense genetic mutations that can cause
cystic fibrosis in some populations. Altus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is
developing ALTU-135, an orally-delivered enzyme replacement therapy for the
treatment of pancreatic insufficiency, a condition that affects many CF
patients. Inspire Pharmaceuticals Inc. currently is conducting Phase 3
clinical trials of denufosol tetrasodium, an inhaled molecule that activates an

HIV

The United States market for HIV PIs is highly
competitive, with a number of competitive PIs currently on the market. The two
leading HIV PIs in the United States are Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s Reyataz

®

and Abbott Laboratories’ Kaletra

®

. In 2006, Lexiva was the third largest
(measured in terms of sales revenue) HIV PI inhibitor in the United States,
excluding ritonavir, and it currently holds


an approximate 11% share
of the United States HIV PI market based on total prescriptions (also excluding
ritonavir).

In the field of HIV
protease inhibition, Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead
Sciences, Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc., among
others, have other HIV PIs drug candidates in various stages of development. In
addition to the currently marketed protease inhibitors, each of these compounds
and others that may be in research or development may eventually compete with
Lexiva/Telzir.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Our development, manufacture
and potential sale of therapeutics are subject to extensive regulation by
United States and foreign governmental authorities. In particular,
pharmaceutical products are subject to rigorous preclinical, nonclinical and
clinical testing and to other approval requirements by the FDA in the United
States under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and by comparable agencies in
most foreign countries. In addition to prohibiting the sale and distribution of
pharmaceutical products prior to regulatory approval, the FDA and comparable
agencies in most foreign countries prohibit the pre-approval promotion of
investigational drugs as being safe and effective for the indication for which
it is under investigation. Although we have summarized the FDA process below,
other countries may have different approval processes with which we will need
to comply if we seek to conduct clinical trials or obtain marketing approval in
those countries. In addition, even if we ultimately intend to seek initial
marketing approval in the United States, we may conduct early clinical trials
in other countries, for a variety of reasons, and therefore the submission of our
initial IND in the United States may not occur until after one or more foreign-sited
clinical trials have been initiated.

Approval Process

As an initial step in the FDA regulatory approval
process, toxicity studies in animals and other studies typically are conducted to
help identify potential safety problems that might be associated with
administration of the drug candidate being tested over the period of time
planned for the initial human trials. For certain diseases, animal models exist
that are believed to be predictive of efficacy in humans. For such diseases, a
drug candidate typically is tested for efficacy in that animal model. The
results of these nonclinical safety and disease model studies are submitted to
the FDA as a part of the IND submission, which is submitted prior to
commencement of human clinical testing in the United States. For several of our
drug candidates, no appropriately predictive animal model exists. As a result,
no

in vivo

evidence of efficacy
will be available until those drug candidates progress to human clinical
trials. A variety of nonclinical studies in a number of animal species, and
other nonclinical studies, ordinarily are conducted while human clinical trials
are underway, to provide supplemental toxicology and other information. This
information as well as the results from the early clinical trials will provide
a foundation for the design of broader and more lengthy human clinical trials.

Clinical trials typically are conducted in three
sequential phases, although the phases may overlap. Phase 1 frequently begins
with the initial introduction of the drug candidate into healthy human subjects
prior to introduction into patients. The drug candidate may then be tested in a
relatively small number of patients for safety on a preliminary basis, dosage
tolerance, absorption, bioavailability, biodistribution, metabolism, excretion,
clinical pharmacology and, if possible, for early information on effectiveness.
Phase 2 typically involves trials in a small sample of the intended
patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug for a specific
indication, to determine dose tolerance and the optimal dose range and to
gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
Phase 3 trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical safety and efficacy
in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed trial sites, to
determine the overall risk-benefit ratio of the drug candidate and to provide
an adequate basis for proposed physician labeling. Each trial is conducted in
accordance with standards set forth in protocols that detail the objectives of
the trial, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy
criteria to be evaluated. For clinical trials in the United States, each
protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND submission. Further,
each clinical trial must be evaluated by an independent


Institutional Review
Board, or IRB, at each institution at which the trial will be conducted. The
IRBs will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human
subjects and the possible liability of the institution.

Data from nonclinical testing and clinical trials are
submitted to the FDA in a New Drug Application, or NDA, for United States
marketing approval. The process of completing nonclinical and clinical testing
and obtaining FDA approval for a new drug is likely to take a number of years
and require the expenditure of substantial resources. Preparing an NDA involves
considerable data collection, verification, analysis and expense, and there can
be no assurance that approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The
approval process is affected by a number of factors, including the severity of
the targeted disease, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks
and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA may deny an NDA if applicable
regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional testing or
information. Among the conditions for marketing approval is the requirement
that the prospective manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing
procedures conform to the FDA’s cGMP regulations, which must be followed at all
times. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations,
manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of
production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance.
Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, also are subject to
inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by or under the authority
of other federal, state, local agencies or foreign authorities.

Under the FDA Modernization
Act of 1997, the FDA may grant “Fast Track” designation to facilitate the
development of a drug intended for the treatment of a serious or
life-threatening condition if the drug demonstrates, among other things, the
potential to address an unmet medical need. The benefits of Fast Track
designation include scheduled meetings with the FDA to receive input on
development plans, the option of submitting an NDA in sections (rather than
submitting all components simultaneously), and the option of requesting evaluation
of trials using surrogate endpoints. Fast Track designation does not
necessarily lead to a priority review or accelerated approval of a drug
candidate by the FDA. Telaprevir and VX-770 have received Fast Track
designation by the FDA.

Timing to Approval

We
estimate that it generally takes 10 to 15 years, or possibly longer, to
discover, develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the
United States as outlined below:

Phase:

Objective:

Estimated Duration:

Discovery

Lead identification
  and target validation

2 to
  4 years

Preclinical

Initial toxicology for preliminary identification of
  risks for humans; gather early pharmacokinetic data

1 to
  2 years

Phase 1

Evaluate safety in humans; study how the drug
  candidate works, metabolizes and interacts with other drugs

1 to
  2 years

Phase 2

Establish effectiveness of the drug candidate and
  its optimal dosage; continue safety evaluation

2 to
  4 years

Phase 3

Confirm efficacy, dosage regime and safety profile
  of the drug candidate; submit NDA

2 to
  4 years

FDA approval

Approval by the
  FDA to sell and market the drug for the approved indication

6 months to 2 years

A drug candidate may fail
at any point during this process. Animal and other nonclinical studies
typically are conducted during each phase of human clinical trials.

Post-approval Studies

Even after FDA approval
has been obtained, further studies, including post-approval trials, may be
required to provide additional data on safety and will be required to gain
approval for the sale of a product as a treatment for clinical indications
other than those for which the product initially was approved. Also,


the FDA
will require post-approval reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug.
Results of post-approval programs may limit or expand the indications for which
the drug product may be marketed. Further, if there are any requests for
modifications to the initial FDA approval for the drug, including changes in
indication, manufacturing process, labeling or manufacturing facilities, a
supplemental NDA may be required to be submitted to the FDA or we may elect to
seek changes and submit a supplemental NDA to obtain approval.

Other Regulations

Pursuant to the Drug Price
Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, under certain conditions a
sponsor may be granted marketing exclusivity for a period of five years
following FDA approval. During this period, third parties would not be
permitted to obtain FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an
Abbreviated NDA, which is the application form typically used by manufacturers
seeking approval of a generic drug. The statute also allows a patent owner to
extend the term of the patent for a period equal to one-half the period of time
elapsed between the submission of an IND and the filing of the corresponding
NDA plus the period of time between the filing of the NDA and FDA approval. We
intend to seek the benefits of this statute, but there can be no assurance that
we will be able to obtain any such benefits.

Whether
or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a drug product by regulatory
authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of
commercial sales of the product in such countries. Historically, the
requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product approvals,
and the time required for approval, have varied widely from country to country.

The FDA may grant orphan
drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition” that
affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug
designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing
authorization. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or
shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a
product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA
approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is
entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other
application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of
seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical
superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Also, competitors may
receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which
the orphan product has exclusivity.

Pharmaceutical companies
also are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care
“fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws.
Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for any entity or person to solicit, offer,
receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of
business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. False
claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing
to be presented, for payment to third party payors, including Medicare and
Medicaid, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent,
claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically
unnecessary items or services.

In addition to the
statutes and regulations described above, we are also subject to regulation
under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act,
the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
and other federal, state, local and foreign regulations, now or hereafter in
effect.

RISK FACTORS

Risk Factors

Investing
in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully
consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other
information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form
10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial
condition or results of operations would likely suffer, possibly materially. In
that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall.

WE EXPECT TO INCUR FUTURE LOSSES, AND WE MAY NEVER
BECOME PROFITABLE.

We have incurred
significant operating losses each year since our inception, including net
losses of $206.9 million, $203.4 million and $166.2 million during 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively, and expect to incur a significant operating loss
in 2007. We believe that operating losses will continue beyond 2007, even if we
receive significant future payments under our existing and future collaborative
agreements, because we are planning to make significant investments in research
and development, and because we will incur significant selling, general and
administrative expenses in the course of researching, developing and
commercializing our drug candidates. These net losses have had and will
continue to have an adverse effect on, among other things, our stockholders’
equity, total assets and working capital. We expect that losses will fluctuate
from quarter to quarter and year to year, and that such fluctuations may be
substantial. We cannot predict when we will become profitable, if at all.

WE
DEPEND HEAVILY ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR LEAD DRUG CANDIDATE, TELAPREVIR, WHICH IS
STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE TELAPREVIR, OR
EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN DOING SO, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE MATERIALLY
HARMED.

We are
investing a significant portion of our time, personnel and financial resources
in the development of telaprevir, which is currently in Phase 2b clinical
trials. The clinical development and commercial success of telaprevir will
depend on several factors, including the following:

·

successful completion and favorable outcome of
clinical trials;

·

ongoing discussions with the FDA and
comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope and design of our clinical
trials;

·

receipt and timing of marketing approvals for
telaprevir from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;

·

establishing and maintaining commercial
manufacturing arrangements for telaprevir with third-party manufacturers;

·

launching commercial sales of telaprevir by us
and our collaborators; and

·

acceptance of telaprevir, if approved, in the
medical community and with third-party payors.

If the data from our
ongoing clinical trials or non-clinical studies regarding the safety or
efficacy of telaprevir are not favorable, we may be forced to delay or
terminate the clinical development of telaprevir, which would materially harm
our business. Further, even if we gain marketing approvals from the FDA and
similar foreign regulatory authorities in a timely manner, we cannot be sure
that telaprevir will be accepted by purchasers in the pharmaceutical market. If
the results of clinical trials of telaprevir, the anticipated or actual timing
of marketing approvals for telaprevir, or the market acceptance of telaprevir,
if approved, do not meet the expectations of investors or public market
analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline.


MANY
OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ARE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, AND ALL OF
OUR DRUG CANDIDATES REMAIN SUBJECT TO CLINICAL TESTING AND REGULATORY APPROVAL.
IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND TEST OUR DRUG CANDIDATES, WE WILL
NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

The
success of our business depends primarily upon our ability, and our
collaborators’ ability, to develop and commercialize our drug candidates,
including telaprevir, successfully. Our drug candidates are in various stages
of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy
before they can be approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for
sale. To satisfy these standards, we and/or our collaborators must engage in
expensive and lengthy testing of our drug candidates. Despite our efforts, our
drug candidates may not:

·

offer therapeutic or other improvement over
existing competitive drugs;

·

be proven safe and effective in clinical
trials;

·

meet applicable regulatory standards;

·

be capable of being produced in commercial
quantities at acceptable costs; or

·

if approved for commercial sale, be
successfully commercialized.

Positive results in
preclinical studies of a drug candidate may not be predictive of similar
results in humans during clinical trials, and promising results from earlier
clinical trials of a drug candidate may not be replicated in later clinical
trials. Findings in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical
trials could result in abrupt changes in our development activities, including the
possible cessation of development activities associated with a drug candidate.
Furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of
statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities
for approval of a drug candidate.

We and many other
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered
significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving
promising results in early-stage development. Accordingly, the results from the
completed preclinical studies and clinical trials and ongoing clinical trials
for our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in
later stage trials, and may not be predictive of the likelihood of approval of
a drug candidate for commercial sale.

IF WE
ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN UNITED STATES AND/OR FOREIGN REGULATORY APPROVAL, WE WILL
BE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG CANDIDATES.

Our drug candidates are
subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to their development,
clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization. Rigorous preclinical
testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are
required in the United States and in most other countries prior to the
commercial sale of our drug candidates. Satisfaction of these and other
regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to
unanticipated delays. It is possible that none of the drug candidates we are
developing independently, or in collaboration with others, will be approved for
marketing.

We have limited experience
in conducting and managing the late-stage clinical trials necessary to obtain
regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA. The time required to
complete clinical trials and for the FDA and other countries’ regulatory review
processes is uncertain and typically takes many years. Our analysis of data
obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation
and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent
regulatory approval. We may also encounter unanticipated delays or increased
costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative
action or changes in FDA policy during the period of drug development, clinical
trials and FDA regulatory review.

Any delay in obtaining or
failure to obtain required approvals could materially adversely affect our
ability to successfully commercialize any drug candidate. Furthermore, any
regulatory approval to market a drug may be subject to unexpected limitations
on the indicated uses for which we may market the drug. These limitations may
limit the size of the market for the drug.


We are also subject to
numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical
trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party
reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the
risks associated with the FDA approval process described above, as well as
risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements. Approval by the
FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United
States. Foreign jurisdictions may have different approval procedures than those
required by the FDA and may impose additional testing requirements for our drug
candidates.

IF
CLINICAL TRIALS FOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ARE PROLONGED OR DELAYED, WE
MAY BE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ON A TIMELY BASIS,
WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND WOULD DELAY OUR RECEIPT OF
ANY PRODUCT REVENUE.

We
cannot predict whether or not we will encounter problems with any of our
completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory
authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data
from our completed or ongoing clinical trials. Any of the following could delay
the clinical development of our drug candidates:

·

ongoing
discussions with the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope
or design of our clinical trials;

·

delays
in receiving or the inability to obtain required approvals from the independent
institutional review board at one or more of the institutions at which a
clinical trial is conducted or other reviewing entities at clinical sites
selected for participation in our clinical trials;

·

delays
in enrolling volunteers or patients into clinical trials;

·

a
lower than anticipated retention rate of volunteers or patients in clinical
trials;

·

the
need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive results or
unforeseen complications in testing;

·

inadequate
supply or deficient quality of drug candidate materials or other materials
necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;

·

unfavorable
FDA inspection and review of a clinical trial site or records of any clinical
or preclinical investigation;

·

serious
and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in our
clinical trials; or

·

the
placement by the FDA of a clinical hold on a trial.

Our ability to enroll
patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis
will be subject to a number of factors, including the size of the patient
population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical
sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the
number of other clinical trials competing for patients in the same indication and
the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. In addition, subjects may drop
out of our clinical trials, and thereby possibly impair the validity or
statistical significance of the trials. Delays in patient enrollment or
unforeseen drop-out rates may result in increased costs and longer development times.
While all or a portion of these additional costs may be covered by payments
under our collaborative agreements, we bear all of the costs for our
development candidates for which we have no financial support from a
collaborator.

We, the FDA or other applicable
regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any
time if we or they believe the subjects or patients participating in such
clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other
reasons.

In addition, it is
impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether
FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the
impact of such changes, if any, may be. If we experience any such problems, we
may not have the financial resources to continue development of the drug
candidate that is affected or the development of any of our other drug
candidates.


IF
OUR COMPETITORS BRING SUPERIOR DRUGS TO MARKET OR BRING THEIR DRUGS TO MARKET
BEFORE WE DO, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A MARKET FOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATES.

Our drug candidates in
development may not be able to compete effectively with drugs that are
currently on the market or new drugs that may be developed by others. There are
many other companies developing drugs for the same indications that we are
pursuing in development. In order to compete successfully in these areas, we
must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy and ease of manufacturing and gain
market acceptance over competing drugs that may receive regulatory approval
before or after our drug candidates, and over those that currently are
marketed. Many of our competitors, including major pharmaceutical companies
such as GlaxoSmithKline, Wyeth, Pfizer, Roche, Amgen, Novartis, Johnson &
Johnson and Schering-Plough possess substantially greater financial,
technical and human resources than we possess. In addition, many of our
competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in conducting
preclinical and nonclinical testing and human clinical trials of drug
candidates, scaling up manufacturing operations and obtaining regulatory
approvals of drugs and manufacturing facilities. Accordingly, our competitors
may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for drugs more rapidly than we do.
If we obtain regulatory approval and launch commercial sales of our drug
candidates, we also will compete with respect to manufacturing efficiency and
sales and marketing capabilities, areas in which we currently have limited
experience.

IF
OUR PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE
COULD BE SUBJECT TO DELAYS IN FILING NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS ON
MARKETING OF DRUGS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN APPROVED.

We currently are
developing drug candidates for regulatory approval for the first time since our
inception, and are in the process of implementing regulated processes and
systems required to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our drug
candidates. Certain of these processes and systems for conducting clinical
trials and manufacturing material must be compliant with regulatory
requirements before we can apply for regulatory approval for our drug
candidates. These processes and systems will be subject to continual review and
periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. If we are unable to
achieve compliance in a timely fashion, we may experience delays in filing for
regulatory approval for our drug candidates. In addition, any later discovery
of previously unknown problems or safety issues with approved drugs or
manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may
result in restrictions on such drugs or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of drugs
from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by
the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for
marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we are
a party to collaboration agreements that transfer responsibility for complying
with specified regulatory requirements, such as filing and maintenance of
marketing authorizations and safety reporting, to our collaborator. If our
collaborators do not fulfill these regulatory obligations, any drugs for which
we or they obtain approval may be withdrawn from the market, which would have a
material adverse effect on our business.

EVEN
IF WE OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS, OUR DRUG CANDIDATES WILL BE SUBJECT TO
ONGOING REGULATORY REVIEW. IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CONTINUING UNITED STATES
AND APPLICABLE FOREIGN REGULATIONS, WE COULD LOSE THOSE APPROVALS, AND OUR
BUSINESS WOULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED.

Even if we receive
regulatory approval of any drug candidates that we are developing, we will be
subject to continuing regulatory review, including the review of clinical
results that are reported after our drug candidates become commercially
available, approved drugs. Since drugs are more widely used by patients once
approval has been obtained, side effects and other problems may be observed
after approval that were not seen or anticipated during pre-approval clinical
trials. In addition, the manufacturers and the manufacturing facilities we
engage to make any of our drug candidates will also be subject to periodic


review
and inspection by the FDA. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown
problems with the drug, manufacturers or manufacturing facilities may result in
restrictions on the drug, manufacturers or facilities, including withdrawal of
the drug from the market or our inability to use the facilities to make our
drug. If we fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements,
we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval,
product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.

OUR
DRUG DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE DATA-DRIVEN AND THEREFORE POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO
ABRUPT CHANGES IN EXPECTED OUTCOMES.

Small molecule drug
discovery and development involve, initially, the identification of chemical
compounds that may have promise as treatments for specific diseases. Once
identified as drug candidates, compounds are subjected to years of testing in a
laboratory setting, in animals and in humans. Our ultimate objective is to
determine whether the drug candidates have physical characteristics, both
intrinsically and in animal and human systems and include a toxicological
profile, that are compatible with clinical and commercial success in treatment
of the disease being targeted. Throughout this process, experiments are
conducted and data are gathered that could reinforce a decision to move to the
next step in the investigation process for a particular drug candidate, could
result in uncertainty over the proper course to pursue, or could result in the
termination of further drug development efforts with respect to the compound
being evaluated. We monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical
studies and clinical trials and regularly evaluate and re-evaluate our
portfolio investments with the objective of balancing risk and potential return
in view of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights. This
process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new
information comes to light and we gain additional insights into ongoing
programs and potential new programs.

WE
DEPEND ON OUR COLLABORATORS TO WORK WITH US TO DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE AND
COMMERCIALIZE MANY OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES.

We have granted
development and commercialization rights to telaprevir to Janssen (worldwide
other than North America and Far East) and to Mitsubishi (Far East). We also
have granted Far East rights to VX-702 to our collaborator Kissei. We
expect to receive significant financial support under our Janssen collaboration
agreement, as well as meaningful technical and manufacturing contributions to
the telaprevir program. The success of some of our key in-house programs, such
as for telaprevir and VX-702, is dependent upon the continued financial
and other support that our collaborators have agreed to provide.

For some drug candidates
on which we are not currently focusing our development efforts, we have granted
worldwide rights to a collaborator, such as our MK-0457 (VX-680) and MK-6592
(VX-667) collaboration with Merck, our Lexiva/Telzir and VX-409
collaborations with GlaxoSmithKline and our AVN-944 (VX-944)
collaboration with Avalon.

The success of our
collaborations depends on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Each
of our collaborators has significant discretion in determining the efforts and
resources that it will apply to the collaboration. Our existing collaborations
may not be scientifically or commercially successful.

The
risks that we face in connection with these existing and any future
collaborations include the following:

·

Our
collaboration agreements are subject to termination under various
circumstances, including, as in the case of our agreement with Janssen,
termination without cause. Any such termination could have an adverse material
effect on our financial condition and/or delay the development and commercial
sale of our drug candidates, including telaprevir.

·

Our
collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization
efforts. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies historically have
re-evaluated their development and commercialization priorities following
mergers and consolidations, which have been common in recent years in these
industries. The ability of some of our drug candidates to reach their potential


could be limited if
our collaborators decrease or fail to increase development or commercialization
efforts related to those drug candidates.

·

Our
collaboration agreements may have the effect of limiting the areas of research
and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third
parties.

·

Our collaborators may
develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, drugs that are similar
to or competitive with the drugs or drug candidates that are the subject of the
collaboration with us.

IF WE
ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN COLLABORATORS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND
COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR DRUGS AND DRUG CANDIDATES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
FUND OUR DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES.

Our collaborators have
agreed to fund portions of our research and development programs and/or to
conduct the development and commercialization of specified drug candidates and,
if they are approved, drugs. In exchange, we have given them technology, sales
and marketing rights relating to those drugs and drug candidates. Some of our
corporate collaborators have rights to control the planning and execution of drug
development and clinical programs including for our drug candidates MK-0457 (

vx

-680), MK-6592 (

vx

-667), VX-409 and AVN-944 (VX-944).
Our collaborators may exercise their control rights in ways that may negatively
affect the timing and success of those programs. Our collaborations are subject
to termination rights by the collaborators. If any of our collaborators were to
terminate its relationship with us, or fail to meet its contractual
obligations, that action could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
undertake research, to fund related and other programs and to develop,
manufacture and market any drugs that may have resulted from the collaboration.
We expect to seek additional collaborative arrangements, which may not be
available to us, to develop and commercialize our drug candidates in the
future. Even if we are able to establish acceptable collaborative arrangements
in the future, they may not be successful.

OUR
INVESTMENT IN THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURE OF COMMERCIAL SUPPLY OF TELAPREVIR
MAY NOT RESULT IN ANY BENEFIT TO US IF TELAPREVIR IS NOT APPROVED FOR
COMMERCIAL SALE.

We are investing
significant resources in the clinical development of telaprevir. In 2006, we
increased our investment in telaprevir to support our Phase 2b clinical
development program. Telaprevir is the first drug candidate for which we expect
to perform all activities related to late stage development, drug supply,
registration and commercialization in a major market. Even though telaprevir is
a Phase 2b drug candidate, we are planning for and investing significant
resources now in preparation for Phase 3 clinical trials, application for
marketing approval, commercial supply and sales and marketing. We also expect
to incur significant costs in 2007 to manufacture registration batches and invest
in telaprevir commercial supply. Our engagement in these resource-intensive
activities could make it more difficult for us to maintain our portfolio focus,
and puts significant investment at risk if we do not obtain regulatory approval
and successfully commercialize telaprevir in North America. There is no
assurance that our development of telaprevir will lead successfully to
regulatory approval, or that obtaining regulatory approval will lead to
commercial success. If telaprevir is not approved for commercial sale or if its
development is delayed for any reason, our full investment in telaprevir may be
at risk and our business and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected.

WE DEPEND
ON THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS TO DISTRIBUTE CLINICAL TRIAL MATERIALS FOR
CLINICAL TRIALS AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO RELY ON THEM TO MEET OUR COMMERCIAL
SUPPLY NEEDS FOR ANY DRUG CANDIDATE THAT IS APPROVED FOR SALE. WE MAY NOT BE
ABLE TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN THESE RELATIONSHIPS AND ARE SUBJECT TO SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS
OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL.

If we are successful in
advancing our proprietary drug candidates through clinical development, we plan
to establish and maintain a commercial supply chain and build our logistics and
quality control


capabilities.
We currently are relying on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers to
manufacture and distribute our drug candidates for clinical trials, and we
expect that we will continue to do so to meet our commercial supply needs for
these drugs, if they are approved for sale. As a result of our reliance on
these third-party manufacturers and suppliers, including sole source suppliers
of certain components of our drug candidates and drugs, we may be subject to
significant supply disruptions outside of our control.

We have retained
manufacturing and commercialization responsibilities for telaprevir in North
America. Establishing the commercial supply chain for telaprevir is a
multi-step international endeavor involving the purchase of several raw
materials, the application of certain manufacturing processes requiring
significant lead times, the conversion of active pharmaceutical ingredient to
tablet form and the packaging of tablets for distribution. We expect to source
raw materials, drug substance and drug product, including finished packaging,
from third parties located in the Far East, the European Union and the United
States, and we are currently establishing and expanding third-party
relationships in this regard. Establishing and providing quality assurance for
this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment,
experienced personnel and the creation or expansion of numerous third-party contractual
relationships. While we believe that there are multiple third parties that are
capable of providing the materials and services that we need in order to
manufacture and distribute telaprevir, if it is approved for sale, some of
these services are in high demand and capacity is constrained.

T

here can be no assurance that we will
be able to establish and maintain this commercial supply chain on commercially
reasonable terms in order to support a timely launch of telaprevir or at all.

We plan to identify and
enter into commercial relationships with multiple third-party manufacturers in
order to reduce the risk of supply chain disruption by limiting our reliance on
any one manufacturer. In addition, we are in the process of transferring
technical information regarding the manufacture of telaprevir to Janssen so
that Janssen will be able to manufacture telaprevir, if approved, for sale in
Janssen’s territories and as a secondary source for us. There is no assurance,
however, that we will be able to establish second sources for each stage of
manufacturing of telaprevir, or any other drug or drug candidate, or that any
second source will be able to produce sufficient quantities in the required
timeframe to avoid a supply chain disruption if there is a problem with one of
our suppliers.

Even if we successfully
establish arrangements with third-party manufacturers, supply disruptions may
result from a number of factors including shortages in product raw materials,
labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions,
shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party
manufacturer on which we rely.

Any supply disruptions
could impact the timing of our clinical trials and the commercial launch of any
approved pharmaceutical drugs. Furthermore, we may be required to modify our
production methods to permit us to economically manufacture our drugs for
commercial launch and sale. Upon approval of a pharmaceutical drug for sale, if
any, we similarly may be at risk of supply chain disruption for our commercial
drug supply. These modifications may require us to reevaluate our resources and
the resources of our third-party manufacturers, which could result in abrupt
changes in our production methods and supplies. The production of our drug
candidates is based in part on technology that we believe to be proprietary. We
have licensed this technology to enable our third-party manufacturers to
manufacture drug candidates for us. However, in the course of their services, a
contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture
of our drug candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently or
jointly with us. This would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or
require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have our
products manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process.

WE
RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO CONDUCT OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, AND THOSE THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT
PERFORM SATISFACTORILY, INCLUDING FAILING TO MEET ESTABLISHED DEADLINES
FOR THE COMPLETION OF SUCH TRIALS.

We do not have the ability
to independently conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates, and we rely
on third parties such as contract research organizations, medical institutions
and clinical investigators to


enroll
qualified patients and conduct our clinical trials. Our reliance on these third
parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these
activities. Accordingly, these third-party contractors may not complete
activities on schedule, or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance
with regulatory requirements or our trial design. If these third parties do not
successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we
may be required to replace them. Although we believe that there are a number of
other third-party contractors we could engage to continue these
activities, it may result in a delay of the affected trial. Accordingly, our
efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug
candidates may be delayed.

IF WE
ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP INDEPENDENT SALES AND MARKETING CAPABILITIES OR ESTABLISH
THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS FOR THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES, WE
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG CANDIDATES EVEN IF WE
ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL.

We currently have no experience
as a company in sales and marketing or with respect to pricing and obtaining
adequate third-party reimbursement for drugs. GlaxoSmithKline currently has
exclusive sales and marketing rights to Lexiva/Telzir. We will need to either
develop marketing capabilities and an independent sales force or enter into
arrangements with third parties to sell and market any of our drug candidates
if they are approved for sale by regulatory authorities.

In order to market
telaprevir in North America if it is approved, we intend to build a marketing
organization and a direct sales force, which will require substantial efforts
and significant management and financial resources. During 2007, we intend to commit
significant personnel and financial resources to this effort, staging our
commitments to the extent possible in consideration of the ongoing telaprevir
development timeline. We will need to devote significant effort, in particular,
to recruiting individuals with experience in the sales and marketing of
pharmaceutical products. Competition for personnel with these skills is intense
and may be particularly difficult for us since telaprevir is still an investigational
drug candidate. In addition, if we develop our own marketing and sales
capability, we may be competing with other companies that currently have
experienced and well-funded marketing and sales operations. As a result, we may
not be able to successfully develop our own marketing capabilities or
independent sales force for telaprevir in North America in order to support an
effective launch of telaprevir if it is approved for sale.

We have granted
commercialization rights to other pharmaceutical companies with respect to
certain of our drug candidates in certain geographic locations, including
telaprevir (Janssen worldwide except for North America and the Far East, and
Mitsubishi in the Far East), MK-0457 (VX-680) and MK-6592 (VX-667) (Merck
worldwide) and AVN-944 (VX-944) (Avalon worldwide). To the extent that our
collaborators have commercial rights to our drugs, any revenues we receive from
any approved drugs, will depend primarily on the sales and marketing efforts of
others. We do not know whether we will be able to enter into additional
third-party sales and marketing arrangements with respect to any of our other
drug candidates on acceptable terms, if at all, or whether we will be able to
leverage the sales and marketing capabilities we intend to build for telaprevir
in order to market and sell any other drug candidate if it is approved for
sale.

WE MAY NEED
TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.

We
expect to incur substantial research and development and related supporting
expenses as we design and develop existing and future compounds, undertake
clinical trials of drug candidates resulting from such compounds, and build our
manufacturing, regulatory, development and commercial capabilities. We also
expect to incur substantial administrative and commercialization expenses in
the future. We may need to make significant capital investment in building our
manufacturing capacity and creating pre-launch inventory for one or more
of our drug candidates. We anticipate that we will finance these substantial
cash needs with:

·

cash
received from our existing collaborative agreements;


·

cash
received from new collaborative agreements;

·

Lexiva/Telzir
royalty revenue;

·

existing
cash reserves, together with interest earned on those reserves; and

·

future
product sales to the extent that we market drugs directly.

We expect that funds from
these sources will be sufficient to fund our planned activities for at least
the next eighteen

months from the date of this filing. If we need additional capital, it
will be necessary to raise additional funds through public offerings or private
placements of equity or debt securities or other methods of financing. Even if
our financial resources are sufficient to meet our short or intermediate term
needs, we may still decide, as we have in the past, to raise additional funds
when we believe financial market conditions are favorable. Any equity
financings could result in dilution to our then-existing security holders. Any
debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that, among other things,
restrict our ability to pay dividends and interest (although we do not intend
to pay dividends for the foreseeable future). The required interest payments
associated with any significant additional debt financing could materially
adversely affect our ability to service our convertible subordinated notes and
convertible senior subordinated notes. The terms of any additional debt
financing may also, under certain circumstances, restrict or prohibit us from
making interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes. If adequate
funds are not available, we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue
one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs (including
clinical trials), or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with
collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of
our technologies, drugs or drug candidates. Additional financing may not be
available on acceptable terms, if at all.

IF WE
FAIL TO EXPAND OUR HUMAN RESOURCES AND MANAGE OUR GROWTH EFFECTIVELY, OUR
BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.

We expect that if our
clinical drug candidates continue to progress in development, we continue to
build our commercial organization and our drug discovery efforts continue to
generate drug candidates, we will require significant additional investment in
personnel, management systems and resources. For example, the number of our
full time employees increased by 17% in 2006, and we expect to experience
significant growth in 2007. Our ability to commercialize our drug candidates,
achieve our research and development objectives, and satisfy our commitments
under our collaboration agreements depends on our ability to respond
effectively to these demands and expand our internal organization to
accommodate additional anticipated growth. If we are unable to manage our
growth effectively, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS COULD MATERIALLY
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

We
have manufacturing, collaborative and clinical trial relationships, and we and
our collaborators are seeking approval for our drug candidates, outside the
United States. In addition, we expect that if telaprevir is approved for
commercial sale, a significant portion of our commercial supply chain,
including sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing, will be located in the
Far East and European Union. Consequently, we are, and will continue to be,
subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries. Risks associated
with conducting operations in foreign countries include:

·

differing
regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;

·

unexpected
changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;

·

economic
weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign
economies and markets;

·

compliance
with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or travelling
abroad;


·

foreign
taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;

·

foreign
currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses or
reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating
a subsidiary in another country;

·

workforce
uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United
States;

·

production
shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or
manufacturing capabilities abroad; and

·

business
interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and
terrorism.

These and other risks
associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect
our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.

IF WE
LOSE OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE
MARKETPLACE.

We believe that our
integrated drug discovery capability gives us a technological advantage over
our competitors. However, the pharmaceutical research field is characterized by
rapid technological progress and intense competition. As a result, we may not
realize the expected benefits from these technologies. For example, a large
pharmaceutical company, with significantly more resources than we have, could
pursue a systematic approach to the discovery of drugs based on gene families,
using proprietary drug targets, compound libraries, novel chemical approaches,
structural protein analysis and information technologies. Such a company might
identify broadly applicable compound classes faster and more effectively than
we do. Further, we believe that interest in the application of structure-based
drug design, parallel drug design and related approaches has accelerated as the
strategies have become more widely understood. Businesses, academic
institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research
organizations are conducting research to develop technologies that may compete
with those we use. It is possible that our competitors could acquire or develop
technologies that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive. For
example, a competitor could develop information technologies that accelerate
the atomic-level analysis of potential compounds that bind to the active
site of a drug target, and predict the absorption, toxicity, and relative
ease-of-synthesis of candidate compounds. If we were unable to access the same
technologies at an acceptable price, our business could be adversely affected.

THE
LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF KEY EMPLOYEES OR THE FAILURE TO HIRE QUALIFIED
EMPLOYEES WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND FUTURE GROWTH.

Because our drug discovery
and development activities are highly technical in nature, we require the
services of highly qualified and trained scientists who have the skills
necessary to conduct these activities. In addition, as we attempt to grow our
capabilities with respect to clinical development, regulatory affairs, quality
control and sales and marketing, we will need to attract and retain employees
with experience in these fields. Our future success will depend in large part
on the continued services of our key scientific and management personnel. We
have entered into employment agreements with some individuals and provide
compensation-related benefits to all of our key employees that vest over
time and therefore induce them to remain with us. However, the employment
agreements can be terminated by the employee on relatively short notice. The
value to employees of stock-related benefits that vest over time—such as
options and restricted stock—will be significantly affected by movements in our
stock price that we cannot control, and may at any point in time be
insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies.


We face intense
competition for our personnel from our competitors, our collaborators and other
companies throughout our industry. Moreover, the growth of local biotechnology
companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the Boston
area have increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees,
especially in technical fields, and the high cost of living in the Boston and
San Diego areas makes it difficult to attract employees from other parts of the
country. A failure to retain, as well as hire, train and effectively integrate
into our organization a sufficient number of qualified scientists and
professionals would negatively affect our business and our ability to grow our
business. In addition, the level of funding under certain of our collaborative
agreements depends on the number of our employees performing research and/or
development under those agreements. If we cannot hire and retain the required
personnel, funding received under the agreements may be reduced.

IF
OUR PATENTS DO NOT PROTECT OUR DRUGS, OR OUR DRUGS INFRINGE THIRD-PARTY
PATENTS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES.

We have numerous patent
applications pending in the United States, as well as foreign counterparts in
other countries. Our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability
to obtain and maintain United States and foreign patent protection for our drugs,
their uses and our processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate
without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We do not know
whether any patents will issue from any of our patent applications or, even if
patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide us with any
significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be valuable
commercially. Legal standards relating to the validity of patents and the
proper scope of their claims in the pharmaceutical field are still evolving,
and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims
in biopharmaceutical patents or the effect of prior art on them. If we are not
able to obtain adequate patent protection, our ability to prevent competitors
from making, using and selling similar drugs will be limited. Furthermore, our
activities may infringe the claims of patents held by third parties. Defense
and prosecution of infringement or other intellectual property claims, as well
as participation in other inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and
time-consuming, regardless of whether or not the outcome is favorable to us. If
the outcome of any such litigation or proceeding were adverse, we could be
subject to significant liabilities to third parties, could be required to
obtain licenses from third parties or could be required to cease sales of
affected drugs, any of which outcomes could have a material adverse effect on
our business.

WE DO
NOT KNOW WHETHER LEXIVA/TELZIR WILL CONTINUE TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET
FOR HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS.

We currently receive
royalties from sales of Lexiva/Telzir under our collaboration with
GlaxoSmithKline. Lexiva/Telzir’s share of the worldwide protease inhibitor
market may decrease due to competitive forces and market dynamics. Other HIV
PIs including Bristol-Myers Squibbs’ Reyataz

®

and
Abbott Laboratories’ Kaletra

®

,
and a number of other products are on the market for the treatment of HIV
infection and AIDS. Other drugs are still in development by our competitors,
including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim and
Johnson & Johnson, which may have better efficacy, fewer side effects,
easier administration and/or lower costs than Lexiva/Telzir. Moreover, the
growth in the worldwide market for HIV PIs has, to a certain extent, occurred
as a result of early and aggressive treatment of HIV infection with a protease
inhibitor-based regimen. Changes in treatment strategy, in which
treatment is initiated later in the course of infection, or in which treatment
is more often initiated with a regimen that does not include a protease
inhibitor, may result in reduced use of HIV PIs. As a result, the total market
for HIV PIs may decline, decreasing the sales potential of Lexiva/Telzir.
Further, although we provide education efforts related to the promotion of
Lexiva/Telzir in the United States and key markets in Europe, GlaxoSmithKline
directs the majority of the marketing and sales efforts and the positioning of Lexiva/Telzir
in the overall market, and we have little control over the direction or success
of those efforts. GlaxoSmithKline has the right to terminate its agreement with
us without cause upon twelve months’ notice, and would have no obligation to
pay further royalties to us upon any such termination.


IF
PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS AND THIRD-PARTY PAYORS DO NOT ACCEPT OUR FUTURE
DRUGS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE, IF ANY.

Even
if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market
acceptance among physicians, patients and health care payors. Physicians may
elect not to recommend our drugs for a variety of reasons including:

·

the
timing of the market introduction of competitive drugs;

·

lower
demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs;

·

lack
of cost-effectiveness;

·

lack
of availability of reimbursement from third-party payors;

·

convenience
and ease of administration;

·

prevalence
and severity of adverse side effects;

·

other
potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and

·

ineffective
marketing and distribution support.

If our approved drugs fail
to achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant
revenue.

IF
THE GOVERNMENT AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYORS FAIL TO PROVIDE COVERAGE AND
ADEQUATE PAYMENT RATES FOR OUR FUTURE DRUGS, OUR REVENUE AND PROSPECTS FOR
PROFITABILITY WILL BE HARMED.

In both domestic and
foreign markets, our sales of any future drugs will depend in part upon the
availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Such third-party
payors include government health programs such as Medicare, managed care
providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party
payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by demanding
price discounts or rebates and limiting both the types and variety of drugs
that they will cover and the amounts that they will pay for these drugs. As a
result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our future drugs. We
might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the
cost-effectiveness of any future drugs to such payors’ satisfaction. Such
studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and
financial and other resources. Our future drugs might not ultimately be
considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party reimbursement might not
be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an
appropriate return on investment in product development.

Reimbursement rates may vary
according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used,
may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost products that are already
reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or
services, and may reflect budgetary constraints and/or imperfections in
Medicare or Medicaid data used to calculate these rates. Net prices for drugs
may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government health
care programs. In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress that,
if enacted, would permit more widespread importation of drugs from foreign
countries into the United States, which may include importation from countries
where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the United States. Such legislation,
or similar regulatory changes or relaxation of laws that restrict imports of
drugs from other countries, could reduce the net price we receive for our
marketed drugs.


OUR
BUSINESS HAS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS. IF WE ARE UNABLE
TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF INSURANCE, A PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

Our business exposes us to
significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the
development, manufacturing and sales and marketing of human therapeutic
products. We currently have clinical trial insurance and will seek to obtain
product liability insurance prior to the sales and marketing of any of our drug
candidates. However, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage against
potential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability
insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to
maintain current amounts of insurance coverage or obtain additional or
sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect against losses that could
have a material adverse effect on us. If a claim is brought against us, we
might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well
as uncovered damages awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against
us. Furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any
such claims, we might be required to direct significant financial and
managerial resources to such defense, and adverse publicity is likely to result.

IF WE
DO NOT COMPLY WITH LAWS REGULATING THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH
AND HUMAN SAFETY, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

Our research and
development efforts involve the controlled use of hazardous materials,
chemicals and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our
safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the
standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental
contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an
accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be
substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and
workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures,
exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous
materials. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for
costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of
these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against
potential liabilities. Due to the small amount of hazardous materials that we
generate, we have determined that the cost to secure insurance coverage for
environmental liability and toxic tort claims far exceeds the benefits.
Accordingly, we do not maintain any insurance to cover pollution conditions or
other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of
hazardous materials. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations
affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial
costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of
these laws or regulations.

WE
HAVE ADOPTED ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS THAT MAY FRUSTRATE ANY ATTEMPT TO
REMOVE OR REPLACE OUR CURRENT MANAGEMENT.

Our corporate charter and
by-law provisions and stockholder rights plan may discourage certain types of
transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of Vertex that
might be beneficial to us or our security holders. Our charter provides for
staggered terms for the members of the Board of Directors. Our by-laws grant
the directors a right to adjourn annual meetings of stockholders, and certain
provisions of the by-laws may be amended only with an 80% stockholder vote.
Pursuant to our stockholder rights plan, each share of common stock has an
associated preferred share purchase right. The rights will not trade separately
from the common stock until, and are exercisable only upon, the acquisition or
the potential acquisition through tender offer by a person or group of 15% or
more of the outstanding common stock. We may issue shares of any class or
series of preferred stock in the future without stockholder approval and upon
such terms as our Board of Directors may determine. The rights of the holders
of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the
rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be
issued in the future. As a result, stockholders or other parties may find it
more difficult to remove or replace our current management.


OUR
STOCK PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE BASED ON FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

Market
prices for securities of companies such as Vertex are highly volatile. Within
the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, our common stock traded between
$26.50 and $45.38 per share. The market for our stock, like that of other
companies in the biotechnology field, has from time to time experienced
significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our operating
performance. The future market price of our securities could be significantly
and adversely affected by factors such as:

·

announcements
of results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies;

·

announcements
of financial results and other operating performance measures, or capital
structuring activities;

·

technological
innovations or the introduction of new drugs by our competitors;

·

government
regulatory action;

·

public
concern as to the safety of drugs developed by others;

·

developments
in patent or other intellectual property rights or announcements relating to
these matters;

·

developments
in domestic and international governmental policy or regulation, for example
relating to intellectual property rights; and

·

developments relating
specifically to other companies and market conditions for pharmaceutical and
biotechnology stocks in general.

OUR
OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL
FINANCING OR REDUCE OUR FLEXIBILITY TO ACT IN OUR BEST INTERESTS.

As of December 31,
2006, we had approximately $42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of
5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due in September 2007 and approximately
$

59.6

million in aggregate
principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due in February 2011
outstanding. In February 2007, we announced that we will redeem the 5.75%
Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due in February 2011 on March 5,
2007 after which our outstanding indebtedness will be significantly reduced. Notwithstanding
the redemption of our convertible senior subordinated notes in March 2007, the
level of our indebtedness will affect us by:

·

exposing
us to fixed rates of interest, which may be in excess of prevailing market
rates;

·

making
it more difficult to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital
expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;

·

constraining
our ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic climate or to changes
in our business or the pharmaceutical industry; and

·

requiring the dedication of
a substantial portion of our expected cash flow to service of our indebtedness,
thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes.

OUR
ESTIMATES OF OUR LIABILITY UNDER OUR KENDALL SQUARE LEASE MAY BE
INACCURATE.

We leased a 290,000 square
foot facility in Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts in January 2003
for a 15-year term. We currently are occupying approximately 120,000
square feet of the facility. We have sublease arrangements in place for the
remaining rentable square footage of the facility. In determining our
obligations under the lease for the portion of the facility that we are not
occupying, we have made certain assumptions relating to the time necessary to
sublease the space after the expiration of the initial subleases, projected
future sublease rental rates and the anticipated durations of future subleases.
Our


estimates
have changed in the past, and may change in the future, resulting in additional
adjustments to the estimate of liability, and the effect of any such
adjustments could be material.

GOVERNMENT
INVESTIGATIONS OR LITIGATION AGAINST OUR COLLABORATORS COULD IMPACT OUR
BUSINESS.

The federal government,
certain state governments and private payors are investigating and have begun
to file actions against numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
alleging that the reporting of prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted
in a false and overstated Average Wholesale Price, or AWP, which in turn is
alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by Medicare beneficiaries,
insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans and others to health care
providers who prescribed and administered those products. Some payors are also
alleging that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are not reporting
their “best price” to the states under the Medicaid program. In addition,
recent government litigation against pharmaceutical companies has focused on
allegations of off-label promotion in connection with the filing of false
claims for government reimbursement. In any AWP cases or other cases brought by
the government where our collaborators or licensees are named as defendants
with respect to any products licensed from us, the outcome of the case could
have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

SALES
OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON
STOCK TO DECLINE.

Sales of substantial
amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such
shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. In
addition, the issuance of common stock upon exercise of any outstanding option
or the conversion of any of our outstanding convertible debt would be dilutive,
and may cause the market price for a share of our common stock to decline. As
of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 126.1 million shares of
common stock issued and outstanding. We also had outstanding options to
purchase approximately 14.3 million shares of common stock with a weighted
average exercise price of $26.44 per share. Our outstanding notes were
convertible into approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock with a
weighted average conversion price of $22.87 per share. Outstanding options and
convertible notes may be exercised or converted, as the case may be, if the market
price of our common stock exceeds the applicable exercise or conversion price.

PROPERTIES

We lease an aggregate of
approximately 650,000 square feet of laboratory and office space in nine
facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The leases have expiration dates
ranging from 2009 to 2018. We have the option to extend the lease for our
headquarters facility at 130 Waverly Street, Cambridge, where we lease
approximately 100,000 square feet of space, for one additional term of five
years, ending in 2015, with respect to one portion of the building, and for up
to two additional terms of five years, ending in 2019, for the other portion of
the building. The lease for approximately 192,000 square feet of laboratory and
office space at 200 Sidney Street, located adjacent to our headquarters, will
expire in 2010. We have the option to extend that lease for up to two
additional consecutive ten-year terms. The lease for our 21 Erie Street
facility for 21,000 square feet of office space, which we entered into in November 2006,
expires in May 2012 with the option to extent for two additional
consecutive five-year terms.

The lease for our Kendall
Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts facility will expire in 2018. We have the
option to extend that lease for two consecutive terms of ten years each. We
have subleased approximately 145,000 square feet of the facility, and are using
the remaining approximately 120,000 square feet of space leased in the facility
for our research operations. The subleases are for terms ending in 2011 and
2012 with extension options to 2015 and 2018. One of the subleases has certain
termination provisions beginning in 2010.

We also lease
approximately 81,200 square feet of laboratory and office space in San Diego,
California. The lease for this space will expire on August 31, 2008. We
have the option to extend this lease for up to two additional terms of five
years each.

We lease approximately
22,000 square feet of laboratory and office space in Milton Park, Abingdon,
England, for our United Kingdom business and research and development

Under the terms of our
1996 Stock and Option Plan and 2006 Stock and Option Plan, we may award shares
of restricted stock to our employees and consultants. These shares of restricted
stock typically are subject to a lapsing right of repurchase by us. We may
exercise this right of repurchase in the event that a restricted stock
recipient’s service to us is terminated. If we exercise this right, we are
required to repay the purchase price paid by or on behalf of the recipient for
the repurchased restricted shares, which typically is the par value per share
of $0.01. Repurchased shares are returned to the applicable Stock and Option
Plan under which they were issued. Shares returned to the 2006 Stock and Option
Plan are available for future awards under the terms of that plan.

Unregistered Sales
of Equity Securities

On February 2, 2007, we called our 2011 Notes for

During 2006 we sold 817,749
shares of Altus Pharmaceuticals common stock for approximately $11.7 million,
and the Altus warrants for approximately $18.3 million. As a result of the
sales of Altus common stock and warrants, we recorded a realized gain on a sale
of investment of $11.2 million

In the third quarter of
2005, holders of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due in
September 2007 (“2007 Notes”) exchanged $40.5 million in aggregate
principal amount of 2007 Notes, plus interest, for approximately
2.5 million shares of newly issued common stock. As a result of this
exchange, we incurred a non-cash charge of approximately $36.3 million. In
separate transactions, in the fourth quarter of 2005, holders of 5.75%
Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due in February 2011 (“2011 Notes”)
exchanged $114.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2011 Notes,
plus interest, for approximately 8.1 million shares of newly issued common
stock. As a result of this exchange, a non-cash charge of approximately
$11.9 million was incurred. These charges relate to the incremental shares
issued in the transactions over the number of shares that would have been
issued upon conversion of the notes at the conversion prices set forth therein.

In the third quarter of
2006, holders of 2011 Notes exchanged $58.3 million in aggregate principal amount
of 2011 Notes, plus accrued interest, for approximately 4.1 million shares of
newly issued common stock. As a result of this exchange, we incurred a non-cash
charge of approximately $5.2 million. This charge relates to the
incremental shares issued in the transaction over the number of shares that
would have been issued upon conversion of the notes at the conversion prices
set forth therein.

During 2004, we issued
approximately $232.4 million in aggregate principal amount of 2011 Notes in
exchange for an equal principal amount of our outstanding 2007 Notes. The
Company recorded a charge related to the write-off of the unamortized deferred
issuance costs applicable to the 2007 Notes retired.

We sold certain assets
and liabilities of our Discovery Tools and Services business in two independent
transactions in March and December 2003. In October 2001, the
FASB issued Statement No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets” (“FAS 144”). Pursuant to FAS 144, the Statement of Operations
data shown above give effect to the disposition of the assets sold, accounting
for such assets as discontinued operations.

Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”) requires us
to recognize expense only for restricted shares expected to vest, and this results
in us being required to estimate forfeitures on grant date. In connection with
the adoption of FAS 123(R) we recorded a $1.0 million benefit due to the
cumulative effect of estimating forfeitures on the grant date rather than
recording them as they occur.

2007, we announced that we will redeem our 2011 Notes on March 5, 2007.


ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We are in the business of discovering, developing and
commercializing small molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases. We
have built a drug discovery capability that integrates biology, chemistry,
biophysics, automation and information technologies, with a goal of making the
drug discovery process more efficient and productive. Our most advanced drug
candidate, telaprevir, is being investigated for the treatment of hepatitis C virus
infection in three major Phase 2b clinical trials. We are investing
significant resources to expand our capabilities in clinical development,
regulatory affairs, quality control and commercial operations and to build and
manage a commercial supply chain in preparation for the Phase 3
development and the potential commercial launch of telaprevir. We also expect
to incur significant costs in 2007 to manufacture registration batches of
telaprevir and build a telaprevir commercial inventory. We have a number of
other drug candidates, including candidates targeting rheumatoid arthritis,
cystic fibrosis, bacterial infection, cancer and pain, that are being evaluated
in preclinical studies or clinical trials either by us or in collaboration with
other pharmaceutical companies. Our HIV protease inhibitor, fosamprenavir
calcium, is being marketed by our collaborator GlaxoSmithKline plc as Lexiva in
the United States and Telzir in Europe.

We currently are concentrating most of our drug
development resources on four drug candidates: telaprevir, for the treatment of
HCV infection; VX-702, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and
other inflammatory diseases; VX-770, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis;
and VX-883, for the treatment of bacterial infection. In 2007, we expect
to continue Phase 2b and commence Phase 3 clinical trials of
telaprevir, commence Phase 2 clinical trials of VX-702 and VX-770
and commence a Phase 1 clinical trial of VX-883. We have retained
the right to commercialize telaprevir in North America and to commercialize VX-702
(except for the Far East), VX-770 and VX-883 worldwide. Our pipeline also
includes several drug candidates that are being developed by our collaborators.
The most advanced of these drug candidates is MK-0457 (VX-680), an Aurora kinase
inhibitor that is being developed by Merck & Co., Inc. for the treatment of
cancer. We have a number of other drug candidates in development and a
broad-based discovery effort.

Our
net loss for 2006 was $

206.9 million

,
or $1.83

per basic and diluted common
share,

and we expect to incur substantial operating losses in the future.
In 2007, we expect that our research and development expenses will be higher
than those in 2006, as we continue to incur research and development costs
related to telaprevir and our other drug candidates, establish a commercial
supply chain and build telaprevir commercial inventory to support markets where
we expect to launch telaprevir, if approved, and build our general drug
development and commercialization capabilities.

Business Focus

We have elected to diversify our research and
development activities across a relatively broad array of investment
opportunities, due in part to the high risks associated with the biotechnology
and pharmaceutical business. This diversification strategy requires more
significant financial resources than would be required if we pursued a more
limited approach. We are expending significant resources on development and
commercialization of the drug candidates for which we currently have principal
clinical development responsibility, in those markets where we have commercial
rights. We rely on collaborators to develop and commercialize certain of our
other drug candidates either worldwide or in the markets upon which we are not
currently focused.

To date, we have relied on pharmaceutical company
collaborators to develop and market our drug candidates that have advanced to
late stage clinical trials or commercialization. Telaprevir is the first drug
candidate for which we expect to perform all activities related to late stage
development, drug supply, registration and commercialization in a major market.
We have limited experience in Phase 3 clinical development, supply chain
management, or pharmaceutical sales and marketing, and we are building those


capabilities as we advance
telaprevir through clinical development. Even though telaprevir is a Phase 2b
drug candidate, we are planning for and investing significant resources now in
preparation for Phase 3 clinical trials, application for marketing
approval, commercial supply and sales and marketing. Our engagement in these
resource-intensive activities could make it more difficult for us to maintain
our portfolio focus, and puts significant investment at risk if we do not
obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize telaprevir in North
America. While we attempt to stage our investments in each drug candidate to coincide
to some degree with the occurence of risk-reducing events associated with the
development of that drug candidate, we may not be able through this approach to
reduce significantly the overall financial risk associated with our drug
development activities. There is no assurance that our development of
telaprevir will lead successfully to regulatory approval, or that obtaining
regulatory approval will lead to commercial success.

In the past, we have
sought collaborator funding for a significant portion of our research activities,
which required that we grant to those collaborators significant rights to
develop and commercialize drug candidates generated by that research. In the
future, we expect that we will fund a greater proportion of our research
programs than in past years, using internal funds rather than collaborator
funds. We believe that this strategy will ultimately allow us to retain greater
development control of, and commercial rights with respect to, those
proprietary drug candidates that may meet our strategic internal investment
criteria as in effect from time to time.

Discovery and
Development Process

Discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical
product is a lengthy and resource-intensive process, which may take 10 to
15 years or more. Throughout this entire process, potential drug candidates are
subjected to rigorous evaluation, driven in part by stringent regulatory
considerations, designed to generate information concerning efficacy, proper
dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that
are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for
marketing. The toxicity characteristics and profile of drug candidates at
varying dose levels administered for varying periods of time also are monitored
and evaluated during the nonclinical and clinical development process. Most
chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never
progress into formal development, and most drug candidates that do advance into
formal development never become commercial products. A drug candidate’s failure
to progress or advance may be the result of any one or more of a wide range of
adverse experimental outcomes including, for example, the lack of sufficient
efficacy against the disease target, the lack of acceptable absorption
characteristics or other physical properties, difficulties in developing a
cost-effective manufacturing or formulation methods or the discovery of
toxicities or side effects that are unacceptable for the disease indication
being treated.

Given the uncertainties of
the research and development process, it is not possible to predict with
confidence which, if any, of our current research and development efforts will
result in a marketable pharmaceutical product. We monitor the results of our
discovery research and our nonclinical and clinical trials and frequently
evaluate our portfolio investments in light of new data and scientific,
business and commercial insights with the objective of balancing risk and
potential. This process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and
priority as new information becomes available and we gain additional insights
into ongoing programs and potential new programs.

Clinical
Development Programs

Our development of telaprevir illustrates our focus on
maintaining greater development control of our drug candidates. We currently are
conducting later stage clinical trials of telaprevir and expect to initiate a Phase 3
program for of telaprevir in the second half of 2007. Designing and
coordinating large-scale clinical trials to determine the efficacy and safety
of drug candidates and support the submission of an NDA requires significant
financial resources, along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise
and infrastructure.


We are conducting three major Phase 2b clinical trials
of telaprevir. PROVE 1 is ongoing in the United States and PROVE 2 is ongoing
in European Union, both in treatment-naïve patients. PROVE 3 has commenced and
is being conducted with patients in North America and the European Union who did
not achieve SVR with previous interferon-based treatments. We expect the results
from these clinical trials to provide important information supporting the
design and initiation of the Phase 3 clinical program for telaprevir.

In 2007, we plan to conduct Phase 2 clinical
trials of VX-702 in patients with RA, a Phase 2 clinical trial of VX-770
in patients with CF, and a Phase 1 clinical trial of VX-883.

Each of these programs requires
a significant investment of financial and personnel resources, time and
expertise by us and/or any program collaborators to realize its full clinical
and commercial value. Development investment at this stage is subject to the
considerable risk that any one or more of these drug candidates will not
advance to product registration. Each drug candidate could fail to progress or
advance due to a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes, placing our investment
in the drug candidate at risk. While we attempt to stage our investments to
mitigate these financial risks, drug discovery and development by its nature is
a very risky undertaking and staging of investment is not always possible or
desirable. We expect to continue to evaluate and prioritize investment in our
clinical development programs based on the emergence of new clinical and
nonclinical data in each program throughout 2007 and in subsequent years.

Manufacturing and
Commercialization Strategy

We have retained manufacturing and commercialization
responsibilities for telaprevir in North America. In 2007, we expect to
undertake significant efforts to prepare for the commercial supply and marketing
of telaprevir, in support of a timely and effective commercial product launch in
subsequent years if we are successful in obtaining regulatory marketing
approval.

Establishing the commercial supply
chain for telaprevir is a multi-step international endeavor involving the
purchase of several raw materials, the application of certain manufacturing
processes requiring significant lead times, the conversion of active
pharmaceutical ingredient to tablet form and the packaging of tablets for
distribution. We expect to source raw materials, drug substance and drug
product, including finished packaging, from third parties located in the Far
East, the European Union and the United States, and we are currently
establishing and expanding third-party relationships in this regard. Establishing
and providing quality assurance for this global supply chain requires a
significant financial commitment, experienced personnel and the creation or
expansion of numerous third-party contractual relationships. Because of the
significant lead times involved in our supply chain for telaprevir, we may have
less flexibility to adjust our supply in response to changes in demand than if
we had shorter lead times.

We have successfully completed the technical
development work for the Phase 3 and commercial formulation of telaprevir.
We expect that the level of our investment in commercial supply of telaprevir,
including costs related to building our internal infrastructure and costs
related to third-party manufacturing relationships, will increase significantly
in 2007. While most of this investment will relate specifically to telaprevir,
and is at risk if telaprevir does not advance successfully to registration, we
expect that the organization and expertise that we build as part of this
process will contribute to our development as a pharmaceutical company, and that
it could serve the advancement of our other, earlier-stage drug candidates if
they progress to a commercial manufacturing stage.

Similarly, we currently
have limited experience as a company in sales and marketing or with respect to
pricing and obtaining adequate third-party reimbursement for drugs. In order to
market telaprevir in North America if it is approved, we intend to build a marketing
organization and a direct sales force, which will require substantial effort
and significant management and financial resources. During 2007, we intend to commit
significant personnel and financial resources to this effort, staging our
commitments to the extent possible in consideration of the ongoing telaprevir
development timeline. We will need to devote significant effort, in particular,
to recruiting individuals with experience in the sales and marketing of
pharmaceutical products. Competition for personnel with these skills is intense
and may be particularly difficult for us since telaprevir is still an
investigational drug candidate. Although our investment in this


infrastructure
might be lost if telaprevir is not approved or if approval is significantly
delayed, we would expect our sales and marketing infrastructure for telaprevir,
if telaprevir is successfully developed and commercialized, to be useful to us if
and when we commercialize any additional drugs.

Financing Strategy

At December 31, 2006, we had $761.8 million of cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities, $42.1 million in principal amount
of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due September 2007, which we refer to
as the 2007 Notes, and $59.6 million in principal amount of 5.75% Convertible
Senior Subordinated Notes due in February 2011, which we refer to as the 2011
Notes. Because we have incurred losses from our inception and expect to incur
losses for the foreseeable future, we are dependent in large part on our
continued ability to raise significant funding to finance our research and
development operations, our creation of a commercial infrastructure and our
overhead, and to meet our long-term contractual commitments and obligations. In
the past, we have secured funds principally through capital market
transactions, strategic collaborative agreements, proceeds from the disposition
of assets, investment income and the issuance of stock under our employee
benefit programs. For example, we received $165.0 million in July 2006 as an up-front
payment under our collaboration agreement with Janssen and we completed an
offering of 10 million shares of our common stock in September 2006, resulting
in net proceeds to us of approximately $313.7 million. In addition, we
decreased the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our convertible debt by
$58.4 million in 2006 through the issuance of approximately 4.1 million
shares of our common stock.

In February 2007, we announced that we will
redeem our 2011 Notes on March 5, 2007.  The 2011 Notes are convertible into shares of
our common stock at the option of the holder at a price equal to $14.94 per
share. We expect the holders of the 2011 Notes will elect to convert their notes
into stock, in which case we will issue approximately 4.0 million shares. We
will be required to repay any 2011 Notes that are not converted at the rate of
$1,003.19 per $1,000 principal amount, which includes principal and interest
that will accrue to the redemption date.

In order to fund our
research, development and manufacturing activities, particularly for later
stage drug candidates, we expect to continue to pursue a general financing
strategy that may lead us to undertake one or more additional capital
transactions, which may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have
engaged in the past. We cannot be sure that any such financing opportunities
will be available on acceptable terms if at all.

Collaborations and
Collaborative Revenues

Collaborations have been and will continue to be an
important component of our business strategy. We receive royalty revenues from
GlaxoSmithKline on their sales of our HIV protease inhibitor fosamprenavir  calcium, which is marketed as Lexiva in the
United States and Telzir in Europe. In June 2006, we entered into a
collaboration agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica, N.V., a Johnson &
Johnson company, relating to telaprevir. In July 2006, Janssen paid us a non-refundable
license payment of $165 million. Under our agreement with Janssen, we have
retained exclusive commercial rights to telaprevir in North America and will
lead the global clinical development program. Janssen has agreed to be responsible
for 50% of the drug development costs under the development program for telaprevir
in North America and the Janssen territories, to pay us additional contingent
milestone payments based on successful development, approval and launch of
telaprevir, and to be responsible for the commercialization of telaprevir
outside of North America and the Far East.


Our pipeline also includes several drug candidates
that are being developed by our collaborators, including:

·

MK-0457 (VX-680) and MK-6592 (VX-677), which
are being investigated by Merck for oncology indications;

·

AVN-944 (VX-944), which is being investigated
by Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for oncology indications; and

·

VX-409 and
back-up compounds, which are being investigated by GlaxoSmithKline for pain
indications.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to
make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reported periods. These items are monitored
and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material
changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are reflected
in reported results for the period in which they become known. We base our
estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to
be substantially accurate.

We believe that our
application of the accounting policies for restructuring, revenue recognition,
research and development expenses, investments and stock-based compensation,
all of which are important to our financial condition and results of
operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of
management. Our accounting polices, including the ones discussed below, are
more fully described in Note B, “Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated
financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with the SEC’s
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements” (“SAB 101”), as amended by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 104, “Revenue Recognition” (“SAB 104”), and for revenue arrangements
entered into after June 30, 2003, Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” (“EITF
00-21”).

Our revenues are generated primarily through
collaborative research, development, manufacture and commercialization
agreements. The terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of one
or more of the following: non-refundable up-front license fees, research and
development funding, milestone payments and royalties on product sales.

Agreements containing multiple elements are divided
into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including
whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the collaborator and
whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the
undelivered obligation(s). The consideration received is allocated among the
separate units based on each unit’s fair value or using the residual method,
and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the
separate units.

We recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front
license fees on a straight-line basis over the contracted or estimated period
of performance, which is typically the research or development term. Research
and development funding is recognized as earned, ratably over the period of
effort.


Substantive
milestones realized in collaboration arrangements are recognized as earned when
the corresponding payment is reasonably assured, subject to the following
policies in those circumstances where we have obligations remaining after
achievement of the milestone:

·

In
those circumstances where collection of a substantive milestone is reasonably
assured, we have remaining obligations to perform under the collaboration
arrangement and we have sufficient evidence of fair value for our remaining
obligations, we consider the milestone payment and the remaining obligations to
be separate units of accounting. In these circumstances, we use the residual
method under EITF 00-21 to allocate revenue among the milestones and the
remaining obligations.

·

In
those circumstances where collection of a substantive milestone is reasonably
assured, we have remaining obligations to perform under the collaboration
arrangement, and we do not have sufficient evidence of fair value for our
remaining obligations, we consider the milestone payment and the remaining
obligations under the contract as a single unit of accounting. In those
circumstances where the collaboration does not require specific deliverables at
specific times or at the end of the contract term, but rather our obligations
are satisfied over a period of time, substantive milestones are recognized over
the period of performance. This typically results in a portion of the milestone
payment being recognized as revenue on the date the milestone is achieved equal
to the applicable percentage of the performance period that has elapsed as of
the date the milestone is achieved, with the balance being deferred and
recognized over the remaining period of performance.

We evaluate whether milestones are substantive at the
inception of the agreement based on the contingent nature of the milestone,
specifically reviewing factors such as the scientific and other risks that must
be overcome to achieve the milestone as well as the level of effort and
investment required. Milestones that are not considered substantive and do not
meet the separation criteria are accounted for as license payments and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of performance.

Payments received after performance obligations are
met completely are recognized when earned.

Royalty revenues are
recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in
licensed territories as provided by the licensee and are recognized in the
period the sales occur. Differences between actual royalty revenues and
estimated royalty revenues, which have not historically been significant, are
reconciled and adjusted for in the quarter they become known.

Research and Development Expenses

All research and
development expenses, including amounts funded by research and development
collaborations, are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses are
comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities,
including salaries and benefits; stock-based compensation expense; laboratory
supplies; contract services, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical
development costs; expenses associated with the commercial supply investment in
telaprevir (due to telaprevir’s stage of development); and infrastructure
costs, including facilities costs and depreciation. When third-party service
providers’ billing terms do not coincide with our period-end, we are required to
make estimates of the costs, including clinical trial costs, contract services
and investment in commercial supply, incurred in a given accounting period and
record accruals at period-end. We base our estimates on our knowledge of the
research and development programs, services performed for the period, past
history for related activities and the expected duration of the third-party
service contract, where applicable.

Restructuring Expense

We record liabilities associated with restructuring
activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are
incurred, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities” (“FAS 146”). The liability for accrued restructuring expense
of $33.1

million at December 31, 2006 is
related to that portion of our


facility in Kendall Square,
Cambridge, Massachusetts that we are not occupying and do not intend to occupy.
This liability is calculated by applying our best estimate of our net ongoing
obligation. As prescribed by FAS 146, we use a probability-weighted
discounted cash-flow analysis to calculate the amount of this liability. The
probability-weighted discounted cash-flow analysis is based on management’s
assumptions and estimates of our ongoing lease obligations, including
contractual rental commitments, build-out commitments and building operating
costs, and estimates of income from subleases, based on the term and timing of
such subleases. We discount the estimated cash flows using a discount rate of
approximately 10%. These cash flow estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted
in subsequent periods. Adjustments are based, among other things, on management’s
assessment of changes in factors underlying the estimates. Because our estimate
of the liability includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the
time-value of money, the estimate will increase simply as a result of the
passage of time, even if all other factors remain unchanged.

Our estimates of our
restructuring liability have changed in the past, and it is possible that our
assumptions and estimates will change in the future, resulting in additional
adjustments to the amount of the estimated liability. The effect of any such
adjustments could be material. For example, we currently have two subleases for
portions of the Kendall Square

f

acility with remaining terms of five and
six years, respectively, and we have made certain estimates and assumptions
relating to future sublease terms following the expiration of the current
subleases. Market variability may require adjustments to those assumptions in
the future. We will review our assumptions and judgments related to the lease
restructuring on at least a quarterly basis until the Kendall Square lease is
terminated or expires, and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary,
based on our best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances.

Stock-based Compensation Expense

We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards Board No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”),
on January 1, 2006. FAS 123(R) requires us to measure
compensation cost of stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the
fair value of the award, including estimated forfeitures, and to recognize that
cost as an expense ratably over the employee’s requisite service period
(generally the vesting period of the equity award). Prior to January 1,
2006, we accounted for stock-based compensation to employees in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees” (“APB 25”), and related interpretations. We also followed the
disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“FAS 123”). We elected to adopt
the modified prospective transition method as provided by FAS 123(R) and
accordingly, financial statement amounts for the periods prior to January 1,
2006 that are presented in this Form 10-K have not been restated to
reflect the fair value method.

Under FAS 123(R), we
determine the fair value of awarded stock options and shares issued under the employee
stock purchase plan using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes
valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates
concerning our stock price volatility, the rate of return of risk-free
investments, the expected term of the awards, and our anticipated dividends. In
determining the amount of expense to be recorded, we also are required to
exercise judgment to estimate forfeiture rates for awards, based on the
probability that employees will complete the required service period. If actual
forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates, our results could be
materially affected.

Altus Investment

In 2004 and 2005, we
assessed our investment in Altus Pharmaceuticals Inc., which we accounted for
using the cost method, on a quarterly basis to determine if there had been any
decrease in the estimated fair value of that investment below its $18.9 million
carrying value that might have required us to write down the cost basis of the
asset. In 2004 and 2005, we did not identify facts or circumstances that would
cause us to determine that the cost basis of our interest in Altus should have
been changed. If any adjustment to the estimated fair value of the investment
had reflected a decline in the value of the


investment
below its cost, we would have considered the evidence available to us,
including the duration and extent to which the decline was
other-than-temporary. If the decline had been considered other-than-temporary,
the cost basis of the investment would have been written down to fair value as
a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down would have been included in
the consolidated statements of operations. Altus completed an initial public
offering of its common stock in January 2006. In 2006, we sold 817,749 shares of
Altus common stock and warrants to purchase 1,962,494 shares of Altus common
stock for $30.0 million, resulting in realized net gain of $11.2 million, based
on the difference between the proceeds of the sales and the carrying value of
the asset.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared with Year
Ended December 31, 2005

Our net loss for 2006 was $206.9 million, or $1.83 per
basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss for 2005 of $203.4
million, or $2.28 per basic and diluted common share. Included in our net loss
for 2006 was stock-based compensation expense of $39.1 million, restructuring
expense of $3.7 million, loss on exchange of convertible subordinated notes of
$5.2 million, gains related to an investment of $11.2 million and the
effect of a cumulative benefit of accounting change, related to the adoption of
FAS 123(R) of $1.0 million. Included in our net loss for 2005 was stock-based
compensation expense of $4.6 million, net restructuring expense of $8.1
million and loss on exchange of convertible subordinated notes of $48.2
million.

While our net loss for
2006 increased by only $3.5 million as compared to 2005, our revenues and
expenses changed significantly period to period. In particular, our research
and development expenses increased by $123.2 million from 2005 to 2006,
including a $28.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense.
Overall, our total costs and expenses increased by $134.6 million from
2005 to 2006. These increased costs and expenses were partially offset by the $55.5 million
increase in revenues from 2005 to 2006. Our net loss per basic and diluted
common share decreased in 2006 from 2005 as a result of an increase in the
basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding from
89.2 million shares to 113.2 million shares, which offset the increase in the
net loss.

Revenues

Total revenues increased to $216.4 million in 2006
compared to $160.9 million in 2005. In 2006, revenues were comprised of $41.2
million in royalties and $175.1 million in collaborative and other research and
development revenues, as compared with $32.8 million in royalties and $128.1
million in collaborative and other research and development revenues in 2005.

Royalty revenues increased by $8.4 million, or 26%,
from 2005 to 2006. Royalties consist of Lexiva/Telzir (fosamprenavir calcium) royalty
revenues and a small amount of Agenerase (amprenavir) royalty revenues.
Fosamprenavir calcium is marketed under the trade name Lexiva in the United
States and Telzir in the European Union. Royalty revenues are based on actual
and estimated worldwide net sales of Lexiva/Telzir and Agenerase. The increase
in royalty revenues was due to the increase in Lexiva/Telzir sales. By the end
of 2005, Lexiva/Telzir had largely replaced Agenerase in worldwide markets.


Collaborative
and other research and development revenues increased $47.1 million, or 37%,
from 2005 to 2006. The table presented below is a summary of revenues from
collaborative arrangements for 2006 as compared with 2005.

In 2006, we
entered into one new major collaboration agreement, with Janssen, which
resulted in $68.0 million of revenues in 2006, including:

·

an amortized portion of the $165.0 million
up-front payment;

·

payments from Janssen to fund a portion of telaprevir
development costs; and

·

a milestone of $15.0 million.

Our
revenues from Merck increased by $34.3 million in 2006 over 2005 levels as
the result of increased revenues recognized from milestone payments offset by decreased
research funding. We recognized lower revenues from Novartis due to the
completion of our research collaboration with Novartis. Our revenues from our
GlaxoSmithKline collaboration were higher in 2005 due to our full recognition in
2005 of the $20.0 million up-front license payment paid under that
agreement.

In 2007, we expect that our
revenues from Janssen will increase significantly as a result of the
recognition over a full year of an amortized portion of the up-front payment
made to us by Janssen in 2006, a full year of telaprevir development cost
sharing under our collaboration agreement with Janssen and potentially
additional milestone payments. We expect that the increased Janssen revenues
will be partially offset by decreased revenues from Novartis and Merck as a
result of the completion of the research programs with these collaborators.
Merck is continuing to develop drug candidates identified under the
collaboration, and we may receive additional revenues in 2007 from Merck
related to milestone payments. We do not expect to receive any further revenues
from Novartis under our collaboration agreement. We expect that for the
foreseeable future the revenues and funding from collaborations that support
our development-stage compounds, such as the Janssen and Merck collaborations,
will provide a proportionately higher level of financial support for our
research and development activities than revenues and funding from research
collaboration agreements.

Costs and Expenses

Royalty Payments

Royalty payments increased
$2.1 million, or 21%, to $12.2 million in 2006 from $10.1 million in 2005.
Royalty payments relate to a royalty we pay to a third party on sales of
Lexiva/Telzir and Agenerase. The increased royalty payments relate to the
increased royalty revenues we received in 2006 as compared to 2005.

Research and
Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased $123.2
million, or 50%, to $371.7 million in 2006, including stock-based
compensation expense of $32.0 million, from $248.5 million in 2005, including
stock-based compensation of $3.6 million. The increase in research and
development expenses was primarily the result of increased development
investment to support the global Phase 2b clinical


development program for
telaprevir, as well as $27.3 million of investment in commercial supply of
telaprevir, together with a $28.4 million increase in stock-based
compensation expense. The cost of developing the commercial supply for
telaprevir is considered a research and development expense due to telaprevir’s
stage of development. Development expenses increased by $101.3 million,
accounting for 82% of the aggregate increase in research and development
expenses. Research expenses increased by $21.9 million, of which $13.9 million
was increased stock-based compensation expense.

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits, stock-based
compensation expense, laboratory supplies, contractual services (including
pharmaceutical development and clinical trial materials costs), commercial
supply investment in telaprevir, and infrastructure costs, including facilities
costs and depreciation. Set forth below is a summary that reconciles our total
research and development expenses for 2006 and 2005:

To date we have incurred in excess of $1.5 billion
in research and development costs associated with drug discovery and
development. In 2007, we expect to focus our development investment on
telaprevir, while continuing to advance the development of VX-702, VX-770,
and VX-883. We expect research and development expenses in 2007 to be
greater than in 2006 due to increased investment in clinical development, as we
advance our core programs, as well as increased costs for the investment in
commercial supply of telaprevir drug product in advance of obtaining regulatory
marketing approval. In 2007, we expect to incur research and development
expenses of approximately $110 million to $130 million for commercial
supply investment in telaprevir. We are making this investment to support a
timely commercial product launch if we are successful in completing development
of telaprevir and obtaining marketing approval. In addition, we expect that our
combined research and development expenses will increase in future periods as
we add personnel and capabilities to support the planned development of our
lead drug candidates. However, our anticipated 2007 research and development
expenses could vary materially from our projections, depending on the
occurrence and timing of clinical trials and clinical trial results.


The successful development
of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk
factors. The duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to
the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidate. The FDA and comparable
agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the
introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring
lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling
activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Data obtained from
preclinical, nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process
may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development
activity. Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying
interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The
duration and cost of discovery, preclinical studies, nonclinical studies and
clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are
difficult to predict. Therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the
ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available. The
most significant costs associated with drug discovery and development are those
costs associated with Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Given the
uncertainties related to development, we are currently unable to reliably
estimate when, if ever, our drug candidates will generate revenue and net cash
inflows.

Sales, General and
Administrative Expenses

Sales, general and
administrative expenses increased $13.9 million, or 32%, to $57.9 million in
2006 from $44.0 million in 2005. This increase is the result of increased headcount
to support our growth as we advance our drug candidates, particularly
telaprevir, into late-stage development

. We expect
that our sales, general and administration expenses in 2007 will be
significantly higher than in 2006, because we are planning to build our
capabilities in late-stage development, drug supply, registration and
commercialization of pharmaceutical products, as we advance telaprevir through
clinical development.

Restructuring
Expense

We recorded net restructuring
expense of $

3.7

million in 2006
compared to a restructuring expense of $8.1 million in 2005.

The
expense in 2006 resulted primarily from imputed interest and build-out
costs related to the restructuring liability. The expense for 2005 included a
credit against the portion of restructuring liability relating to the portion
of the Kendall Square facility that we decided in 2005 to occupy, offset by
(i) the estimated incremental net ongoing lease obligation associated with
the portion of the Kendall Square facility that we are not occupying and do not
intend to occupy and (ii) imputed interest costs relating to the
restructuring liability.

In accordance with FAS 146,
we review our estimates and assumptions with respect to the Kendall Square
lease on at least a quarterly basis, and will make whatever modifications we
believe necessary to reflect any changed circumstances, based on our best
judgment, until the termination of the lease. Our estimates have changed in the
past, and may change in the future, resulting in additional adjustments to the
estimate of liability, and the effect of any such adjustments could be
material. Because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a
discount rate to reflect the time-value of money, the estimate of the liability
will increase each quarter simply as a result of the passage of time.


Non-Operating Items

Interest income increased $11.0 million,
or 92%, to $23.0 million in 2006 from $12.0 million in 2005. The
increase was the result of higher invested funds and portfolio yields.

Interest expense decreased
$9.4 million, or 54%, to $8.0 million in 2006 from $17.3 million
in 2005, because we reduced the level of our outstanding debt in 2006 from
2005.

In 2006, we sold 817,749
shares of the common stock of Altus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for $11.7 million
and warrants to purchase 1,962,494 shares of Altus common stock for $18.3 million,
resulting in a realized gain of $11.2 million.

In addition, as a result
of the issuance during 2005 and 2006 of common stock in exchange for a portion
of our 2007 Notes and 2011 Notes, we recorded non-cash charges of $5.2
million in 2006 and $48.2 million in 2005. These charges related to the
incremental shares issued in the transactions over the number of shares that
would have been issued upon the conversion of the notes under their original
terms.

In connection with the
adoption of FAS 123(R), during 2006 we recorded a $1.0 million benefit from the
cumulative effect of changing from recording forfeitures related to restricted
stock awards as they occurred, to estimating forfeitures during the service
period.

Year Ended
December 31, 2005 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2004

Our net loss for 2005 was
$203.4 million, or $2.28 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net
loss for 2004 of $166.2 million, or $2.12 per basic and diluted common share.
Our loss in 2005 included restructuring expense of $8.1 million and a charge of
$48.2 million for the exchange of newly issued common stock for a portion of
our outstanding convertible notes. Our loss in 2004 included restructuring
expense of $17.6 million and a charge for the retirement of convertible notes
of $3.4 million.

Our net loss for 2005
increased by $37.2 million compared to 2004, and our revenues and expenses
changed significantly from period to period. Our total revenues increased by
$58.2 million from 2004 to 2005. This increase was largely offset by a
$56.4 million increase in research and development expenses. In addition,
our net loss in 2005 included a $48.2 million charge on exchange of
convertible notes for which there was no comparable charge in 2004. Our net
loss per basic and diluted share increased due to an increase in our net loss partially
offset by an increase in the basic and diluted weighted average number of
common shares outstanding from 78.6 million shares to 89.2 million shares.

Revenues

Total revenues increased
to $160.9 million in 2005 compared to $102.7 million in 2004. In 2005, revenues
were comprised of $32.8 million in royalties and $128.1 million in
collaborative and other research and development revenues, as compared with
$17.3 million in royalties and $85.4 million in collaborative and other research
and development revenues in 2004.

Royalty revenues increased
by $15.5 million, or 90%, from 2004 to 2005. Royalties consisted of
Lexiva/Telzir (fosamprenavir calcium) and Agenerase (amprenavir) royalty
revenue. The increase in royalty revenues was due to an increase in
Lexiva/Telzir sales.

Collaborative and other
research and development revenues increased $42.7 million, or 50%, in 2005 as
compared with 2004. The increase in collaborative and other research and
development revenues was due to revenues related to collaboration agreements we
entered into in 2004 and in 2005. In 2005, we entered into
collaboration agreements with Avalon Pharmaceuticals and GlaxoSmithKline. Under
these collaboration agreements, in 2005 we earned $5.0 million in up-front
license fees from Avalon and $20.0 million in up-front license fees from
GlaxoSmithKline. In 2004, we entered into collaboration agreements with CFFT, Mitsubishi
Pharma Corporation, and Merck. We received $19.5 million in 2005 from
two milestone payments made by Merck in our Aurora kinase inhibitor
collaboration. We recognized revenues of approximately $7.3 million in
2005 related to these milestones. We earned $2.5 million in 2005 in
milestone revenues from Kissei related to the completion of regulatory filings
in preparation for Phase 1 clinical development of VX-702 in Japan.
The table presented below is a summary of revenues from collaborative
arrangements for 2005 as compared with 2004.

Royalty Payments

Royalty payments increased
$4.4 million, or 79%, to $10.1 million in 2005 from $5.6 million in 2004.
Royalty payments relate to a royalty we pay to a third party on sales of
Lexiva/Telzir and Agenerase. The increased royalty payments related to the
increased royalty revenues we received in 2005 as compared to 2004.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased $56.4
million, or 29%, to $248.5 million in 2005, from $192.2 million in 2004.
The increase in research and development expenses in 2005 as compared with 2004
was primarily a result of investment in our clinical development programs for
telaprevir and VX-702. Development expenses accounted for 87%, or $48.9
million, of the aggregate increase in research and development expenses.
In 2005, we incurred costs for Phase 2-enabling activities for
telaprevir, we completed enrollment in a 315-patient Phase 2
clinical trial of VX-702 for the treatment of RA, and we continued a
Phase 2b clinical trial, referred to as the METRO trial, of merimepodib
(VX-497). We initiated the METRO trial during 2004. During 2004, we also
completed a Phase 1a trial of telaprevir, and began a Phase 1b evaluation of telaprevir
in patients with chronic HCV infection.


Research
and development expenses consisted primarily of salary and benefits (including
stock-based compensation expense), laboratory supplies, contractual services
and infrastructure costs, including facilities costs and depreciation. Set
forth below is a summary that reconciles our total research and development
expenses for 2005 and 2004:

Sales, General and Administrative Expenses

Sales, general and
administrative expenses of $44.0 million in 2005 remained consistent with 2004
expenses of $42.1 million.

Restructuring Expense

We recorded net restructuring expense of
$8.1 million in 2005 compared to $17.6 million in 2004. The net
restructuring expense in 2005 includes a $10.0 million credit to the
restructuring liability made when we decided in mid-2005 to occupy and
use a portion of the Kendall Square facility for our operations, which was
offset by (i) the estimated incremental net ongoing lease obligations
associated with the portion of the Kendall Square facility that we do not
intend to occupy and (ii) imputed interest costs relating to the
restructuring liability. The additional restructuring expense in 2004 primarily
resulted from revising our estimates and assumptions about when we would
identity and receive subtenants and imputing an interest charge for the related
restructuring liability.

Non-Operating Items

Interest income increased $1.7
million to $12.0 million in 2005 from $10.3 million in 2004. The increase was
mainly the result of higher returns on invested funds.

Interest expense decreased
$1.0 million, or 5%, to $17.3 million in 2005 from $18.3 million
in 2004 as a result of the exchange of newly issued stock for a portion of
our outstanding convertible debt in the second half of 2005.

In addition, as a result
of the issuance during 2005 of common stock in exchange for convertible
subordinated notes, we recorded a non-cash charge of $48.2 million. This
charge related to the incremental shares issued in the transactions over the
number of shares that would have been issued upon the conversion of the notes
under their original terms.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We have incurred operating
losses since our inception and historically have financed our operations
principally through public and private offerings of our equity and debt
securities, strategic collaborative agreements that include research and/or
development funding, development milestones and royalties on the sales of
products, investment income and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our
employee benefit programs.

At
December 31, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
of $761.8 million, which was an increase of $354.2 million from
$407.5 million at December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily a
result of:

·

$313.7
million in net proceeds from our September 2006 public offering of common
stock;

·

$165.0
million from an up-front payment we received in connection with signing the
Janssen agreement;

·

$52.4
million from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans; and

·

$30.0
million from the sale of shares of Altus Pharmaceuticals Inc. common stock and
warrants to purchase Altus common stock.

These cash inflows were
partially offset by the significant cash expenditures we made in 2006 related
to research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative
expenses. Capital expenditures for property and equipment during 2006 were $32.4
million.

At December 31, 2006,
we had $42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Notes and $59.6
million in aggregate principal amount of the 2011 Notes outstanding. The 2007
Notes are due in September 2007 and are convertible into common stock at
the option of the holder at a price equal to $92.26 per share, subject to
adjustment under certain circumstances. In February 2007, we announced
that we will redeem our 2011 Notes on March 5, 2007. The 2011 Notes are
convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the holder at a
price equal to $14.94 per share. We expect the holders of the 2011 Notes will
elect to convert their notes into stock, in which case we will issue
approximately 4.0 million. We will be required to repay any 2011 Notes that
are not converted at the rate of $1,003.19 per $1,000 principal amount, which
includes principal and interest that will accrue to the redemption date.


In August 2006, we
exchanged approximately 4.1 million shares of newly issued common stock for
approximately $58.3 million in aggregate principal amount of then outstanding
2011 Notes, plus accrued interest. As a result of this exchange we incurred a
non-cash charge of $5.2 million, which related to the incremental shares issued
in the transaction over the number that would have been issued upon the
conversion of the notes under the original conversion terms.

Our accrued restructuring
expense of $33.1 million at December 31, 2006 relates to the portion
of the Kendall Square facility that we do not intend to occupy and includes
other lease obligations, recorded at net present value. In 2006, we made cash
payments of $21.6 million against the accrued expense and received $8.0 million
in sublease rental payments. We expect to make cash payments of approximately $21.7 million
against the accrued expense in 2007 and receive $7.5 million in sublease rental
payments. We review our estimates underlying our accrued restructuring expense
on at least a quarterly basis, and the amount of the accrued expense, and
consequently any expected future payment, could change with any change in our
estimates.

The net increase of $117.9
million in deferred revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was a
result of deferring a portion of the $165.0 million up-front license payment
from Janssen, offset by recognition of revenues in 2006 related to cash
payments received from collaborators, primarily Novartis and Merck, in previous
periods, which were deferred and recognized over our period of performance in
accordance with our revenue recognition policy.

We also achieved $57.8
million in milestones related to our collaboration agreements during 2006.
Consistent with our revenue recognition policy, we recognized $56.9 million of
this amount and have deferred recognition of the remainder, which will be
recognized over the remaining period of our performance under the collaboration
agreement.

At December 31, 2006,
we had $20.0 million in loans outstanding under the loan facility established
under our collaboration with Novartis, which is repayable, without interest, in
May 2008.

We expect to continue to
make significant investments in our pipeline, particularly in clinical trials
of telaprevir, VX-702, VX-770 and VX-883, in our effort to
prepare for potential registration, regulatory approval and commercial launch
of our existing and future drug candidates. We also expect to continue to make
a significant investment in the commercial supply of telaprevir in order to
manufacture sufficient quantities of drug product in advance of obtaining regulatory
marketing approval, to support a timely commercial product launch if we are
successful in completing the development of telaprevir and obtaining marketing
approval. We expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the
foreseeable future.

The adequacy of our
available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will
depend on many factors, including the number, breadth and prospects of our
discovery and development programs, the costs and timing of obtaining
regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates and our decisions regarding
manufacturing and commercial investments. Collaborations have been and will
continue to be an important component of our business strategy.

As part of our strategy
for managing our capital structure, we have from time to time adjusted the
amount and maturity of our debt obligations through new issues, privately
negotiated transactions and market purchases, depending on market conditions
and our perceived needs at the time. We expect to continue pursuing a general
financial strategy that may lead us to undertake one or more additional capital
transactions. Any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions
in which we have engaged in the past.

We believe that our
current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to
fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next

eighteen

months. To the extent
that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, in addition
to the above-mentioned sources, are not sufficient to fund our
activities, it will be necessary to raise additional funds through public
offerings or private placements of our securities or other methods of
financing. We also will continue to manage our capital structure and consider
all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen


our
long-term liquidity profile. There can be no assurance that any such financing
opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

CONTRACTUAL
COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS

The
first part of the following table sets forth commitments and obligations that
have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
2006. Certain other obligations and commitments, while not required under GAAP
to be included in the consolidated balance sheets, may have a material impact
on liquidity. We have presented these items, all of which we have entered into
in the ordinary course of business, in the table below in order to present a
more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity.

Commitments and Obligations Recorded on the

The collaborator
development loans in the table above represent indebtedness to Novartis in the
amount of approximately $20.0 million, which will be repayable without interest
in May 2008.

At December 31, 2006,
we had $42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 2007 Notes and $59.6
million in aggregate principal amount of 2011 Notes outstanding. In
February 2007, we announced that we will redeem our 2011 Notes on
March 5, 2007. The 2011 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder
at a price equal to $14.94 per share. The principal amount of the 2011 Notes
are shown in the preceding table as payable in 2007. However, we expect that
the entire principal amount of these notes will be converted into common stock prior
to March 5, 2007.

Additional
Commitments and Obligations Not Required to be Recorded on Consolidated Balance
Sheets at December 31, 2006

At December 31, 2006,
our future minimum commitments and contractual obligations included facilities
operating leases and contractual commitments related to our research and
development programs. These items are not required under GAAP to be recorded on
our consolidated balance sheets. They are disclosed in the table presented
above and described more fully in the following paragraphs in order to provide
a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity at
December 31, 2006.

Our future minimum
commitments under our Kendall Square lease for the period commencing
January 1, 2007, including lease payments, are $22.7 million for
2007,

$47.3

for
2008 and 2009, $47.6 million for 2010 and 2011 and $171.2 million through
the expiration of the lease in 2018. These amounts are included in the table
above. We are using for our operations approximately 40% of the Kendall Square
facility. We have entered into two subleases for the remaining rentable square
footage at the Kendall Square facility to offset our on-going contractual
lease obligations. The subleases will expire in 2011 and 2012 and contain
options to extend through 2015 and 2018, respectively. One of the subleases has
certain termination provisions beginning in 2010. The future minimum committed
income from the


subleases
is $8.2

m

illion for 2007,

$16.3

million for 2008
and 2009, $12.6 million for 2010 and 2011 and $1.7 million for years
thereafter. These amounts are not offset against our obligations set forth in
the table above. See Note E, “Restructuring” to our consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Commitments under research
and development programs represent contractual commitments entered into for
materials and services in the normal course of business.

Our table detailing
contractual commitments and obligations does not include severance pay
obligations to certain of our executive officers in the event of a
not-for-cause termination under existing employment contracts. The cash amount
for which the we might be liable upon any such termination, based on current
executive pay and bonus levels, could range from $0 to $

1.5 million.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities” (“FAS 159”). FAS 159 provides companies with
an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
The objective of FAS 159 is to reduce both complexity in accounting for
financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring
related assets and liabilities differently.

GAAP have required
different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can
create artificial volatility in earnings. The FASB has stated it believes that
FAS 159 helps to mitigate this type of accounting-induced volatility by
enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value,
which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed
rules regarding hedge accounting.

FAS 159 also
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for
similar types of assets and liabilities.

For example, FAS 159
requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors
and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of
the company’s choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires companies
to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company
has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. FAS 159
does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting
standards, including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements
included in FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”), and FASB No. 107,
“Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments.”

FAS 159 will be
effective as of the beginning of our first fiscal year beginning after
November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the
previous fiscal year provided that a company makes that choice in the first 120
days of the relevant fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of FAS 157.

In September 2006, FASB
issued FAS 157. FAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure
assets and liabilities and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair
value measures, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect
fair-value measurements have on earnings. FAS 157 does not require any new fair
value measurements. FAS 157 will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2008.
We currently are evaluating the effect of FAS 157 on our consolidated financial
statements.

In June 2006, FASB
issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure, and


transition.
FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We
currently are evaluating FIN 48 and believe the adoption of FIN 48 will not
have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2005, the FASB
issued FAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (“FAS 154”).
FAS 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” and Statement No. 3,
“Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.” FAS No. 154
requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of
changes in accounting principle, unless it is impractible to determine either
the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. We
adopted SFAS 154 beginning on January 1, 2006. Its adoption did not
have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2005,
FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments” (“FSP FAS 115-1”), which provides guidance on
determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are
considered impaired, whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, and on
measuring such impairment loss. FSP FAS 115-1 also includes
accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary
impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have
not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. FSP FAS 115-1
is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2005. We adopted FSP FAS 115-1 in the first quarter of 2006.
Adoption of FSP FAS 115-1 did not have a material effect on the our
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

ITEM

QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As part of our investment
portfolio, we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks. The
investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to
fund operations, including our research and development activities. None of
these market risk-sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes. We
do not have derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.

Interest Rate Risk

We invest our cash in a
variety of financial instruments, principally securities issued by the United States
government and its agencies, investment grade corporate bonds and notes and
money market instruments. These investments are denominated in United States
dollars. All of our interest-bearing securities are subject to interest
rate risk, and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate.
Substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of marketable securities
with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity, and
we have implemented guidelines limiting the term-to-maturity of our investment
instruments. Due to the conservative nature of these instruments, we do not
believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(1)   Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The Company’s chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c))
as of the end of the period covered by this Annual


Report on Form 10-K,
have concluded that, based on such evaluation, the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, the Company’s management recognized that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,
and the Company’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

(2)   Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

The management of the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and
Rule 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s
principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the
Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

·

pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

·

provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Company; and

·

provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, it used the
criteria set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Based on its assessment, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of December 31,
2006, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective
based on those criteria.

The assessment of the
Company’s management of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated below.

(3)   Changes in
Internal Controls.

During
the quarter ended December 31, 2006, there were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting, that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vertex
Pharmaceuticals Incorporated

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based
on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s


management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Vertex
Pharmaceuticals Incorporated maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Incorporated as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
loss, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31,
2006 of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and our report dated

February 27

,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vertex
Pharmaceuticals Incorporated

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the each of the two years in
the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated at December 31, 2006 and
2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes B and D to the consolidated
financial statements, on January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based
on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated February 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

A. The
Company

Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Incorporated (“Vertex” or the “Company”) is in the business of discovering,
developing and commercializing small molecule drugs for the treatment of
serious diseases. The Company intends to continue investing in and building
capabilities in research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical
products while it advances its drug candidates to market. Vertex earns royalty
revenues from the sale of Lexiva/Telzir (fosamprenavir calcium), an HIV protease
inhibitor for the treatment of HIV.

The Company currently is
concentrating most of its drug development resources on four drug candidates:
telaprevir (VX-950) for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection; VX-702
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases; VX-770
for the treatment of cystic fibrosis; and VX-883 for the treatment of
bacterial infection. In June 2006, the Company entered into a collaboration
agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica, N.V., a Johnson & Johnson
company, relating to telaprevir. Under the collaboration agreement, the Company
has retained exclusive commercial rights to telaprevir in North America and
will lead the development program. Janssen has agreed to be responsible for 50%
of the drug development costs under the development program for North America
and the Janssen territories. The Company’s pipeline also includes several drug
candidates that are being developed by its collaborators including Merck &
Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc and Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Vertex is subject to risks
common to companies in its industry including, but not limited to, rapid
technological change and competition, uncertain protection of proprietary
technology, the dependence on the success of the Company’s lead drug candidate telaprevir,
uncertainty about clinical trial outcomes, the need to comply with government
regulations, share price volatility, the need to obtain additional funding,
uncertainties relating to pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement, dependence
on collaborative relationships, potential product liability and limited
experience in drug development, manufacturing, and sales and marketing. The
Company expects to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future, as a
result of expenditures for its research, development and commercialization
programs.

B. Accounting
Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial
statements reflect the operations of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. The Company operates in one segment, Pharmaceuticals, and all
revenues are from United States operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reported periods. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial
statements have been made in connection with the calculation of revenues,
research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expense, investments
and restructuring expense. The Company bases its estimates on historical
experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period
in which they become known.

(Continued)

Reclassification in the Preparation of Financial
Statements

Certain amounts in prior
years’ financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current
presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the reported net loss.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist
principally of money market funds and marketable securities. The Company places
these investments with highly rated financial institutions, and, by policy,
limits the amounts of credit exposure to any one financial institution. These
amounts at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not
experienced any credit losses in these accounts and does not believe it is
exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds. The Company has no
foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other foreign exchange hedging
arrangements.

To date, the Company’s
revenues have been generated from a limited number of customers in the biotechnology
and pharmaceuticals industries in the United States, Europe and Japan. In 2006,
the Company had significant revenue transactions with Janssen, Merck and
GlaxoSmithKline that accounted for 31%, 27% and 20% respectively, of the
Company’s total revenues. In 2005, the Company had significant revenue
transactions with Novartis Pharma AG, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck that accounted
for 33%, 33% and 15% respectively, of the Company’s total revenues. In 2004,
revenue transactions with Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline accounted for 49% and
19%, respectively, of the Company’s total revenues.

Receivables from Janssen
and GlaxoSmithKline represented approximately 63% and 22%, respectively, of the
Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006. Receivables
from GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis represented approximately 46% and 22%,
respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31,
2005. Management believes that credit risks associated with these collaborators
are not significant.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at
the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist
principally of money market funds and debt securities. Changes in cash and cash
equivalents may be effected by shifts in investment portfolio maturities as
well as by actual cash receipts and disbursements.

Marketable Securities

Marketable securities consist of investments in municipal
bond securities, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. government-sponsored
enterprises securities, high-grade corporate bonds and asset-backed
securities that are classified as available-for-sale. The Company classifies
marketable securities available to fund current operations as current assets on
the consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities are classified as long-term
assets on the consolidated balance sheets if (i) they have been in an
unrealized loss position for longer than one year and (ii) the Company has
the ability and intent to hold them (a) until the carrying value is
recovered and (b) such holding period may be longer than one year.
Marketable securities are stated at fair value with their unrealized gains and
losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which
is a separate component of stockholders’ equity, until such gains and losses
are realized. The fair value of these securities is based on quoted market
prices. If a decline in the fair value is considered other-than-temporary,
based on available evidence, the unrealized loss is transferred from other
comprehensive loss to the consolidated statements of operations. There were no
write-downs of marketable securities in 2006, 2005 or 2004. Realized
gains and losses are determined on

the
specific identification method and are included in interest income in the consolidated
statements of operations.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”), as of January 1, 2006. FAS 123(R) revises
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” (“FAS 123”), supersedes Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB
25”), and amends Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement Statement
No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows” (“FAS 95”). FAS 123(R) requires
companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms
of stock-based employee compensation over the employees’ service periods.
Compensation cost is measured at the fair value of the award at the grant date,
including estimated forfeitures, and is adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures
and the outcomes of certain conditions.

In accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure” (“FAS 148”),
for periods prior to January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the
disclosure-only provisions of FAS 123 and also applied APB 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for all stock awards granted to employees. Under
APB 25, for periods prior to January 1, 2006, provided that other criteria
are met, when the exercise price of options equaled the market price of the
common stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense was recognized. Also
in accordance with APB 25 the Company was not required to record
compensation expense for shares issued under the ESPP.

Prior to
January 1, 2006 and in accordance with APB 25, the Company recorded
stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards over the
related vesting period for an amount equal to the difference between the price
per share of restricted stock issued and the fair value of the Company’s common
stock at the date of grant or issuance. The Company recorded forfeitures of
restricted stock as they occurred.

Please refer to
Note D, “Stock-based Compensation,” for further information.

Restructuring

The Company records costs
and liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities, as defined in
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 146, “Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” (“FAS 146”), at fair
value in the period the liability is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial
measurement, changes to a liability are measured using the credit-adjusted
risk-free discount rate applied in the initial period. In 2006, 2005 and 2004,
the Company recorded costs and liabilities for exit and disposal activities
related to a restructuring plan in accordance with FAS 146. The liability
is evaluated and adjusted as appropriate on at least a quarterly basis for
changes in circumstances.

Please refer to Note E,
“Restructuring,” for further information.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes
revenue in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”)
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements” (“SAB 101”), as amended by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 104, “Revenue Recognition” (“SAB 104”), and for revenue
arrangements entered into after June 30, 2003, Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”
(“EITF 00-21”).

The Company’s revenues are generated primarily through
collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. The terms
of these agreements typically include payment to Vertex of one

F-

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

B. Accounting Policies (Continued)

or more
of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees, funding of
research and/or development efforts, milestone payments and royalties on
product sales.

Agreements containing
multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain
criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone
value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of
fair value of the undelivered obligation(s). The consideration received is
allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values or the
residual method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to
each of the separate units.

The Company recognizes
revenues from non-refundable, up-front license fees on a straight-line
basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance, which is
typically the research or development term. Research and development funding is
recognized as earned, ratably over the period of effort.

Substantive
milestones realized in collaboration arrangements are recognized as earned when
the corresponding payment is reasonably assured, subject to the following
policies in those circumstances where the Company has obligations remaining
after achievement of the milestone:

·

In
those circumstances where collection of a substantive milestone is reasonably
assured, the Company has remaining obligations to perform under the
collaboration arrangement and the Company has sufficient evidence of fair value
for its remaining obligations, management considers the milestone payment and
the remaining obligations to be separate units of accounting. In these
circumstances, the Company uses the residual method under EITF 00-21 to
allocate revenue among the milestones and the remaining obligations.

·

In
those circumstances where collection of a substantive milestone is reasonably
assured, the Company has remaining obligations to perform under the
collaboration arrangement and the Company does not have sufficient evidence of
fair value for its remaining obligations, management considers the milestone
payment and the remaining obligations under the contract as a single unit of
accounting. In those circumstances where the collaboration does not require
specific deliverables at specific times or at the end of the contract term, but
rather the Company’s obligations are satisfied over a period of time,
substantive milestones are recognized over the period of performance. This
typically results in a portion of the milestone payment being recognized as
revenue on the date the milestone is achieved equal to the applicable
percentage of the performance period that has elapsed as of the date the
milestone is achieved, with the balance being deferred and recognized over the
remaining period of performance.

The Company evaluates
whether milestones are substantive at the inception of the agreement based on
the contingent nature of the milestone, specifically reviewing factors such as
the scientific and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone as
well as the level of effort and investment required. Milestones that are not
considered substantive and do not meet the separation criteria are accounted
for as license payments and recognized on a straight-line basis over the
remaining period of performance.

Payments received after
performance obligations are met completely are recognized when earned.

Royalty revenues are
recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in
licensed territories, as provided by the licensee, and are recognized in the
period the sales occur. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated
royalty revenues, which have not historically been significant, are reconciled
and adjusted for in the quarter during which they become known.

Research and Development Expenses

All research and development expenses, including
amounts funded by research collaborations, are expensed as incurred. Research
and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing

F-


VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

B. Accounting Policies (Continued)

research
and development activities, including salaries and benefits; laboratory supplies;
contract services, including clinical trial costs and pharmaceutical
development costs; stock-based compensation expense; and infrastructure costs,
including facilities costs  and
depreciation. Due to telaprevir’s stage of development, costs related to the investment
in its commercial supply are included in research and development expenses. The
Company’s collaborators have funded portions of the Company’s research and
development programs related to specific drug candidates and research targets,
including, in 2006, telaprevir, VX-702, VX-770, kinases and
certain cystic fibrosis research targets; and in 2005, telaprevir, VX-702,
kinases and certain cystic fibrosis research targets; and in 2004,
telaprevir, kinases, caspase inhibitors, and certain cystic fibrosis research
targets.

The
following table details the research and development expenses incurred by the
Company for collaborator-sponsored and Company-sponsored programs
(collaborator-sponsored programs are those in which a collaborator has funded
at least a portion of the related program expenses, such as the telaprevir
program) for 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands):

The total research and
development expenses for 2006, 2005 and 2004 includes $32.0 million, $3.6
million and $1.4 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense.

Property and
Equipment

Property and equipment are
recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization is provided using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset,
generally four to seven years for furniture and equipment and three to five
years for computers and software. Leasehold improvements are amortized using
the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the improvements
or the remaining life of the associated lease. Major additions and betterments
are capitalized; maintenance and repairs to an asset that do not improve or
extend its life are charged to operations. When assets are retired or otherwise
disposed of, the assets and related allowances for depreciation and
amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is
reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Investments

Investments include long-term investments
recorded using the cost method of accounting. When the Company holds an
ownership interest in an entity of less than 20%, and does not have the ability
to exercise significant influence over the entity’s operating activities, the
Company accounts for its investment using the cost method. If any adjustment to
the fair value of an investment reflects a decline in the value of that
investment below its cost, the Company considers the evidence available to it,
including the duration and extent to which the market value of the investment
has been less than cost, to evaluate the extent to which the decline is
other-than-temporary. If the decline is considered other-than-temporary, the
cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value as a new cost basis
and the amount of the write-down is included in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations. There were no write-downs of investments in
2006, 2005 or 2004. Please refer to Note I, “Altus Investment,” for
further information about the Company’s investment in Altus
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Income Taxes

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the income tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation
allowance is applied against any net deferred tax asset if, based on the
weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs
incurred to complete Vertex’s convertible subordinated note offerings are
deferred and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The
costs are amortized based on the effective interest method over the term of the
related debt issuance. The amortization expense is included in interest expense
on the consolidated statements of operations. Unamortized costs related to
exchanged debt is transferred from other assets to additional paid-in capital
on the consolidated balance sheets.

Stock Offering
Costs

Expenses incurred in
connection with common stock issuances are recorded as an offset to additional
paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.

Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss
consists of net loss and other comprehensive loss, which includes foreign
currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on certain
marketable securities. For purposes of comprehensive loss disclosures, the
Company does not record tax provisions or benefits for the net changes in
foreign currency translation adjustment, as the Company intends to permanently
reinvest undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiary.

Foreign Currency
Translation

The functional currency of
the Company’s foreign subsidiary is the local currency. Assets and liabilities
of the foreign subsidiary are re-measured into U.S. dollars at rates of
exchange in effect at the end of the year. Revenue and expense amounts are
re-measured using the average exchange rates for the period. Net unrealized
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are included in
other comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of stockholders’
equity. Included in other comprehensive loss is a net unrealized gain related
to foreign currency translation of $189,000 at December 31, 2006, a net
unrealized loss related to foreign currency translation of $18,000 at
December 31, 2005 and a net unrealized gain related to foreign currency
translation of $613,000 at December 31, 2004.

Basic and Diluted
Net Loss per Common Share

Basic net loss per share
is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period, excluding restricted stock that has been issued but is not yet
vested. Diluted net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period plus additional weighted average
common equivalent shares outstanding during the period when the effect is
dilutive. Common equivalent shares result from the exercise of outstanding
stock options (the proceeds of

F-

which are then assumed to have been used to repurchase
outstanding stock using the treasury stock method), the assumed conversion of
convertible notes and the vesting of unvested restricted shares of common stock.
Common equivalent shares have not been included in the net loss per share
calculations because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Total
potential gross common equivalent shares consisted of the following (in

New Accounting
Pronouncements

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement No. 159, “The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“FAS
159”).  FAS 159 provides companies with
an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair
value.  The objective of FAS 159 is
to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the
volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities
differently.

Generally accepted accounting principles have required
different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can
create artificial volatility in earnings. 
FASB has indicated it believes that FAS 159 helps to mitigate this
type of accounting-induced volatility by enabling companies to report related
assets and liabilities at fair value, which would likely reduce the need for
companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting.

FAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure
requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose
different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities.

For example, FAS 159 requires companies to provide
additional information that will help investors and other users of financial
statements to more easily understand the effect of the company’s choice to use
fair value on its earnings. It also requires entities to display the fair value
of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair
value on the face of the balance sheet.  FAS 159
does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting
standards, including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements
included in FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair
Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”), and FASB Statement No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments.”

FAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a
company’s first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007.  Early adoption is permitted as of the
beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the company makes that
choice in the first 120 days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the
provisions of FAS  157.

In September 2006, FASB issued FAS 157. FAS
157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities
and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value measures, the
information used to measure fair value, and the effect fair-value measurements
have on earnings. FAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. FAS
157 will be effective for the Company beginning

Accounting Policies (Continued)

January 1, 2008. The
Company is currently evaluating the effect of FAS 157 on its consolidated
financial statements.

In June 2006, FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides
guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating
FIN 48 and believes the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material effect on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2005,
FASB issued Statement No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections
(“FAS 154”).” FAS 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting
Changes” and Statement No.3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements.” FAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’
financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is
impractible to determine either the period-specific effects or the
cumulative effect of the change. The Company adopted FAS 154 beginning on
January 1, 2006. Its adoption did not have a material effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In
November 2005, FASB issued a FASB Staff Position (“FSP”)
on FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”
(“FSP FAS 115-1”), which provides guidance on determining when
investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired,
whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, and on measuring such impairment
loss. FSP FAS 115-1 also includes accounting considerations
subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and
requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been
recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. FSP FAS 115-1
is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2005. The Company adopted FSP FAS 115-1 in the first
quarter of 2006. Adoption of FSP FAS 115-1 did not have a material effect
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

C. Common and Preferred
Stock

Stock and Option Plans

At December 31, 2006,
the Company had four stock-based employee compensation plans: the 1991 Stock
Option Plan (the “1991 Plan”), the 1994 Stock and Option Plan (the “1994
Plan”), the 1996 Stock and Option Plan (the “1996 Plan”) and the 2006 Stock and
Option Plan (the “2006 Plan,” and together with the 1991 Plan, the 1994 Plan,
and the 1996 Plan, collectively, the “Stock and Option Plans”), and one
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”).

Under the 2006 Plan, the Company may issue restricted
stock and options to its employees, directors and consultants for services.
Stock options may be granted under the 2006 Plan either as options intended to
qualify as “incentive stock options” (“ISOs”) under the Internal Revenue Code
or as non-qualified stock options (“NQSOs”). Each option granted under the 2006
Plan has an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant. For options issued to current employees, the
date of grant is the date the option grant is approved by the Company’s Board
of Directors. For grants to new employees, the date of grant is the employee’s
first day of employment. The price per

F-

(Continued)

share of
restricted stock granted to employees is equal to $0.01, the par value of the
Company’s common stock. Vesting of options and restricted stock generally is
ratable over specified periods, usually four years, and is determined by the
Company’s Board of Directors. All options awarded under the 2006 Plan expire
not more than ten years from the grant date.

Stock options granted under
the 1991 Plan, the 1994 Plan and the 1996 Plan were granted either as ISOs or
NQSOs. Under the 1991 Plan, stock options could only be granted to employees
(including officers and directors who were employees) and to consultants of the
Company (NQSOs only). Under the 1994 Plan and the 1996 Plan, stock rights,
which may be (i) ISOs when Internal Revenue Code requirements are met,
(ii) NQSOs, or (iii) shares of common stock or the opportunity to
make a direct purchase of shares of common stock, could be granted to employees
(including officers and directors who are employees) and consultants, advisors
and non-employee directors (NQSOs and stock awards only). Under the 1991 Plan
and the 1994 Plan, ISOs could only be granted at a price not less than the fair
market value of the common stock on the date of the grant, and NQSOs could be
granted at an exercise price established by the Board of Directors, which could
have been less than, equal to or greater than the fair value of the common
stock on the date of the grant. Stock options granted under the 1996 Plan could
not have been granted at a price less than the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of grant. Vesting is ratable over specified periods for all
plans, is generally four or five years, and was determined by the Board of
Directors. ISOs granted under the 1991 Plan, the 1994 Plan and the 1996 Plan
must expire not more than ten years from the date of grant.

The ESPP permits eligible employees to enroll in a
twelve-month offering period comprising two six-month purchase periods.
Participants may purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, through payroll
deductions, at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common
stock on the first day of the applicable twelve-month offering period, or the
last day of the applicable six-month purchase period, whichever is lower.
Purchase dates under the ESPP occur on or about May 14 and
November 14 of each year.

The Company reserved an
aggregate of  8,000,000 shares under the
1991 Plan and 1994 Plan. The Company reserved 22,000,000 shares under the 1996
Plan and 7,302,380 shares under the 2006 Plan. At December 31, 2006, the
Company had approximately 14,279,000 stock options outstanding and
approximately 1,764,000 outstanding and unvested restricted shares. At
December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately 5,807,000 shares of
common stock available for grants under the 2006 Plan, and no shares were
available for grants under the 1991 Plan, the 1994 Plan or the 1996 Plan. As of
December 31, 2006, approximately 507,000 shares remained available for
future purchases under the ESPP and approximately 179,000 shares remained
available for grant under the 401(k) Plan.

Rights

Each Vertex shareholder also holds one share purchase
right (a “Right”) for each share of common stock owned. Each Right entitles the
holder to purchase from the Company one half of one-hundredth of a share of
Series A junior participating preferred stock, $0.01 par value (the
“Junior Preferred Shares”), of the Company at a price of $135 per one half of
one-hundredth of a Junior Preferred Share, subject to adjustment (the “Purchase
Price”). The Rights are not exercisable until after the acquisition by a person
or group of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock (an “Acquiring
Person”), or after the announcement of an intention to make or the commencement
of a tender offer or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in
the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding
common stock (the earlier of such dates being called the “Distribution Date”).
Until the

F-

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

C. Common
and Preferred Stock (Continued)

Distribution Date (or
earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the Rights will be traded
with, and only with, the common stock. Until a Right is exercised, the Right
will not entitle the holder thereof to any rights as a stockholder.

If any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person,
each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring
Person, will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise and payment of
the Purchase Price that number of shares of common stock having a market value
of two times the Purchase Price and, if the Company is acquired in a business
combination transaction or 50% or more of its assets are sold, each holder of a
Right will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise and payment of
the Purchase Price that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring
company that at the time of the transaction will have a market value of two
times the Purchase Price.

At any time after any person becomes an acquiring
person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of
the outstanding common stock, the Board of Directors of the Company may cause
the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group) to be exchanged,
in whole or in part, for common stock or Junior Preferred Shares, at an
exchange rate of one share of common stock per Right or one half of
one-hundredth of a Junior Preferred Share per Right.

At any time prior to the acquisition by a person or
group of beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock,
the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights at a price of $0.01
per Right.

The Rights have certain
anti-takeover effects, in that they will cause substantial dilution to a
person or group that attempts to acquire a significant interest in Vertex on
terms not approved by the Board of Directors.

D. Stock-based
Compensation

For the twelve
months ended December 31, 2006

On January 1, 2006, Vertex adopted FAS 123(R),
using the modified prospective method, pursuant to which the Company applies
the provisions of FAS 123(R) to its consolidated financial statements on a
going-forward basis. The modified prospective transition method requires the
application of the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, the first
day of Vertex’s 2006 fiscal year. Prior periods have not been restated. FAS
123(R) requires companies to recognize share-based payments to employees
as compensation expense using the “fair value” method. Under the fair value
recognition provisions of FAS 123(R), stock-based compensation cost,
measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, is recognized
as expense ratably over the service period, which generally is the vesting
period of the award. The fair value of stock options and shares purchased pursuant
to the ESPP is calculated using the Black- Scholes valuation model. The fair
value of restricted stock is based on intrinsic value on the date of grant. The
expense recognized over the service period includes an estimate of awards that
will be forfeited. Prior to adoption of FAS 123(R), Vertex recorded the impact
of forfeitures of restricted stock as they occurred. In connection with the
adoption of FAS 123(R) during 2006, Vertex recorded a $1.0 million benefit
from the cumulative effect of changing from recording forfeitures related to
restricted stock awards as they occurred to estimating forfeitures during the
service period.

Stock-based compensation expense recognized during
2006 includes: (a) stock option and restricted stock awards granted after
December 31, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value, and ESPP awards
with the offering periods commencing May 15, 2006 and November 15,
2006, in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123(R); (b) stock option
and restricted stock awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of

based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions
of FAS 123; and (c) ESPP awards with offering periods commencing
May 15, 2005 and November 15, 2005, based on the grant-date fair
value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123. Stock-based
compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006
reflects estimated forfeitures of awards.

The estimated fair value of Vertex’s stock-based
awards, less estimated forfeitures, is amortized on a ratable basis over the
awards’ service periods. No equity compensation cost was capitalized during the
year ended December 31, 2006.

The effect of recording
stock-based compensation in 2006 was as follows (in thousands):

·

net

·

basic diluted net loss per

Stock Options

All options granted during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company’s
common stock on the date of grant and the options had weighted average grant
date fair values, measured on the grant date, of $20.08, $7.11 and $5.00,
respectively.

In accordance with FAS 123(R), the Company recorded
stock-based compensation expense of $29.8 million in 2006 related to stock
options. As of December 31, 2006, there was $51.9 million of total
unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to
unvested options granted under the Stock and Option Plans. That cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.59 years.

F-

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

D.
Stock-based Compensation (Continued)

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to
estimate the fair value of stock options at the grant date. The Black-Scholes
valuation model uses the option exercise price as well as estimates and
assumptions related to the expected price volatility of the Company’s stock,
the period during which the options will be outstanding, the rate of return on
risk-free investments, and the expected dividend yield for the Company’s stock
to estimate the fair value of a stock option on the grant date. The Company
validates its estimates and assumptions through consultations with independent
third parties having relevant expertise.

The fair value of each
option granted under the Stock and Option Plans during 2006 was estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions:


Expected stock
  price volatility

57.10

%

Risk-free
  interest rate

4.74

%

Expected term

5.64 years

Expected annual
  dividends

—

The weighted-average
valuation assumptions were determined as follows:

·

Expected stock price volatility

:   In 2006, the Company
changed its method of estimating expected volatility from relying exclusively
on historical volatility to relying exclusively on implied volatility. Options
to purchase the Company’s stock with remaining terms of greater than one year
are regularly traded in the market. Expected stock price volatility is
calculated using the trailing one month average of daily implied volatilities
prior to grant date.

·

Risk-free interest rate

:   The Company bases the
risk-free interest rate on the interest rate payable on U.S. Treasury
securities in effect at the time of grant for a period that is commensurate
with the assumed expected option term.

·

Expected term of options

:   The expected term of options
represents the period of time options are expected to be outstanding. The
Company uses historical data to estimate employee exercise and post-vest
termination behavior. The Company believes that all groups of employees exhibit
similar exercise and post-vest termination behavior and therefore does not
stratify employees into multiple groups in determining the expected term of
options.

·

Expected annual dividends

:   The estimate for annual
dividends is $0.00, because the Company has not historically paid, and does not
intend for the foreseeable future to pay, a dividend.

The total intrinsic value (the amount by which the
fair market value exceeded the exercise price) of stock options exercised
during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $63.4 million, $18.4 million and $2.3 million,
respectively. The total cash received from employees as a result of employee

the fourth quarter of 2005 and the second quarter of 2006 is based on implied
volatility. The expected term represents purchases and purchase periods that
take place within the offering period. The Company bases the risk-free interest
rate on the interest rate payable on U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the
time of grant for a period that is commensurate with the assumed expected term.
The expected annual dividends estimate is $0.00, because the Company has not
historically paid, and does not for the foreseeable future intend to pay, a
dividend.

For Periods Prior

In accordance with FAS 148, for periods prior to

Stock-based Compensation (Continued)

for all stock awards
granted to employees. Under APB 25, provided that other criteria were met, when
the exercise price of stock options granted to employees equaled the market
price of the common stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense was
recognized. Additionally, under APB 25, the Company was not required to record
compensation expense for the cost of options or shares issued under the ESPP.
Accordingly, no expense related to options or ESPP shares was recorded prior to
January 1, 2006,

except for $0.2
million in stock-based compensation expense in 2005 related to the acceleration
of options in accordance with one executive’s severance agreement.

Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company recorded stock-based
compensation expense related to restricted stock awards over the related
vesting period for an amount equal to the difference between the price per
share of restricted stock issued and the fair value of the Company’s common
stock at the date of grant or issuance. Prior to January 1, 2006, the
Company recorded forfeitures of restricted stock as they occurred

E. Restructuring

On June 10, 2003, Vertex adopted a plan to
restructure its operations to coincide with its increasing internal emphasis on
advancing drug candidates through clinical development to commercialization.
The restructuring was designed to re-balance the Company’s relative investments
in research and development to better support the Company’s long-term strategy.
The restructuring plan included a workforce reduction, write-offs of certain
assets and a decision not to occupy approximately 290,000 square feet of
specialized laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts under lease
to Vertex (the “Kendall Square Lease”). The Kendall Square Lease commenced in
January 2003 and has a 15-year term. In the second quarter of 2005,
the Company revised its assessment of its real estate requirements and decided
to use approximately 120,000 square feet of the facility subject to the Kendall
Square Lease (the “Kendall Square Facility”) for its operations, beginning in
2006. The Company is now occupying this portion of the Kendall Square Facility.
The remaining rentable square footage of the Kendall Square Facility currently
is subleased to third parties.

In accordance with FAS 146, the Company’s initial
estimate of its liability for net ongoing costs associated with the Kendall
Square Lease obligation was recorded in the second quarter of 2003 at fair
value. The restructuring expense incurred from the second quarter of 2003
through the end of the first quarter of 2005 (i.e., immediately prior to the
Company’s decision to use a portion of the Kendall Square Facility for its
operations) relates to the estimated incremental net ongoing lease obligations
associated with the entire Kendall Square Facility, together with imputed
interest costs relating to the restructuring liability. The restructuring
expense incurred in the period beginning in the second quarter of 2005
continues to be estimated in accordance with FAS 146, but relates only to the
portion of the building that the Company currently does not intend to occupy
for its operations. The remaining lease obligations, which are associated with
the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that the Company occupies and uses
for its operations, are recorded as rental expense in the period incurred. The
Company reviews its assumptions and estimates quarterly and updates its
estimates of this liability as changes in circumstances require. As required by
FAS 146, the expense and liability recorded is calculated using probability- weighted
discounted cash-flows of the Company’s estimated ongoing lease obligations,
including contractual rental and build-out commitments, net of estimated
sublease rentals, offset by related sublease costs.

In estimating the expense and liability under its
Kendall Square Lease obligation, the Company estimated (i) the costs to be
incurred to satisfy rental and build-out commitments under the lease (including
operating costs), (ii) the lead-time necessary to sublease the space,
(iii) the projected sublease rental rates, and (iv) the anticipated
durations of subleases. The Company validates its estimates and assumptions
through consultations with independent third parties having relevant expertise.
The Company

F-


VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

E.
Restructuring

(Continued)

uses a credit-adjusted
risk-free rate of approximately 10% to discount the estimated cash flows. The
Company will review its estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly
basis, until the termination of the Kendall Square Lease, and will make
whatever modifications management believes necessary, based on the Company’s
best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances. The Company’s estimates
have changed in the past, and may change in the future, resulting in additional
adjustments to the estimate of liability, and the effect of any such
adjustments could be material. Because the Company’s estimate of the liability
includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time-value of money,
the estimate of the liability will increase each quarter simply as a result of
the passage of time. Changes to the Company’s estimate of the liability are
recorded as additional restructuring expense/(credit).

The restructuring accrual of $33.1 million at
December 31, 2006 relates solely to the portion of the Kendall Square
Facility that the Company does not intend to use for its operations and
includes other lease obligations, recorded at net present value. The Company
classified $4.7 million of the total amount at December 31, 2006 as short-term,
and $28.3 million as long-term. The short-term portion of the restructuring
liability represents the net amount the Company expects to pay in 2007.

In 2006, the Company recorded net restructuring
expense of $3.7 million, which was primarily attributable to imputed interest
and to build-out costs relating to the restructuring liability.

In
2005, the Company recorded net restructuring expense of $8.1 million. This
net expense includes a $10.0 million credit to the restructuring liability
made when the Company decided to occupy and use a portion of the Kendall Square
Facility, which was offset by (i) the estimated incremental net ongoing
lease obligations associated with the portion of the Kendall Square Facility
that the Company does not intend to occupy and (ii) imputed interest costs
relating to the restructuring liability. The portion of the $18.2 million
additional charge in 2005 that was for incremental lease obligations was
related to the revision of certain key estimates and assumptions about operating
costs, including real estate taxes associated with the portion of the Kendall
Square Facility that the Company does not intend to occupy.  Activity with respect to the restructuring liability

Marketable Securities (Continued)

The Company reviews
investments in marketable securities for other-than-temporary impairment
whenever the fair value of an investment is less than amortized cost and
evidence indicates that an investment’s carrying amount is not recoverable
within a reasonable period of time. To determine whether an impairment is
other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the ability and
intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers
whether the evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable
outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment
includes reasons for the impairment, compliance with the Company’s investment
policy, the severity and the duration of the impairment and changes in value
subsequent to year end. The following table summarizes the fair value and gross
unrealized losses related to marketable securities, aggregated by investment
category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous
unrealized loss position as of December 31, (in thousands):

F. Marketable Securities
(Continued)

Unrealized losses in the
portfolio relate to various debt securities including U.S. government
securities, U.S. government-sponsored enterprise securities, corporate debt
securities and asset-backed securities. For these securities, the unrealized
losses are primarily due to increases in interest rates. The investments held
by the Company are high investment grade and there were no adverse credit
events. Because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these
investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company
does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Gross realized gains and
losses for 2006 were $

4,000
and $88,000 respectively.
Gross realized gains and losses for 2005 were $15,000 and $75,000,
respectively. Gross realized gains and losses for 2004 were $628,000 and
$205,000, respectively.

I. Altus Investment

Altus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Altus”) completed
an initial public offering in January 2006. As of the completion of the
offering, Vertex owned 817,749 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase
1,962,494 shares of common stock (the “Altus Warrants”). In addition, the
Company, as of the completion

F-

I. Altus
Investment

(Continued)

of the offering, held
450,000 shares of redeemable preferred stock, which are not convertible into
common stock and which are redeemable for $10.00 per share plus annual dividends
of $0.50 per share, which have been accruing since the redeemable preferred stock
was issued in 1999, at Vertex’s option on or after December 31, 2010, or
by Altus at any time. The Company was restricted from trading Altus securities
for a period of six months following the initial public offering.

When the Altus securities trading restrictions
expired, the Company sold the 817,749 shares of Altus common stock for approximately
$11.7 million, resulting in a realized gain of approximately $7.7 million in
August 2006. Additionally when the restrictions expired, the Company began
accounting for the Altus Warrants as derivative instruments under the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. FAS 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS 133”). In accordance with FAS 133,
in the third quarter of 2006, the Company recorded the Altus Warrants on its consolidated
balance sheet at a fair market value of $19.1 million and recorded an
unrealized gain on the fair market value of the Altus Warrants of
$4.3 million. In the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company sold the Altus Warrants
for approximately $18.3 million, resulting in a realized loss of
$0.7 million. As a result of the Company’s sales of Altus common stock and
Altus Warrrants in 2006, the Company recorded a realized gain on a sale of investment
of $11.2 million.

In accordance with the
Company’s policy, as outlined in Note B, “Accounting Policies,” the
Company assessed its investment in Altus, which it accounts for using the cost
method, and determined that there had not been any adjustments to the fair
values of that investment that would require the Company to write down the
investment basis of the asset, in 2005 and 2006. The Company’s cost basis
carrying value in its outstanding equity and warrants of Altus was $18.9
million at December 31, 2005.

L. Convertible
Subordinated Notes

On February 13, 2004,
the Company issued approximately $153.1 million in aggregate principal
amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due in February 2011
(the “February 2011 Notes”) in exchange for an equal principal amount of
its outstanding 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due in September 2007
(the “2007 Notes”). On September 17, 2004, the Company issued
approximately $79.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible
Senior Subordinated Notes due in February 2011 (the “September 2011
Notes”) in exchange for an equal principal amount of its 2007 Notes. The terms
of the September 2011 Notes are identical to those of the
February 2011 Notes (the February 2011 Notes and the
September 2011 Notes are referred to together as the “2011 Notes”).

The 2011 Notes are
convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a price equal to
$14.94 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2011
Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.75% per annum, and the Company is required
to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of
the 2011 Notes on February 15 and August 15 of each year. On or after
February 15, 2007, the Company may redeem the 2011 Notes at a redemption
price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
The deferred issuance costs associated with the issuance of the 2011 Notes,
which are classified as long-term other assets, were approximately
$3.0 million for the February 2011 Notes and $1.9 million for
the September 2011 Notes.

The 2007 Notes are
convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a price equal to
$92.26 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2007
Notes bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum, and the Company is required to
make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the
2007 Notes on March 19 and September 19 of each year. The 2007 Notes
are redeemable by the Company at any time at specific redemption prices if the
closing price of the

F-


VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

L.
Convertible Subordinated Notes

(Continued)

Company’s common stock
exceeds 120% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a
period of 30 consecutive trading days. The deferred issuance costs associated
with the original sale of the 2007 Notes were $9.3 million. Payment in
full of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on these 2007 Notes is
due in September 2007.

As a result of the 2004 exchanges of the 2007 Notes
for 2011 Notes, the Company recorded a charge in the amount of $2.5 million
on the retirement in February 2004 of $153.1 million in aggregate
principal amount of the 2007 Notes, and a charge in the amount of
$1.0 million on the retirement in September 2004 of
$79.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Notes. These
charges represent that portion of the unamortized deferred issuance costs
applicable to the amount of 2007 Notes retired.

In September 2005, the Company exchanged
approximately 2.5 million shares of newly issued common stock for
approximately $40.5 million in aggregate principal amount of then
outstanding 2007 Notes, plus accrued interest. As a result of the exchange, the
Company incurred a non-cash charge of $36.3 million in 2005. This charge
is related to the incremental shares issued in the transaction over the number
that would have been issued upon conversion of the 2007 Notes under their
original terms, at the original conversion price of $92.26.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company exchanged
approximately 8.1 million shares of newly issued common stock for
approximately $114.5 million in aggregate principal amount of then
outstanding 2011 Notes, plus accrued interest. As a result of the exchange, the
Company incurred a non-cash charge of $11.9 million in 2005. This charge
is related to the incremental shares issued in the transaction over the number
that would have been issued upon conversion of the 2011 Notes under their
original terms, at the original conversion price of $14.94.

In the third quarter of 2006, the Company exchanged
approximately 4.1 million shares of newly issued common stock for approximately
$58.3 million in aggregate principal amount of then outstanding 2011 Notes plus
accrued interest. As a result of this exchange, the Company incurred a non-cash
charge of $5.2 million in 2006. This charge is related to the incremental
shares issued in the transaction over the number that would have been issued
upon the conversion of the 2011 Notes under their original terms, at the
original conversion price of $14.94.

The following items related to the 2005 and 2006 exchanges
were recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated
balance sheets: accrued interest, remaining unamortized issuance costs of the
exchanged notes and issuance costs of the common stock.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, $0.5
million was amortized to interest expense for the issuance costs of the
remaining 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes. For the year ended December 31,
2005, $1.0 million was amortized to interest expense for the issuance
costs of the remaining 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, $1.3 million was amortized to interest expense for
the issuance costs of the 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes.

At December 31, 2006, there was approximately
$42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Notes and approximately
$59.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2011 Notes outstanding. At
December 31, 2006, the 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes had fair values of $

41.3

million
and $

150.1

million,
respectively, as obtained from a quoted market source.

In February 2007, the
Company announced that it will redeem the 2011 notes on March 5, 2007. If the
holders of the 2011 Notes all elect to convert their 2011 Notes into common
stock at the conversion price of $14.94 per share, the Company will be required
to issue approximately 4.0 million shares of the

F-


VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Company’s
common stock in full satisfaction of the 2011 Notes. If the holders of the 2011
Notes do not elect to convert their 2011 Notes into common stock, the Company
will be required to redeem the 2011 Notes at a redemption price of $1,003.19
per $1,000 principal amount, which includes principal and unpaid interest that
will accrue through the redemption date.

M. Equity Offering

In September 2006,
the Company completed a public offering of 10,000,000 shares of common stock,
including the underwriters’ over-allotment of 900,000 shares, at a price
of $33.00 per share. This transaction resulted in net proceeds of approximately
$313.7 million to the Company.

In June 2005, the
Company completed a public offering of 13,512,500 shares of common stock,
including the underwriters’ over-allotment of 1,762,500 shares, at a price of
$13.00 per share. This transaction resulted in net proceeds of approximately
$165.4 million to the Company.

N. Income Taxes

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004, there is no provision for income taxes included in the
consolidated statements of operations.

The Company’s federal statutory income tax rate for
2006, 2005, and 2004 was 34%. The Company has incurred losses from operations
but has not recorded an income tax benefit for 2006, 2005 and 2004, as the
Company has recorded a valuation allowance against its net operating losses and
other net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to the realizability
of these tax assets.

The
difference between the Company’s “expected” tax provision (benefit), as
computed by applying the U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 34% to (loss)
before provision for income taxes, and actual tax is reconciled as follows (in
thousands):

For federal income tax purposes, as of
December 31, 2006, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $1,257.2 million, and $29.7 million of tax credits, which may be
used to offset future federal income and tax liability, respectively. For state
income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $826.5 million, and $15.5 million of tax credits, which may be
used to offset future state income and tax liability, respectively. These
operating loss carryforwards began to expire in 2005, and the tax credit
carryforwards began to expire in 2004. After consideration of all the evidence,
both positive and negative, management has established a valuation allowance for
the full amount of the 2006 net deferred tax asset since it is more likely than
not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized.

As discussed in Note D “Stock-based Compensation,” the
Company adopted FAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006 for stock-based compensation
plans. Generally, tax return deductions are allowable on such arrangements,
but, may arise in different amounts and periods from when compensation costs
are recognized in the financial statements. Pursuant to FAS 123(R), if the tax
return deduction for an award exceeds the cumulative compensation expense
recognized in the financial statements, any excess tax benefit shall be
recognized as additional paid-in capital when the deduction reduces income tax
payable. Prior to adoption, the Company recognized deferred tax assets, along
with an offsetting valuation allowance, for net operating loss carryforwards that
included deductions for excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. On
adoption, the Company has chosen to derecognize the deferred tax asset for
these excess tax deduction in the net operating loss carryforwards, along with
the offsetting valuation allowance, adjusting the prior year footnote
information accordingly. The net tax amount of the unrealized excess tax
benefits as of December 31, 2006, no longer included and disclosed as a
deferred tax asset, is approximately $111.7 million. The gross amount of
this excess tax deduction in the net operating loss carryforward is
approximately $284.0 million.

The valuation allowance increased by $93.4 million
during 2006 due primarily to the increase in net operating losses from
operations and tax credits.

Ownership changes, as
defined by Internal Revenue Code, may limit the amount of net operating losses
and research and experimentation credit carryforwards that can be utilized
annually to offset future taxable income and taxes payable.

O. Significant Revenue
Arrangements

The Company has formed
strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and other organizations
in the areas of drug discovery, development, and commercialization. Research,
development and commercialization agreements provide the Company with financial
support and other valuable resources for its research programs, for the
development of clinical drug candidates, and for the marketing and sales of
products.

Collaborative
Research, Development and Commercialization Agreements

In the Company’s collaborative research, development
and commercialization programs the Company seeks to discover, develop and
commercialize pharmaceutical products in conjunction with and supported by the
Company’s collaborators. Collaborative research and development arrangements
may provide research funding over an initial contract period with renewal and
termination options that vary by agreement. The agreements may also include non-refundable,
up-front license fees as well as milestone payments based on the achievement of
a pre-agreed objective or the occurrence of a designated event. The agreements
may also contain development expense reimbursement provisions, royalty rights
or profit sharing rights, and manufacturing options. The Company has entered
into significant research and development collaborations under terms that vary
from agreement to agreement.

Janssen
Pharmaceutica, N.V.

In June 2006, the Company entered into a
collaboration agreement with Janssen for the development, manufacture and
commercialization of telaprevir, the Company’s investigative HCV protease
inhibitor. Under the agreement, Janssen has agreed to be responsible for 50% of
the drug development costs incurred under the development program for the
parties’ territories (North America for the Company, and the rest of the world,
other than the Far East, for Janssen) and has exclusive rights to commercialize
telaprevir in its territories including Europe, South America, the Middle East,
Africa and Australia. Janssen made a $165 million up-front license payment
to the Company in July 2006. Janssen has agreed to make additional
contingent milestone payments, which could total up to $380 million if
telaprevir is successfully developed, approved and launched. The agreement also
provides the Company with royalties on any sales of telaprevir in the Janssen
territories, with a tiered royalty averaging in the mid-20% range, as a
percentage of net sales in the Janssen territories, depending upon successful
commercialization of telaprevir. Each of the parties will be responsible for
drug supply in their respective territories. However, the agreement provides
for the purchase by Janssen from the Company of materials required for
Janssen’s manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. In addition,
Janssen will be responsible for certain third-party royalties on net sales in
its territories. Janssen may terminate the agreement without cause at any time
upon six months’ notice to the Company.

During 2006, the Company
recognized $68.0 million in revenue under the Janssen agreement, which includes
an amortized portion of the upfront payment, a milestone achievement of $15.0
million based on interim results of the Company’s first Phase 2b clinical trial
of telaprevir, and funding of reimbursable drug development costs.

GlaxoSmithKline plc

In December 1993, the Company and GlaxoSmithKline
entered into a collaboration agreement to research, develop and commercialize
HIV protease inhibitors, including Agenerase (amprenavir), Lexiva/Telzir
(fosamprenavir calcium) and brecanavir (VX-385). Under the collaboration
agreement, GlaxoSmithKline agreed to pay the Company an up-front license
payment, product research funding, development and commercialization milestone
payments and royalty payments on sales of drugs developed under the
collaboration.

The Company began earning a royalty from
GlaxoSmithKline in 1999 on sales of Agenerase, in the fourth quarter of 2003 on
sales of Lexiva, and in the third quarter of 2004 on sales of Telzir. In the
fourth quarter of 2004, GlaxoSmithKline paid the Company a milestone payment of
$1 million based on the initiation of Phase 2 clinical trials for
brecanavir. In the third quarter of 2004, GlaxoSmithKline paid the Company a
milestone payment of $1.5 million in connection with the regulatory
approval of Telzir in the European Union.

On December 15, 2006, GlaxoSmithKline formally
notified the Company that it would discontinue clinical development of
brecanavir (VX-385), which had advanced to Phase 2 clinical trials.
Currently, there are no drug candidates being developed under this collaboration
and the Company does not anticipate any additional research funding or milestone
payments under this collaboration. Under the original agreement,
GlaxoSmithKline had exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Vertex’s HIV
protease inhibitors in all parts of the world except the Far East. In 2003, the
Company amended the agreement to add the Far East to GlaxoSmithKline’s
territory for development and commercialization of Lexiva/Telzir. The Company
has retained certain bulk drug manufacturing rights and certain product
educational rights in territories licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. GlaxoSmithKline
has the right to terminate its arrangement with the Company without cause upon
twelve months’ notice. Termination of the agreement by GlaxoSmithKline will
relieve it of its obligation to make further payments to the Company and will
end any license granted to GlaxoSmithKline by Vertex under the agreement.

In June 1996, the Company and GlaxoSmithKline
obtained a worldwide, non-exclusive license under certain G.D.
Searle & Co. (“Searle,” now owned by Pharmacia/Pfizer) patents in the
area of HIV protease inhibition. The Company pays Searle a royalty based on
sales of Agenerase and Lexiva/Telzir.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, GlaxoSmithKline and the
Company entered into a collaborative agreement to develop and commercialize
VX-409 and certain back-up compounds, which are being investigated for the
treatment of pain. Under the terms of the agreement, GlaxoSmithKline has the
exclusive right and license to develop and commercialize VX-409 and certain
back-up compounds worldwide. Vertex received a $20 million up-front
license payment and could receive up to $385 million in additional development
and commercial milestone payments assuming the development of VX-409 and
back-up compounds in major pharmaceutical markets across a range of
indications. GlaxoSmithKline will also pay Vertex royalties on annual net sales
of any drugs commercialized under the agreement.

Revenues and royalties
earned from GlaxoSmithKline under both agreements were $43.6 million, $52.8 million
and $19.8 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Merck &
Co., Inc.

In June 2004,
Vertex entered into a global collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc.
to develop and commercialize MK-0457 (VX-680), Vertex’s lead Aurora kinase
inhibitor, and additional follow-on compound(s), for the treatment of cancer.
The Merck collaboration agreement provided for an up-front

F-

(Continued)

license payment of $20 million, which was made in
June 2004, and for research funding of $14 million over two years,
ending in June 2006. In 2006, the Company agreed with Merck to extend
the research program term and corresponding research funding for the parties’
ongoing research collaboration for an additional three months beyond the
original research program termination date. Vertex could also receive as much
as $350 million in milestone payments, including up to $130 million
for the successful development of MK-0457 (VX-680) in the first oncology
indication and additional milestone payments for development of MK-0457 (VX-680)
and follow-on compounds in other major oncology indications. In 2005, Merck
selected MK-6592 (VX-667), a follow-on compound, for development. Merck is
responsible for worldwide clinical development and commercialization of MK-0457
(VX-680) and MK-6592 (VX-667), and any other Aurora kinase inhibitors
discovered during the research program and has agreed to pay Vertex royalties
on product sales. Merck may terminate the agreement without cause at any time
upon 90 days’ advance written notice, except that six months’ advance
written notice is required at any time when a product has marketing approval in
a major market and the termination is not the result of a safety issue. In
2005, Vertex received two milestone payments from Merck totaling $19.5 million.
In 2006, Vertex received three additional milestone payments from Merck
totaling $36.3 million. Vertex recognized $58.7 million, $24.4 million
and $8.4 million of revenue related to research support, milestone
payments and the up-front license payment for this collaboration in 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated

In May 2004, Vertex entered into an agreement
with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated (“CFFT”) that provided
funding through December 31, 2005 for Vertex’s late-stage cystic fibrosis
drug discovery effort. In 2006, Vertex amended its agreement with CFFT to
extend the term of the drug discovery effort to March 31, 2008 and to
include additional development stage funding for specified VX-770 development
activities through the end of 2007. The agreement, as amended, provides that
CFFT will pay up to $32.4 million to Vertex for research and development
activities. Under the amended agreement, Vertex retains the right to develop
and commercialize VX-770 and any other compounds discovered in the research
collaboration, and will pay royalties to CFFT on net sales of any drug candidate
approved and commercialized under the collaboration.

In 2006, 2005 and 2004,
Vertex recognized $12.6 million, $14.5 million and
$6.8 million, respectively, in revenue related to its agreement with CFFT.
During the first quarter of 2004, under an earlier agreement, Vertex earned
revenue of $1.9 million. CFFT has the right to terminate the agreement
without cause, effective June 30, 2007, upon 60 days’ prior written
notice.

Novartis Pharma AG

In May 2000,
the Company entered into an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to collaborate on
the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule drugs
directed at protein kinases. The agreement was amended in February 2004.
Under the original agreement, the Company was responsible for drug discovery
and clinical proof-of-concept testing of all drug candidates. Novartis agreed
to pay the Company up to $200 million in research funding through
April 2006, and to loan the Company up to $200 million on a
non-interest-bearing basis to support clinical proof-of-concept studies.
Development loans with respect to any drug candidates accepted by Novartis for
development would be forgiven. Under the amended agreement, Vertex continued to
receive research funding through April 2006 along with development milestone
payments and royalties with respect to drug candidates selected by Novartis for
development. Novartis held an option to develop drug candidates meeting certain
pre-agreed criteria. Restrictions under the original agreement that limited
Novartis’ right to pursue kinase research and

F-

(Continued)

development outside the
collaboration were removed, and the development loan facility was terminated. Following
completion of the research term, Novartis’ development option with respect to all
compounds discovered in the research program, none of which were then in
development by Novartis, had expired. Vertex retains all rights to those
candidates, as well as to all of the intellectual property it generated under
the collaboration.

In November 2004, Novartis accepted VX-322 for
preclinical development and made a $10 million milestone payment to Vertex
that was recognized as revenue over the term of the contract. Novartis had
exclusive worldwide development, manufacturing and commercialization rights to
VX-322. That compound is no longer in development by Novartis, and Novartis’s
worldwide development, manufacturing and commercialization rights to VX-322 have
terminated.

In June 2004, the Company exercised its option
under the amended agreement to develop MK-0457 (VX-680), and the Aurora kinases
it targets, outside the Novartis collaboration and repaid approximately
$12.5 million of unspent and uncommitted development loans previously
advanced on account of MK-0457 (VX-680).

In 2006, 2005 and 2004,
the Company recognized approximately $17.6
million, $53.1 million and
$50.5 million, respectively, in revenue under this agreement. At
December 31, 2006, there were approximately $20.0 million in
remaining loans outstanding under the loan facility. These loans are repayable,
without interest, in May 2008.

Mitsubishi Pharma
Corporation

In June 2004, Vertex
entered into a collaboration agreement with Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation,
pursuant to which Mitsubishi agreed to provide financial and other support for
the development and commercialization of telaprevir. Under the terms of the
agreement, Mitsubishi has the right to develop and commercialize telaprevir in
Japan and certain other Far East countries. The agreement provides for up to
$33 million in payments by Mitsubishi to Vertex through Phase 2
clinical development, including an up-front license fee, development stage
milestone payments and reimbursement of certain drug development costs for
telaprevir. Further cost sharing beyond Phase 2 clinical development will be
determined by Mitsubishi and Vertex based on the design of registration studies
for telaprevir. The agreement also provides Vertex with royalties on any sales
of telaprevir in the Mitsubishi territory. Mitsubishi may terminate the
agreement at any time without cause upon 60 days’ prior written notice. In
the fourth quarter of 2004, Mitsubishi paid the Company a milestone payment of
$4.0 million for first dosing of telaprevir in a patient in the Phase 1b
clinical trial in the United States. In the third quarter of 2006, Mitsubishi
paid the Company a milestone payment of $3.0 million for the first dosing
of telaprevir in a patient by Mitsubishi in the Mitsubishi territory. Vertex
recognized $8.6 million, $3.4 million and $5.8 million in revenue under
this agreement in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The revenue includes an
amortized portion of the up-front payment, milestone achievements, and
reimbursement of certain of Vertex’s expenses incurred in telaprevir
development.

Kissei
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

The Company and
Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Kissei”) are parties to an agreement to
collaborate on the identification of inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase and the
development of those compounds as novel, orally active drugs for the treatment
of inflammatory and neurological diseases. Under the terms of the agreement,
Kissei agreed to pay the Company up to $22 million comprised of a
$4 million up-front license payment, $11 million of product
research funding over three years and

F-


VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED

O. Significant Revenue Arrangements
(Continued)

$7 million of development and commercialization
milestone payments. Additionally, Kissei agreed to reimburse the Company for
certain development costs, including a portion of costs for Phase 2 trials of
VX-702. Research funding ended under this program in June 2000, and the
Company has received the full amount of research funding specified under the
agreement. Kissei has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize VX-702
in Japan and certain Far East countries and co-exclusive rights in China,
Taiwan and South Korea. The Company retains exclusive marketing rights outside
the Far East and co-exclusive rights in China, Taiwan and South Korea. In
addition, the Company will have the right to supply bulk drug material to
Kissei for sale in its territory and will receive royalties or drug supply
payments on future product sales, if any. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, approximately
$6.4 million, $7.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively, was recognized
as revenue under this agreement. The $7.3 million of revenue recognized in
2005 includes a $2.5 million milestone paid upon Kissei’s completion of
regulatory filings in preparation for Phase 1 clinical development of VX-702 in
Japan.

P. Employee Benefits

The Company has a
401(k) retirement plan (the “Vertex 401(k) Plan”) in which
substantially all of its permanent employees are eligible to participate.
Participants may contribute up to 60% of their annual compensation to the
Vertex 401(k) Plan, subject to statutory limitations. The Company may
declare discretionary matching contributions to the Vertex 401(k) Plan
that are payable in the form of Vertex common stock. The match is paid in the
form of fully vested interests in a Vertex common stock fund. Employees have
the ability to transfer funds from the Company stock fund as they choose. The
Company declared matching contributions to the Vertex 401(k) Plan as

Q. Related Party
Transactions

As of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
Company had a loan outstanding to a former officer of the Company in the amount
of $36,000, $36,000, $97,000, respectively, which was initially advanced in
April 2002. The loan balance is included in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheets.

In 2001, the Company
entered into a four year consulting agreement with a director of the Company
for the provision of part-time consulting services over a period of four years,
at the rate of $80,000 per year commencing in January 2002. The consulting
agreement terminated in January 2006.

R. Contingencies

The Company has certain
contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business
activities. The Company accrues a reserve for contingent liabilities when it is
probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be
reasonably estimated.

F-


VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

S. Guarantees

As permitted under Massachusetts law, Vertex’s
Articles of Organization and Bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify
certain of its officers and directors for certain claims asserted against them
in connection with their service as an officer or director. The maximum
potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make
under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. However, the Company has
purchased directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies that could reduce
its monetary exposure and enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts
paid. No indemnification claims are currently outstanding and the Company
believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is
minimal.

Vertex customarily agrees in the ordinary course of
its business to indemnification provisions in agreements with clinical trials
investigators and sites in its drug development programs, in sponsored research
agreements with academic and not-for-profit institutions, in various comparable
agreements involving parties performing services for the Company in the
ordinary course of business, and in its real estate leases. The Company also
customarily agrees to certain indemnification provisions in its drug discovery
and development collaboration agreements. With respect to the Company’s
clinical trials and sponsored research agreements, these indemnification
provisions typically apply to any claim asserted against the investigator or
the investigator’s institution relating to personal injury or property damage,
violations of law or certain breaches of the Company’s contractual obligations
arising out of the research or clinical testing of the Company’s compounds or
drug candidates. With respect to lease agreements, the indemnification
provisions typically apply to claims asserted against the landlord relating to
personal injury or property damage caused by the Company, to violations of law
by the Company or to certain breaches of the Company’s contractual obligations.
The indemnification provisions appearing in the Company’s collaboration
agreements are similar, but in addition provide some limited indemnification
for its collaborator in the event of third party claims alleging infringement
of intellectual property rights. In each of the cases above, the
indemnification obligation generally survives the termination of the agreement
for some extended period, although the obligation typically has the most
relevance during the contract term and for a short period of time thereafter.
The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be
required to make under these provisions is generally unlimited. The Company has
purchased insurance policies covering personal injury, property damage and
general liability that reduce its exposure for indemnification and would enable
it in many cases to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company
has never paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits or settle claims related
to these indemnification provisions. Accordingly, the Company believes the
estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal.

In March 2003, the Company sold certain assets of
PanVera LLC to Invitrogen Corporation for approximately $97 million. In
December 2003, the Company sold certain instrumentation assets to Aurora
Discovery, Inc. for approximately $4.3 million. The agreements with
the buyers each require the Company to indemnify the buyer against any loss it
may suffer by reason of Vertex’s breach of certain representations and
warranties, or failure to perform certain covenants, contained in such
agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the
agreements are of a type customary in agreements of this sort. The Company’s
aggregate obligations under the indemnity contained in each agreement are, with
a few exceptions which the Company believes are not material, capped at
one-half of the applicable purchase price, and apply to claims under
representations and warranties made within fifteen months after closing (which
period has ended) although there is no corresponding time limit for claims made
based on breaches of covenants. Neither Invitrogen or Aurora has made any
claims to date under the applicable indemnities, and the Company believes that
the estimated fair value of the remaining indemnification obligations is
minimal.

On February 10, 2004, Vertex entered into a
Dealer Manager Agreement with UBS Securities LLC in connection with the
exchange of approximately $153.1 million of the February 2011 Notes
for approximately $153.1 million of 2007 Notes. On September 13,
2004, the Company entered into a second Dealer Manager Agreement with UBS
Securities in connection with the exchange of approximately $79.3 million
of the September 2011 Notes for approximately $79.3 million of 2007
Notes. Each of the Dealer Manager Agreements requires the Company to indemnify
UBS Securities against any loss UBS Securities may suffer by reason of the
Company’s breach of representations and warranties relating to the exchanges of
the convertible notes, the Company’s failure to perform certain covenants in
those agreements, the inclusion of any untrue statement of material fact in the
disclosure materials provided to potential investors in the 2011 Notes, the
omission of any material fact needed to make those materials not misleading, and
any actions taken by the Company or its representatives in connection with the
exchanges. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Dealer Manager
Agreements are of a type customary in agreements of this sort. The Company
believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is
minimal.

On June 7, 2005 and September 14, 2006, the
Company entered into Purchase Agreements with Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as the representative of the several
underwriters named in such agreements, relating to the public offering and sale
of shares of the Company’s common stock. The Purchase Agreement relating to
each offering requires the Company to indemnify the underwriters against any
loss they may suffer by reason of the Company’s breach of representations and
warranties relating to that public offering, the Company’s failure to perform
certain covenants in those agreements, the inclusion of any untrue statement of
material fact in the prospectus used in connection with that offering, the
omission of any material fact needed to make those materials not misleading,
and any actions taken by the Company or its representatives in connection with
the offering. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Purchase Agreement
are of a type customary in agreements of this sort. The Company believes the
estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal.
