PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

We are a biotechnology company in the business of discovering, developing and commercializing small molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases. We
continue to make progress toward our goal of becoming a profitable pharmaceutical company with industry-leading capabilities in research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products.
We intend to continue investing in and building these capabilities as we advance our product candidates to market. Our corporate purpose, which we use to guide our activities and which we believe is
an important component of our past and future success, is to innovate to redefine health and transform lives with new medicines.

We
have a number of drug candidates in development, including compounds targeting hepatitis C virus ("HCV") infection, rheumatoid arthritis ("RA"), cystic fibrosis,
cancer, pain and HIV infection. Our corporate strategy is to retain principal responsibility for the development and commercialization of some of our proprietary drug candidates in certain
major markets, concentrating a significant part of our overall development and commercialization resources on those drug candidates once we select them. We intend to rely on collaborators to conduct
development and commercialization of certain of our other drug candidates either worldwide or in markets upon which we are not currently focused. We are concentrating most of our drug development
resources at the present time on three compounds: VX-950 for the treatment of chronic HCV infection, VX-702 for the treatment of RA and VX-770 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.

Collaborations
will continue to be a key component of our corporate strategy. We currently are collaborating with GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck & Co., Inc., Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated, Novartis Pharma AG, Mitsubishi Pharma Corp., Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and other companies. Collaborations provide us with
financial support and other valuable resources for our research programs, development resources for our clinical drug candidates and marketing and sales support for our products and product
candidates. We have a collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline that has resulted in our two marketed products to date, the HIV protease inhibitor Agenerase and its prodrug Lexiva/Telzir,
and the development of a third HIV protease inhibitor, brecanavir (VX-385), which is completing Phase IIb development as an FDA "Fast Track" designee. Through our collaborations with Novartis,
Merck and Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., four Vertex-discovered compounds are in development for the treatment of cancer. Our two Far East collaborators, Mitsubishi and Kissei, are committing
resources to develop VX-950 and VX-702, respectively, in the Far East, and providing financial support for our efforts in the rest of the world. VX-409, for pain, is being developed by GlaxoSmithKline
through our worldwide collaboration relating to certain sub-type selective sodium channel modulators.

We
plan to continue adding promising potential products to our development pipeline through our ongoing commitment to discovery research. Our drug design approach integrates biology,
chemistry, biophysics, automation and information technologies intended to make the drug discovery process efficient and productive. Our drug discovery expertise is a principal factor in the creation
of our pipeline, which includes a number of potentially breakthrough compounds. In addition to our efforts to research and develop kinase inhibitors, we currently are conducting a research program in
the area of ion channel modulation. We expect that future development candidates from our programs will be focused on a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including cancer, cystic fibrosis and
pain.

We
also will seek to opportunistically license and acquire technologies, resources and products that have the potential to strengthen our drug discovery platform, product pipeline and
commercial capabilities.

Vertex-Led Programs

Principal Areas of Focus

VX-950 (oral hepatitis C protease inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C viral infection)

VX-950 is Vertex's lead oral hepatitis C protease inhibitor, and one of the most advanced of a new class of antiviral treatments in development
targeting HCV infection. VX-950 is designed to inhibit NS3-4A serine protease, an enzyme thought to be necessary for HCV replication. The FDA has granted
"Fast-Track" designation to VX-950, because chronic HCV infection is a serious and life-threatening disease and VX-950 has the potential to shorten the
duration of therapy compared to the current standard of care. Treatment with VX-950 could result in improved sustained virologic response rates and a more favorable adverse event profile. Vertex
currently is conducting a broad Phase II development program to determine the safety and antiviral activity of VX-950.

Background: Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection

HCV infection causes chronic inflammation in the liver. The World Health Organization estimates that there are as many as 170 million people chronically
infected with HCV worldwide and that an additional 3 million to 4 million people are infected each year. Chronic HCV infection results in liver cirrhosis in 10% to 20% of patients, and
1% to 5% of chronic HCV patients worldwide develop liver cancer over a period of 20 to 30 years. Reports published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease have estimated that
approximately 3.4 million Americans are chronically infected with HCV, and the American Liver Foundation estimates that 10,000 to 12,000 Americans die as a result of HCV infection each year.

Currently,
there is no vaccine available to prevent HCV infection. The current standard treatment for HCV infection is a combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin administered
for up to 48 weeks. This treatment regimen is associated with significant side effects, including fatigue, flu-like symptoms, depression and anemia. Among patients who begin
treatment, approximately 50% of patients infected with genotype 1 HCV, the most common HCV genotype in the United States, fail to either complete treatment or show a long-term
sustained response to therapy. As a result, new safe and effective treatment options for HCV infection are needed. We believe that therapeutics that directly target viral replication, such as
VX-950, may significantly increase the number of patients who achieve a sustained viral response to drug therapy.

VX-950 Development Program

In early 2006, we obtained preliminary results from the first Phase II clinical trial of VX-950. This 28-day trial enrolled 12
treatment-naïve patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. The patients' distribution of baseline plasma HCV RNA values upon entering the trial was typical for a
treatment-naïve patient population. At the end of treatment, HCV RNA was undetectable in all 12 patients. There were no treatment discontinuations, no serious adverse events reported
and no evidence of viral breakthrough during treatment. A detailed safety analysis is ongoing.

Patients
in the Phase II trial received VX-950 in a tablet formulation at a dose of 750 mg every eight hours for 28 days in combination with standard doses of
Pegasys® (pegylated interferon alfa-2a) ("peg-IFN") and Copegus® (ribavirin) ("RBV"). At the end of 28 days, patients completed dosing with
VX-950 and, as required by the trial protocol, continued treatment with peg-IFN and RBV. This 28-day, Phase II trial was not designed to evaluate sustained viral
responses in patients receiving VX-950.

Preliminary
results from the trial are as follows:

•

At
the end of week 1 (day 8 of VX-950 dosing), plasma HCV RNA was below the limit of quantitation (< 30 IU/mL, as measured by the Roche
TaqMan® assay) in 6 of 12 patients and undetectable (< 10 IU/mL, Roche TaqMan® assay) in 2 of 12 patients.

•

At
the end of week 2, plasma HCV RNA was below the limit of quantitation in 11 of 12 patients and undetectable in 3 of 12 patients.


•

At
the end of week 3, plasma HCV RNA was below the limit of quantitation in 12 of the 12 patients and undetectable in 9 of 12 patients.

•

At
the end of VX-950 dosing (end of week 4; day 28), plasma HCV RNA was undetectable in all 12 patients.

We
have completed three-month animal toxicology studies of VX-950 that we believe will support clinical trials of VX-950 of up to three months' duration. We submitted data
from these toxicology studies and the 28-day Phase II clinical trial to the FDA in the first quarter of 2006. Subject to FDA agreement, we plan to initiate a three-month Phase II trial
of VX-950 in more than 200 HCV patients in the second quarter of 2006. We expect that this trial will include a comparison to the current standard of care in HCV therapy. We also plan to
initiate additional trials of VX-950 throughout 2006, including a Phase II trial in patients who have failed prior therapy.

The
28-day Phase II trial was the third in a series of clinical trials of VX-950 in HCV-infected patients designed to evaluate safety,
pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity, in order to guide the design of larger, longer-duration Phase II trials. The first two such trials were Phase Ib trials conducted in 2005—a trial
of VX-950 as monotherapy completed early in the year (the "Phase Ib monotherapy trial"), and a trial of VX-950 dosed together with peg-IFN completed later in the
year (the "Phase Ib combination therapy trial").

The
Phase Ib monotherapy trial enrolled 34 patients with chronic genotype 1 HCV infection who were treated for 14 days with placebo or one of three dose regimens of
VX-950. In the trial, VX-950 was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations reported, and demonstrated potent antiviral activity. Patients
treated with 750 mg of VX-950 every eight hours achieved a median 4.4log


(equivalent to 25,000-fold) reduction in plasma HCV RNA at the end of 14 days of
treatment. A median reduction in HCV RNA of greater than 2log


was seen in each of the other two VX-950 dose groups at the end of 14 days of treatment. Every patient
receiving VX-950 achieved greater than a 2log


reduction in HCV RNA within the first three days of treatment.

At
the end of 14 days of treatment in the Phase Ib monotherapy trial, plasma HCV RNA was below the limit of quantitation in four of eight patients in the 750 mg dose group and was
undetectable in two of those four patients. Higher ranges of VX-950 blood concentrations were associated in the Phase Ib monotherapy trial with higher HCV RNA reductions to the
responses established at lower blood concentrations of VX-950.

Elevated
ALT levels are common in HCV patients and are considered to be a marker of liver injury due to HCV infection. Median serum ALT declines of 25 to 32 U/L were observed in all
VX-950 dose groups in the Phase Ib monotherapy trial. In the placebo group, a median 8 U/L increase was observed. Prior to treatment with VX-950, serum ALT levels were elevated in
approximately 70% of patients in the trial. In the VX-950 dose groups, 83% (15 of 18) of patients with elevated ALT levels at baseline (prior to treatment) had achieved
normalization of ALT levels at day 14, compared to zero in the six patient placebo group. Mean levels of serum neopterin also were observed to decrease with VX-950 treatment in the trial.
Decreased neopterin levels may be a further signal of a reduction in liver inflammation associated with HCV infection.

Researchers
analyzed the sequences of the HCV NS3-4A protease gene in samples isolated from trial patients prior to and following treatment with VX-950 in the Phase Ib
monotherapy trial, in order to characterize HCV protease variants that may emerge during treatment with a direct-acting antiviral compound such as VX-950. In the group of patients that
demonstrated continued viral decline during treatment, virus could first be isolated in a sequencing assay within 7 to 10 days after completion of treatment. In this group,
wild-type virus predominated during the post-treatment period. Some variants were detected that displayed a minimally-reduced sensitivity to VX-950

in vitro

. In the other groups of patients who received
VX-950, genetic sequence changes associated with reduced sensitivity to VX-950

in vitro

were detected at the end of dosing, including some variants with moderately to highly reduced sensitivity to
VX-950. However, these
changes in gene sequences also appeared to result in reduced viral fitness. In particular, the frequency of the variant with the highest level of reduced drug sensitivity, A156V/T, diminished markedly
between the end-of-dosing and post-treatment analysis, indicating


significantly
reduced

in vivo

fitness relative to wild-type virus. Published

in vitro

data
suggest that the A156V/T variant also may retain sensitivity to interferon. We believe that these results provide a strong rationale for study of the combination of VX-950 and interferon
to achieve optimal response rates.

Later
in 2005, we conducted the Phase Ib combination therapy trial, a 14-day, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
pharmacodynamics of VX-950 when combined with peg-IFN. The antiviral activity of the combination through 14 days was significantly greater in this trial than the
activity of VX-950 administered as a single agent, and was much greater than peg-IFN alone. In addition, VX-950 appeared to be well-tolerated when dosed
alone and in combination with peg-IFN. All patients completed dosing and no serious adverse events were reported.

The
Phase Ib combination therapy trial enrolled 20 treatment-naïve patients infected with chronic genotype 1 HCV. Patients were randomized to three treatment groups: those
who received a tablet formulation of VX-950 at a dose of 750 mg every eight hours in combination with a standard dose of peg-IFN (n=8), those who received the same dose of
VX-950 administered alone (n=8) and those who received a standard dose of peg-IFN alone (n=4). The median viral load for all patients at the beginning of the trial was
6.65log


IU/mL HCV RNA (approximately 4,400,000 IU/mL). In this trial, the combination of VX-950 and peg-IFN produced an initial median reduction in plasma HCV RNA
of more than 3log


in the first two days of treatment, followed by continued decline to a median 5.5log


reduction in plasma HCV RNA at day 14, which equates to a
300,000-fold reduction in viral levels. Six of eight patients receiving the combination of VX-950 and peg-IFN achieved plasma HCV RNA levels below the limit of
quantitation at 14 days, and plasma HCV RNA levels were undetectable in four of those six patients. Adverse events in the patients receiving VX-950 alone were reported as mild, with
one incident of skin itching of moderate severity. Typical interferon-related side effects, of mild to moderate severity, were reported in the patients that received peg-IFN along with
VX-950 or placebo. The only clinically significant laboratory finding of abnormality was a finding of neutropenia (a blood disorder which can arise as a side effect of certain drug
treatments) in one patient who received peg-IFN plus placebo. Neutropenia has previously been reported in patients receiving peg-IFN. Complete data from the trial will be
presented at a medical conference later this year.

We
have conducted viral kinetic analyses of the results in both the Phase Ib monotherapy trial and the Phase Ib combination therapy trial. In these analyses we have
estimated the viral decline that might be expected, with dosing beyond 14 days, in patients who achieved HCV RNA levels below the limit of quantitation at the end of dosing. The results of this
simulation suggest that it may be possible to achieve sustained virologic response by including VX-950 in a treatment regimen of approximately 12 weeks' duration. We plan to test this
hypothesis in future clinical trials.

In
November 2004, we completed a Phase Ia clinical trial of VX-950 in healthy volunteers designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in
escalating, single doses of VX-950 ranging from 25 mg to 1250 mg. In this trial, no dose-limiting toxicities were identified, and blood serum levels of VX-950 were
observed that are associated with potent antiviral activity in laboratory experiments. In preclinical trials VX-950 showed potent and sustained anti-HCV activity in both an

in vitro

replicon system and
in infectious viral assays.

We
hold worldwide marketing rights to VX-950, except for Japan and certain Far East countries, where we are collaborating with Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation. We may consider
entering into a collaborative arrangement for the development and/or commercialization of VX-950 outside North America and the Mitsubishi territory. VX-950 was discovered in
our collaboration, now ended, with Eli Lilly and Company. We hold worldwide rights to all other second-generation HCV protease inhibitors discovered by us during our collaboration with Eli Lilly. We
will owe Eli Lilly royalties on any future sales of VX-950 and certain other HCV protease inhibitors.

VX-702 (oral p38 MAP kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis)

VX-702 is our lead oral p38 mitogen-activated protein ("MAP") kinase inhibitor, which we are currently developing for the treatment of RA. Based on
clinical trials and non-clinical studies, we


believe
that VX-702 may be a potent therapy in an inflammatory disorder such as RA. We currently are conducting a broad Phase II development program to assess the safety and efficacy of
VX-702. Our collaborator, Kissei Pharmaceuticals, currently is conducting a Phase I clinical trial of VX-702 in Japan. In our recently concluded three-month Phase II trial of
VX-702 in RA patients, VX-702 was well-tolerated through 12 weeks of dosing, and demonstrated statistically significant clinical effects on signs and symptoms of
RA. The preliminary results from this trial support our plans to advance our clinical program for VX-702 and to initiate by mid-2006 clinical studies of VX-702 on a
background of methotrexate, a commonly used therapy for RA. We expect to file an IND application with the FDA in 2006 to support clinical trials of VX-702 in the United States.

Background

Rheumatoid Arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis, a systemic disease, is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. RA has a prevalence of about 1% of the worldwide population and an
annual incidence of 3 cases per 10,000 adults. RA causes pain, swelling and loss of function in affected joints. The disease is often accompanied by significant morbidity and mortality. Depending on
the severity of the disease, the risk of disability can be as high as 33%, and mortality can be raised by as much as 52%. Patients with RA also have a significant impairment in their quality of life.

The
current standard treatment for RA is administration of a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug ("DMARD"), most commonly methotrexate. Over the last few years, there has been a rapid
increase in the use of injectable anti-tumor necrosis factor ("TNF") agents such as Remicade® (infliximab) and Enbrel® (etanercept), generally on a background of methotrexate,
when disease activity is not controlled by DMARDs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We believe
that an oral agent that successfully targets TNF production may provide an attractive treatment option for patients with this debilitating disease.

p38 MAP Kinase Inhibitors for Inflammatory Diseases

The MAP kinases are a family of structurally-related human enzymes involved in intracellular signaling pathways that enable cells to respond to their environment.
The p38 MAP kinase is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the onset and progression of inflammation. When activated, the p38 MAP kinase triggers production of multiple cytokines,
including interleukin-1 ("IL-1"), TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 ("IL-6"). Excess levels of IL-1 and TNF-alpha are associated with
a broad range of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.

We
have extensive preclinical and clinical experience with p38 MAP kinase inhibitors, which we believe may be a powerful and broadly useful new class of oral anti-inflammatory drugs.

VX-702 Development Program

In March 2006, we obtained preliminary results from our three-month Phase II 315-patient trial of VX-702 (the "VeRA" trial). A
total of 278 patients completed 12 weeks of treatment in this double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled trial. The trial was conducted at more than 40 centers in Eastern and Central Europe.
Patients received either 5 mg or 10 mg of VX-702 once daily, or placebo. In addition to VX-702, patients could receive certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic
drugs (DMARDs), but could not receive methotrexate or anti-TNF therapies. At the end of 12 weeks, patients completed dosing with VX-702 and were evaluated for improvement in
clinical signs and symptoms according to American College of Rheumatology ("ACR") criteria ("ACR


"). ACR


is a standardized measure based on a patient's attainment of at
least a 20% improvement in ACR-specified indicators of RA activity.

VX-702
met its primary objectives in the VeRA study. Preliminary analyses indicate that treatment with VX-702 in the VeRA trial led to a dose-dependent,
statistically significant increase in week 12 ACR


response rates, the primary endpoint of the clinical trial. Thirty percent of patients receiving placebo, 38% of patients receiving 5 mg
daily of VX-702 and 40% of patients receiving 10 mg daily of


VX-702
achieved an ACR


response at week 12 (p=0.04; Jonckheere-Terpstra test for increasing dose-response). In addition, 32% of placebo patients, 41% of 5 mg
VX-702-treated patients and 44% of 10 mg VX-702-treated patients achieved a EULAR (moderate or good) response (p=0.01). Dose-dependent
statistically significant effects also were seen on tender joint counts (p=0.007), swollen joint counts (p=0.003), disease activity score (DAS28; p=0.02) and morning stiffness (p=0.03). We currently
are conducting ongoing analyses of additional clinical measures and biomarkers.

Clinical
trials of a number of other p38 MAP kinase inhibitors have demonstrated dose-dependent elevations in liver enzymes, which generally are thought to be markers for
liver injury. In 2004, we completed a 28-day study of VX-702 in healthy volunteers designed specifically to evaluate the effect of VX-702 on liver enzymes. This
trial showed some transient elevations in liver enzymes in a small number of subjects. However, the magnitude of those enzyme elevations did not reach clinical significance and did not require
discontinuation of dosing. The enzyme levels returned to normal during continued dosing. In the VeRA trial, no clinically significant adverse effects were seen in liver function tests.

Also
in 2004, we completed a Phase IIa double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation clinical trial of VX-702 for the treatment of patients with
acute coronary syndrome ("ACS") undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ("PCI"), such as stent placement. p38 MAP kinase regulates the production of key inflammatory cytokines implicated in the
pathogenesis of ACS. This Phase IIa trial of VX-702 was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VX-702 in 45 unstable angina patients with
elevated c-reactive protein ("CRP") levels, a marker of inflammation measured in the blood, undergoing PCI. In this Phase IIa ACS trial, there were no clinically significant differences
between treatment and placebo groups with respect to adverse events, and VX-702 met pre-established safety and pharmacokinetic objectives. During routine
(non-continuous) electrocardiogram monitoring in the Phase IIa ACS trial, small (not clinically significant) changes in QT interval (a measure of electrical conduction within the
heart) were seen in the patients treated with VX-702. Also in the Phase IIa ACS trial, during Holter (continuous electrocardiogram) monitoring conducted for 72 hours, we
observed asymptomatic ventricular ectopy ("VE") (ventricular extra beats), which was present in all treatment groups but at a higher incidence for VX-702 treatment groups. The significance
of these events was unclear after the Phase IIa ACS trial. In the VeRA trial, we performed extensive ambulatory and 12-lead electrocardiographic monitoring on patients throughout the
trial. No differences in VE activity or cardiac arrythmias were observed between placebo and treated patients. On digital electrocardiograms, from baseline to end of treatment, a minimal (average
approximately 1.5% or less for each group) dose-dependent increase in the Fridericia rate-corrected QT interval (QTcF) was seen in the VX-702 treatment groups. No
patient experienced a clinically significant (60 msec, or approximately 15%) increase in QTcF at any time in the trial.

A
preliminary analysis of VeRA trial data also indicates that VX-702 was well-tolerated. Premature discontinuations for adverse events were low across the trial
arms: placebo (2%), 5 mg (3%) and 10 mg (5%). No clinically significant effects were seen on laboratory parameters, including liver function tests. The most common adverse events that led to treatment
discontinuation in patients receiving VX-702 were seen in two patients each and were: gastroenteritis, nausea/vomiting, rash, and renal impairment (increased serum creatinine levels to 1.2
to 1.5 times upper limit of normal). Based on preliminary analysis, the most common adverse events were generally mild or moderate and were: infection (5% of placebo patients and 10% of
VX-702 patients), gastrointestinal disorders (6% placebo and 8% VX-702), and skin disorders (0% placebo and 9% VX-702).

By
mid-2006, we expect to initiate clinical trials of VX-702 on a background of methotrexate, including a three-month dose-ranging Phase II clinical trial in more than 200
patients at centers in Europe. Doses in this planned trial will be determined based on final analysis of the VeRA trial.

We
hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to VX-702, except for Japan and certain Far East countries, where we are collaborating with Kissei Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd.


VX-770 (oral CFTR potentiator for the treatment of cystic fibrosis)

VX-770 is a small molecule compound designed to potentiate the gating activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ("CFTR") protein, a chloride ion
transporter on the cell surface that is functionally defective in patients with cystic fibrosis. We expect to file an investigational new drug ("IND") application with the FDA and initiate our first
clinical trial of VX-770 in the first half of 2006.

Cystic
fibrosis is a genetic disease afflicting approximately 30,000 people in the United States. The symptoms of cystic fibrosis, particularly the development of thick mucous that
causes lung tissue inflammation and, ultimately, irreversible lung damage, are caused by defects in the CFTR protein. A leading hypothesis is that mucous accumulates in the lung due to improper water
and salt (including chloride ion) transport across the cell surface membrane. Using our expertise in ion channels, including high-content cell assays and medicinal chemistry, we have
identified selective ion channel modulators for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. CFTR potentiator compounds such as VX-770 may work by increasing the frequency during which the CFTR channel is
open, which could result in an increase in chloride transport across the cell membrane. In laboratory studies involving bronchial epithelial cells isolated from cystic fibrosis patients, our
researchers have demonstrated that potentiator compounds may improve CFTR function.

VX-770
was discovered in our ongoing research collaboration with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ("CFFT") and with the support and participation of the Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation. We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to VX-770. We will owe CFFT royalties on any future sales of VX-770.

Other Vertex-Led Programs

VX-692 and VX-883 (gyrase inhibition for the treatment of bacterial infection)

VX-692 and VX-883 are novel, Vertex-discovered antibiotics currently in preclinical development that target both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase and
topoisomerase IV are enzymes that are essential to bacteria during the replication process. DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV inhibitors already on the market have proven to be potent, broad-spectrum
antibiotics and are used to treat a variety of common Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections in various treatment settings. While existing gyrase and
topoisomerase IV inhibitors work by interacting with the gyrA and parC subunits of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, VX-692 and VX-883 target the gyrB and parE subunits. Each of
VX-692 and VX-883 is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens prevalent in both community and hospital settings, including
certain pathogens that are less susceptible to other classes of antibiotics, such as agents targeting the other subunits of gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Accordingly, we believe that VX-692
and VX-883 warrant further investigation to determine if they may be useful in treating infections caused by drug resistant bacteria, a major and growing problem with currently marketed
antibiotics.

We
hold worldwide development and commercial rights to both VX-692 and VX-883, and we are evaluating the possibility of entering into a collaborative relationship
to advance the development of either or both of these compounds.


VX-271 (kinase inhibition for the treatment of oncology indications)

VX-271 is a novel, Vertex-discovered kinase inhibitor currently in preclinical development. Kinases have been implicated in a wide range of oncology indications,
and we believe that kinase inhibition may offer a therapeutic opportunity against a broad array of human tumors. We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to VX-271, and
we may consider entering into a collaborative arrangement to advance its development.

VX-166 (caspase inhibition for the treatment of sepsis)

VX-166 is a novel, Vertex-discovered inhibitor of multiple caspases being investigated for the treatment of sepsis and acute liver disease. Inhibition of caspases
has been shown to inhibit apoptosis. We have demonstrated in animal models that inhibition of apoptosis may be useful in the treatment of sepsis and acute liver disease. We hold worldwide rights to
VX-166, and we may consider entering into a collaborative arrangement to advance its development.

VX-765 and pralnacasan (ICE inhibition for the treatment of inflammatory diseases)

We discovered and have completed certain development activities with respect to two interleukin-1 converting enzyme ("ICE") inhibitors for the
treatment of inflammatory diseases, VX-765 and pralnacasan. ICE is an enzyme that controls the release of active IL-1

b

(one of two forms
of IL-1) and IL-18 from white blood cells into the bloodstream and within tissues. IL-1 and IL-18 are cytokines that mediate a wide range of
immune and inflammatory responses in many cell types. Elevated IL-1 and IL-18 levels have been correlated with disease states in a number of acute and chronic inflammatory
diseases.

During
2005, we completed the clinical portion of our four week, Phase IIa clinical trial of VX-765, for the treatment of psoriasis in 68 patients. We expect that data
from this trial will be reported in 2006. Earlier Phase I clinical trials of VX-765 in healthy volunteers demonstrated a
dose-dependent decrease in levels of IL-18, the first time this has been demonstrated for any therapeutic agent. Data from preclinical studies show that VX-765 reduces inflammation and cytokine levels
in animal dermatitis and arthritis models.

Our
first generation ICE inhibitor, pralnacasan, was developed in collaboration with Sanofi-Aventis (then Aventis). In 2005, our collaboration with Sanofi-Aventis terminated, and
all rights to pralnacasan reverted to us. Phase II clinical trials of pralnacasan conducted by Aventis suggested that treatment with pralnacasan was well tolerated, produced positive
anti-inflammatory effects in patients with RA and led to dose-dependent suppression of the production of IL-1

b

. Aventis also conducted a Phase II clinical
trial of pralnacasan in patients with osteoarthritis. In that trial, there was improvement (29% to 35%) in the primary endpoint in four treatment groups, including the placebo group, during the
12 weeks of the trial, but there were no statistically significant differences in the primary endpoint of the trial between placebo treatment and any of the pralnacasan treatment groups.
However, statistically significant changes in some urine and serum markers of bone and cartilage turnover were observed. In 2003, Aventis and Vertex voluntarily suspended the clinical
development of pralnacasan pending full analysis of findings that emerged from a nine-month nonclinical toxicology study. In that nonclinical study, high doses of pralnacasan were associated with the
development of fibrosis in circumscribed areas of the liver of one species of animal. Nonclinical toxicology studies designed to explore this toxicology issue were completed in 2005, and we
expect data from those nonclinical studies to be presented at a medical conference in 2006.

We
believe these results warrant further study and we may consider entering into a collaborative arrangement to advance the development of either or both of VX-765 and pralnacasan, to
which we hold worldwide development and commercialization rights.


Merimepodib (VX-497) (IMPDH inhibition for the treatment of chronic HCV infection)

We currently are conducting a Phase IIb clinical trial of merimepodib, an oral, small molecule inhibitor of inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase ("IMPDH") for
the treatment of chronic HCV infection. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial (referred to as the "METRO" trial) is designed to study the administration of merimepodib with
peg-IFN and RBV in patients who did not respond to prior treatment with peg-IFN and RBV. The goal of the METRO trial is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of merimepodib in
combination with peg-IFN and RBV. The primary endpoint of the trial is to evaluate the antiviral activity of merimepodib in combination with peg-IFN and RBV and perform an assessment of the proportion
of merimepodib-treated patients who achieve a sustained virologic response, compared to placebo, at week 72 (end of follow up). We expect to complete the METRO trial in 2006. In the HCV field,
we are currently focusing our efforts on the development of direct antivirals such as VX-950. Therefore, we currently do not plan to conduct additional merimepodib clinical trials after the METRO
trial is completed.

We
hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to merimepodib.

Collaborator-Led Programs

Lexiva/Telzir and brecanavir: HIV protease inhibition for the treatment of HIV/AIDS (GlaxoSmithKline plc)

Infection with HIV can lead to AIDS, a severe, life-threatening impairment of the immune system. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
estimates that approximately 40.3 million individuals worldwide are infected with HIV. The United States National Institutes of Health has estimated that there may be as many as 950,000
individuals in the United States infected with HIV. There are four classes of antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as
AZT and 3TC; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as efavirenz; the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide; and HIV protease inhibitors ("HIV PIs"). HIV PIs are used as part of
combination regimens for the treatment of HIV. HIV PIs block the cleavage of HIV polyproteins into active proteins, and result in the production of non-infectious viral particles. The HIV
PI ritonavir has been shown to significantly boost the levels of certain other PIs in the bloodstream and therefore co-administration of HIV PIs with ritonavir has become progressively
more frequent in clinical practice as a strategy for achieving maximum antiviral activity, reducing the likelihood of treatment failure (viral breakthrough), and lowering the overall pill count for
patients. Sales of HIV PIs in the United States exceeded $1.2 billion in 2005, an increase of approximately 11% from 2004. The United States market for HIV PIs is highly competitive, with nine
different HIV PIs approved by the FDA for sale.

Lexiva/Telzir

Our second generation HIV PI, fosamprenavir calcium, is marketed under the name Lexiva in the United States and under the name Telzir in the European Union.
Lexiva/Telzir was co-discovered by us and GlaxoSmithKline and was developed by GlaxoSmithKline pursuant to our collaboration with them. GlaxoSmithKline has worldwide marketing rights for
Lexiva/Telzir, and we have the right to conduct certain promotional and educational activities for Lexiva/Telzir in the United States and the European Union. We also have the right, which we have not
yet exercised, to supply bulk drug substance to GlaxoSmithKline. We receive royalties on GlaxoSmithKline's sales of Lexiva/Telzir.

Lexiva
was launched in the United States in late 2003, and in certain European Union countries in the third quarter of 2004. In 2005, Lexiva was the fourth largest (measured in terms of
sales revenue) HIV PI inhibitor in the United States, excluding ritonavir, and it currently holds an approximate 11% share of the United States HIV PI market (also excluding ritonavir). Lexiva/Telzir
is currently marketed in over 40 countries worldwide, including the United States, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada.


Lexiva/Telzir
is a prodrug of amprenavir, our first generation HIV PI, which also was discovered and developed under our collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline and marketed under the
name Agenerase. Lexiva/Telzir has replaced Agenerase in worldwide markets. A prodrug is an inactive compound that is metabolized by the body to become the active drug. Due to the physical properties
of prodrugs such as Lexiva/Telzir, it is possible to achieve a higher effective dose of the active drug for each prodrug pill administered, resulting in a smaller pill burden for patients.

Brecanavir (VX-385)

Brecanavir (VX-385) is the third novel, orally available HIV PI to enter clinical development from our HIV collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline.
Brecanavir is an aspartyl protease inhibitor, and is chemically distinct from Lexiva/Telzir and other currently marketed PIs. Brecanavir is currently in Phase II clinical development and has
received "Fast Track" designation from the FDA. GlaxoSmithKline is currently conducting a 105-patient Phase IIb clinical trial of brecanavir in combination with retonavir in North
America, Europe and Australia. We expect that the results of this Phase IIb clinical trial will be presented at a medical conference in late 2006. We also expect that GlaxoSmithKline will
commence a Phase III clinical trial program for brecanavir in 2006.

In
2005, GlaxoSmithKline reported interim 24-week results from an open label, 48-week Phase IIa study of brecanavir. In this clinical trial, 31 HIV-1 infected adults
received 300mg of brecanavir twice-daily, boosted with 100mg of ritonavir, in combination with one of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (based on patient medical history and viral
genotype). The interim findings suggested potent antiviral activity for brecanavir in both HIV PI-sensitive and HIV PI-resistant HIV-infected adults
participating in the clinical trial. At week 24, 81% of the patients had plasma HIV-1 RNA below the limit of detection in standard assays (< 400 copies/mL of blood) and 77% of
the patients had viral load below the limit of detection in ultrasensitive assays (< 50 copies/mL of blood). Patients with HIV PI-sensitive and highly HIV
PI-resistant virus had similar response rates. An interim safety assessment suggested that brecanavir was well-tolerated: few Grade 2 to 4 (Common Toxicity Criteria scale)
drug-related adverse events and no serious adverse events were observed. Most adverse events were reported as mild and did not require treatment modification or discontinuation. We expect
final results of this trial will be announced in 2006.

We
hold development and commercialization rights to brecanavir in the Far East, and GlaxoSmithKline holds development and commercialization rights to brecanavir in the rest of the world.

VX-680 and VX-667: Aurora kinase inhibition for the treatment of cancer (Merck & Co., Inc.)

We are collaborating with Merck in the research and development of Aurora kinase inhibitors, including VX-680 and a follow-on compound, which we have
designated VX-667. Aurora kinases are enzymes thought to play multiple roles in the development and progression of cancer, acting as regulators of cell proliferation, transforming normal cells into
cancer cells and downregulating p53, one of the body's natural tumor suppressors. We believe that inhibitors of Aurora kinases may be useful as highly targeted treatments for a range of oncology
indications.

VX-680
is a potent inhibitor of Aurora kinases and of Flt-3 kinase, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is known to be inappropriately activated in several different types of leukemia.
Vertex researchers published the three-dimensional atomic structure of Aurora-A kinase in 2002, and published the structure of Flt-3 kinase in January 2004. We also presented preclinical data
in a number of research and medical venues in 2003 suggesting that VX-680 should be further investigated to determine its potential to treat several different cancer types for which there are
currently few or no available treatments. In a paper published in February 2004, researchers at Vertex reported demonstrating for the first time that a selective small molecule inhibitor of Aurora
kinase (VX-680) inhibited tumor growth and induced tumor regression in xenograft models of human pancreatic and colon cancer. In


addition,
Vertex researchers have presented data showing that VX-680 prolonged survival and induced sustained remission in an oncogene-driven model of acute myelocytic leukemia.

Merck
presently is conducting three Phase I clinical trials of VX-680 in patients with hematologic cancers, with recurrent or non-responsive solid tumors, and
with certain cancers for which standard therapy does not currently exist. In late 2005, Merck demonstrated that dosing VX-680 in patients with solid tumor cancers could produce observed changes in the
activity of a clinically relevant biomarker. We expect that Merck will report the Phase I clinical data for VX-680 in 2006, and also will initiate Phase II clinical development this
year.

In
2005, Merck also selected VX-667, an Aurora kinase inhibitor, for preclinical development. Merck holds worldwide development and commercialization rights to VX-680 and
VX-667.

VX-409: Selective sodium channel modulation for the treatment of pain (GlaxoSmithKline plc)

We are collaborating with GlaxoSmithKline in the clinical development of VX-409, an oral, subtype-selective sodium channel modulator, for the
treatment of pain. Worldwide prescription drug sales for the treatment and management of pain were more than $20 billion in 2004. VX-409 has been shown to be orally bioavailable and
highly active, with a good safety profile, in nonclinical models of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain. VX-409 was discovered through our San Diego-based ion channel research program
using the capabilities and proprietary technologies that are unique to that site. We expect that GlaxoSmithKline will initiate Phase I clinical development of VX-409 early in 2007.

GlaxoSmithKline holds
worldwide development and commercialization rights to VX-409.

VX-944: IMPDH inhibition for the treatment of cancer (Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)

We are collaborating with Avalon Pharmaceuticals in the development of VX-944, an IMPDH inhibitor for the treatment of advanced hematological
malignancies, such as leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma. Recent reports in medical literature and presentations at scientific conferences provide a clinical rationale for the development of IMPDH
inhibitors for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Results from certain preclinical studies of VX-944 indicated that VX-944 inhibited the

in
vitro

proliferation of lymphoid and myeloid cells, the principal cells involved in the most common types of human leukemias. VX-944 also significantly prolonged
survival in a model of aggressive mouse leukemia. In a single-dose, dose-escalation Phase I clinical trial of VX-944 in healthy volunteers, data indicated that
VX-944 was orally bioavailable and well-tolerated.

Avalon
initiated a Phase I clinical trial of VX-944 in January 2006. That clinical trial is designed as an open-label, repeat
dose-escalation clinical trial for the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of VX-944 in up to 36 adult patients with advanced hematological cancer.

Avalon
Pharmaceuticals holds worldwide development and commercialization rights to VX-944.

VX-322: Flt-3/c-kit inhibitor for the treatment of cancer (Novartis Pharma AG)

We are collaborating with Novartis in the preclinical development of VX-322, a dual inhibitor of the flt-3 and c-kit kinases,
for the treatment of certain forms of cancer. Flt-3 kinase and c-kit kinase function as molecular switches that regulate the growth of certain cancers. Flt-3 kinase
inhibition has attracted significant attention among cancer researchers due to its highly targeted approach to the treatment of certain leukemias as well other hematological malignancies and solid
tumors. Flt-3 kinase is abnormally activated or upregulated in a wide range of leukemias, including in more than 70% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia ("AML").
Specific mutations of flt-3 kinase that are believed to be drivers of cell proliferation are present in up to 40% of AML patients. In addition, the protein c-kit has been found
at high levels in 60% to 80% of AML patients. Preclinical studies conducted at Vertex using cells isolated from AML patients suggested that dual flt-3/c-kit inhibition may
provide more potent reduction in cell proliferation than is provided by inhibition of flt-3 kinase or c-kit kinase alone. Current treatment for AML generally involves
aggressive chemotherapy with "non-specific"


agents
that cannot discriminate between healthy and diseased cells, resulting in significant toxicity and limited efficacy. New targeted approaches hold the potential to transform the treatment of
AML, reducing side effects, improving tolerability and increasing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic regimens.

Novartis
holds worldwide development and commercialization rights to VX-322, and an option to obtain similar rights to VX-398, a back-up compound to VX-322.

RESEARCH PROGRAMS

Vertex Drug Design Platform and Drug Discovery Strategy

We believe that our integrated drug design approach has significantly enhanced our ability to discover and develop small molecule drug candidates directed at
biologically complex targets, including novel targets identified by genomic research. We believe that our approach has been validated through our ability to interest prospective collaborators in our
research output and by our success in moving drug candidates into clinical trials.

Integrated Drug Design Approach.

Our drug design platform integrates biology, biophysics, chemistry, automation and
information technologies in a coordinated and simultaneous fashion throughout the discovery process. The goal of our integrated, interdisciplinary approach is to make the drug discovery and
development process more efficient and productive.

Focused Drug Discovery in Target-Rich Gene Families.

We have pioneered a novel approach to drug discovery in
target-rich gene families, which are groups of genes with similar sequences that code for structurally similar proteins. We organize and cluster targets within a gene family according to
how they interact with chemical inhibitors, which allows us to use high-throughput screening technologies, informatics and medicinal chemistry to rapidly identify drug-like
classes of compounds in parallel for multiple targets. Along with this approach, we use a variety of biological and chemical methodologies that interrogate the function of newly discovered proteins in
order to focus our drug discovery and development efforts on the most promising targets within the most promising gene families. We believe that our systematic application of this drug discovery
approach is increasing the speed and efficiency of drug design efforts directed at novel biological targets, and is securing valuable intellectual property for us in gene families of interest.

Technology Platform

We employ a variety of technologies and use information from a number of different scientific disciplines as part of our integrated technology platform. The most
significant of them are as follows.

•

Functional Genomics.

We use functional genomics techniques, such as gene knock-out mice, to help
guide target selection and test the potential of chemical compounds in disease models. We also use antisense, siRNA, dominant negative cell lines, transcriptional profiling, proteomics and other
biological approaches to better characterize the role played by specific targets in cellular processes.

•

Biophysics.

We generate atomic structural information on molecular targets using X-ray
crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance ("NMR") spectroscopy to guide design and optimization of lead classes of drugs.

•

Computer-based Modeling.

We apply advanced proprietary computational modeling tools to guide the evaluation and
selection of compounds for synthesis. During our virtual ("

in silico

") screening process, candidate compounds are selected for synthesis and screening.
We use proprietary algorithms to sort and filter compounds for specific properties in order to seek compounds that are more likely to become development candidates.

•

Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacology.

We employ a number of approaches to obtain predictive information on the
bioavailability, pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy of potential drug


candidates.
These approaches include

in vitro

metabolism and toxicological studies and

in vivo

assessment of leads in predictive animal models.

•

Assay Development.

We use modern cell biology, enzymology, and screening techniques to develop
high-throughput assays which provide high-quality information to support drug discovery. Many of these assays are built upon a number of gene reporter technologies such as
green fluorescent protein and beta lactamase. We also are utilizing our assay capabilities to develop novel proprietary

in vitro

assays to rapidly
establish ADME/toxicology profiles for compounds in our screening library.

•

High-Throughput Screening.

We conduct assays for most enzyme and receptor targets using very
high-throughput screening approaches, many of which are proprietary. These assays enable us to rapidly generate large numbers of lead compounds and drug candidates across targets from many
different gene families. These approaches integrate compound management, plate replication with miniaturized screening, hit (potential lead) identification and follow-up.

•

Instrumentation.

We have a dedicated research and application development group, which is responsible for
designing and building automated solutions to address many of the more repetitive and labor-intensive aspects and processes of drug discovery. For example, most of our ion channel research is
conducted using E-VIPR, our proprietary screening technology that uses fluorescent probes and waves of electrical stimulation to study ion channels. E-VIPR provides an
automated, high-throughput platform that enables us to collect high quality data at speeds up to a thousand times faster than patch clamping.

Current Research Programs

Our past drug discovery efforts have produced a variety of drug candidates that are currently in preclinical or clinical development. We believe our ongoing
research programs, particularly those directed at the kinase and ion channel gene families, continue to create potential value for Vertex by generating new product candidates in areas of significant
unmet medical need. These programs include research targeting certain kinases, ion channels, g-protein coupled receptors and HCV protease inhibitors.

Kinase Program

We have a broad-based drug discovery effort targeting the human protein kinase family, of which there are more than 500 members. Protein kinases are enzymes that
play a key role in transmitting signals between and within cells. Kinases exert their effect by phosphorylating other proteins, which then become activated and perform a specific function. Kinase
activity has been implicated in many major diseases, including cancer and autoimmune, inflammatory, cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurological diseases. As a result, we believe that kinases are ideal
targets for therapeutic intervention. The clinical success of the oncology drugs Gleevec® (imatinib mesylate) and Tarceva® (erlotinib) offer examples of how small molecule
kinase inhibitors can be tailored to address specific diseases.

Under
our collaboration with Novartis, we have conducted extensive parallel drug design efforts within the kinase target family. To date, three development stage kinase inhibitors,
VX-680, VX-322 and VX-271, have emerged from that collaboration, the research portion of which ends in April 2006. In 2004, we entered into a collaboration with Merck for the development of
VX-680, an Aurora kinase inhibitor, in cancer, and for continuing collaborative research in the area of Aurora kinase inhibition. We expect the joint research effort with Merck to continue
until June 2006.


We have drug discovery efforts underway targeting kinases that play a role in the development and progression of cancer, inflammation and autoimmune disease.

Our
extensive drug discovery efforts involving numerous targets in the kinase gene family continue to refine our understanding of kinase biology and the design of kinase inhibitors. Our
researchers have determined the atomic structure of more than 25 kinase drug targets and hundreds of kinase/inhibitor co-complexes. This information is of critical importance in the design
of selective inhibitors for ongoing research projects. We also have designed a diverse library of proprietary kinase inhibitors and we continue to expand that library. We apply all of these tools with
the objective of determining and optimizing new chemical scaffolds against targets of interest in the area of kinase inhibition.

Ion Channel Program

We are conducting a broad-based drug discovery program targeting the ion channel family. Ion channels are a gene family of more than 650 proteins that act as
cellular gatekeepers, controlling the flow of ions across cell membranes. The ion channel family contains numerous drugable targets representing potential therapeutic intervention points for a variety
of indications, including cystic fibrosis, pain and inflammatory, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Existing therapies such as amlodipine and nifedipine, which are calcium channel blockers for
the treatment of hypertension, and lamotrigine and carbamazepine, which are sodium channel inhibitors for the treatment of epilepsy, provide a strong rationale for developing drugs targeting ion
channels.

Our
ion channel research extends across several ion channel subfamilies, including sodium channels and calcium channels, and is principally focused at present on the design and
development of small-molecule drugs for the treatment of pain and cystic fibrosis. For example, specific sodium channels have been shown to increase in expression and function in peripheral nerve
cells at the site of injury, making them novel and attractive targets for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

We
have an ongoing research collaboration with CFFT targeting the CFTR protein. Our research efforts in this collaboration currently are focused on the identification of possible
CFTR protein corrector compounds that may work to increase the number of ion channels in certain lung cell membranes of patients with cystic fibrosis. These ion channels may prevent the
improper accumulation of water and salt (including chloride ions) that is believed to be the cause of mucous accumulation in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.

We
are utilizing our expertise in assay development and screening to advance discovery efforts within the ion channel family.

Additional Discovery Efforts

We plan to utilize our proprietary gene family-based platform and experience in structure-based drug design to pursue targets in other medically important gene
families. We have significant efforts underway targeting g-protein coupled receptors and back-up HCV protease inhibitors, among other things.

CORPORATE COLLABORATIONS

We have entered into corporate collaborations with pharmaceutical and other companies and organizations that provide financial and other resources, including
capabilities in research, development, manufacturing, and sales and marketing, to support our research and development programs. At present, we have the following major corporate collaborations.

GlaxoSmithKline plc

In December 1993, we entered into a collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline covering the research, development and commercialization of HIV protease inhibitors,
including Agenerase (amprenavir), Lexiva/Telzir (fosamprenavir calcium) and brecanavir (VX-385). Under the original agreement,


GlaxoSmithKline had
exclusive rights to develop and commercialize our HIV PIs in all parts of the world except the Far East. In 2003, we amended the agreement to add the Far East to
GlaxoSmithKline's territory for development and commercialization of Lexiva/Telzir. GlaxoSmithKline pays us a royalty on all sales of the HIV PIs covered by the agreement. We have retained certain
bulk drug manufacturing rights and certain co-promotion rights in the territories licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. Under the collaborative agreement, GlaxoSmithKline agreed to pay the Company
up to $42 million, comprised of an up-front $15 million license payment made in 1993, $14 million of product research funding over five years and $13 million of
development and commercialization milestone payments for an initial drug candidate. Research funding under this agreement ended on December 31, 1998 and Vertex has received the entire
$42 million referenced above. We began earning a royalty from GlaxoSmithKline in 1999 on sales of Agenerase, in the fourth quarter of 2003 on sales of Lexiva, and in the third quarter of 2004
on sales of Telzir. GlaxoSmithKline is also obligated to pay additional development and commercialization milestone payments for subsequent drug candidates, including brecanavir. If brecanavir is
successfully commercialized, GlaxoSmithKline must pay us royalties on any future sales of brecanavir. GlaxoSmithKline bears the costs of development in its territory under the collaboration.
GlaxoSmithKline has the right to terminate its agreement with us without cause upon 12 months' notice. Termination of the agreement by GlaxoSmithKline will relieve it of its obligation to make
further commercialization and development milestone and royalty payments, and will end any license granted by us to GlaxoSmithKline under the agreement. In June 1996, we and GlaxoSmithKline
obtained a worldwide, non-exclusive license under certain G.D. Searle & Co. (now owned by Pharmacia/Pfizer) patents in the area of HIV protease inhibition. We pay Searle a royalty
based on sales of Lexiva/Telzir.

In
December 2005, we entered into a separate collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline for the development and commercialization of VX-409. Under the terms
of the agreement, GlaxoSmithKline has the exclusive right and license to develop and commercialize VX-409 and certain specified back-up compounds worldwide. The agreement
provides for a $20 million up-front license payment, which was paid in December 2005, and potentially additional development and commercial milestone payments based on the
development of VX-409 and back-up compounds in major pharmaceutical markets across a range of indications. GlaxoSmithKline will also pay us royalties on annual net sales of any
pharmaceutical products commercialized under the agreement. Prior to commercial launch of any drug that is covered by the agreement, GlaxoSmithKline can terminate the agreement without cause upon six
months' notice to us. Following commercial launch, GlaxoSmithKline can terminate the agreement on one year's notice, unless the termination is the result of a safety issue associated with a drug
arising from the collaboration, in which case GlaxoSmithKline may terminate immediately upon notice.

Merck & Co., Inc.

In June 2004, we entered into a global collaboration with Merck to develop and commercialize VX-680, our lead Aurora kinase inhibitor, for the
treatment of cancer, and to conduct research targeting the discovery of an additional Aurora kinase inhibitory compound or compounds to follow VX-680. Merck made an up-front license
payment of $20 million in June 2004, and the collaboration agreement also provides for research funding of $14 million over the first two years of the collaboration (from
June 2004 to June 2006). In addition, the agreement provides for as much as $350 million in milestone payments, including up to $130 million for the successful development
of VX-680 in the first oncology indication and additional milestone payments for development of VX-680 and follow-on compounds in subsequent major oncology
indications. Two milestone payments under the agreement, totaling $19.5 million, were made in December 2005. Under the agreement, Merck is responsible for worldwide clinical development
and commercialization of VX-680 and follow-on candidates (including VX-667, which Merck selected for preclinical development in 2005) and will pay us royalties on product sales.
Merck may terminate the agreement at any time without cause upon 90 days' advance written notice, except that six months' advance written notice is required for termination during the second


year
of the research term (ending June 2006), or at any time when a product has marketing approval in a major market and the termination is not the result of a safety issue.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated

In May 2004, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ("CFFT") providing funding for our
late-stage cystic fibrosis drug discovery effort. The agreement subsequently was amended to extend the term of the drug discovery effort to March 31, 2008. Under the amended
agreement, we retain the right to develop and commercialize any compounds discovered in the course of the research collaboration, and we will pay a royalty to CFFT on the net sales of any drugs
discovered in the collaboration. The agreement, as amended, provides for CFFT to make up to $21 million of research payments through December 31, 2005, and for it to fund up to an
additional $22 million for further research from January 1, 2006 through March 31, 2008 directed toward CFTR corrector compounds. The agreement also provides that CFFT will
make a $1.5 million milestone payment to us upon advancement of the first compound from the research program into clinical development. CFFT has the right to terminate the agreement without
cause, effective on June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2007, upon 60 days' prior written notice.

Novartis Pharma AG

In May 2000, we entered into an agreement with Novartis to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule drugs directed at
protein kinases. We amended this collaboration agreement in February 2004. Under the original agreement, we were responsible for drug discovery and clinical
proof-of-concept testing of all drug candidates. Novartis agreed to pay us up to $200 million in research funding through April 2006, and to loan us up to
$200 million on a non-interest-bearing basis to support our clinical proof-of-concept studies. Under the amended agreement, we will continue to receive
research funding through April 2006. Novartis holds an option to develop drug candidates meeting certain pre-agreed criteria. The option is exercisable with respect to each
development candidate at the pre-development stage, at which point a $10 million milestone payment will be due from Novartis with up to $25 million in additional
pre-commercial milestone payments. Following completion of the six-year research term in April 2006, Novartis' development option with respect to all compounds discovered in the research
program will terminate no later than the end of a specified period following delivery by us to Novartis of a final research report. We retain all rights to any candidate not selected by Novartis, as
well as to all of our intellectual property generated under the collaboration that is not specific to candidates selected by Novartis for development. As part of the amended agreement, restrictions
under the original agreement that limited Novartis' right to pursue kinase research and development outside our collaboration were removed, and the development loan facility was terminated. In
November 2004, Novartis accepted VX-322 for preclinical development under the amended terms of our collaboration agreement, and made a $10 million milestone payment. Novartis
will have exclusive worldwide development, manufacturing and commercialization rights to VX-322 and any other drug candidates that it accepts from us for development. We will receive
royalties on any products that are marketed as part of the collaboration.

Also
under the amended agreement, we retained the right either to develop VX-680 to proof-of-concept under the terms of the original agreement, or to
elect to remove VX-680, and the Aurora kinases that it targets, from the Novartis collaboration. We exercised this election in June 2004, as part of our collaboration with Merck,
described above, and repaid to Novartis approximately $12.5 million in unspent and uncommitted development loans previously advanced on account of VX-680. Outstanding loans relating
to collaboration compounds other than VX-680 will be forgiven on a compound-by-compound basis if any such compounds are selected by Novartis for development. All
loans not forgiven under the facility will be repayable, without interest, in May 2008. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $20 million in remaining loans outstanding under
the loan facility.


Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation

In June 2004, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with Mitsubishi for the development and commercialization of
VX-950, our lead oral HCV protease inhibitor, in Japan and certain other Far East countries. Under the terms of the agreement, Mitsubishi has the right to develop and commercialize
VX-950 in its territory, and we have exclusive development and marketing rights to VX-950 in the rest of the world. Under the agreement, we are entitled to receive up to
$33 million in payments from Mitsubishi through Phase II clinical development, including a license fee, development milestone payments and contributions to certain drug development costs
incurred by us for VX-950. Further cost sharing beyond Phase II clinical development will be determined by Mitsubishi and us based on the design of registration trials for
VX-950. We will also be entitled to royalties on sales of VX-950, if approved, in Mitsubishi's territory. Mitsubishi may terminate the agreement at any time without cause upon
60 days' prior written notice.

Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

In September 1997, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Kissei to identify and develop compounds that target p38 MAP kinase. The research phase of the
collaboration ended on June 30, 2000, and we have received the full amount of research funding specified under the agreement. We are working with Kissei to develop and commercialize
VX-702, which was discovered during our p38 MAP kinase research collaboration. Kissei has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize VX-702 in Japan and certain Far East
countries, and co-exclusive rights (with us) in China, Taiwan and South Korea. We retain exclusive marketing rights outside the Far East. Under our agreement, Kissei will pay us
development and commercialization milestone payments for the successful development and commercialization of VX-702 in the Far East, including $2.5 million paid in 2005 upon
Kissei's submission of regulatory filings in preparation for Phase I clinical trials of VX-702 in Japan. Kissei is providing a portion of the funding for our clinical trials of
VX-702 in RA. If VX-702 is approved for sale in Kissei's territory, we will have the right to supply Kissei with bulk drug substance for manufacture by Kissei into drug product. We will
receive drug supply payments or royalties on any product sales.

Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

In February 2005, we entered into a license agreement with Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the development and commercialization of the IMPDH inhibitor
VX-944 for the treatment of cancer. Under the agreement, Avalon has the exclusive worldwide right and responsibility to develop and commercialize VX-944 for the treatment of
cancer. Avalon has made a $5.0 million up-front license payment to us, and has agreed to make additional milestone payments to us for the successful development of VX-944 in
multiple oncology indications. Avalon will pay us royalties on any product sales. The agreement provides us with certain rights to co-promote VX-944. Neither Avalon nor Vertex
has the right to terminate the agreement other than for cause.


OTHER MATTERS

Intellectual Property

We actively seek protection for our products and proprietary information by means of United States and foreign patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as
appropriate. In addition, we rely upon trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information and products. In addition to patents and pending patent
applications that relate to potential drug targets, compounds we are developing to modulate those targets, and methods of making or using those compounds, we have several patents and pending patent
applications directed to proprietary elements of our drug discovery platform. For example, some of these "platform" patents and applications claim our proprietary E-VIPR ion channel
screening technology.

Much
of our technology and many of our processes depend upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel. To protect our rights to our proprietary
know-how and technology, we require all employees, as well as our consultants and advisors when feasible, to enter into confidentiality agreements that require disclosure and assignment to
Vertex of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants and advisors in the course of their service to Vertex.

Patents and Pending Patent Applications

We hold issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States, and in foreign countries we deem appropriate, covering intellectual property
developed as part of each of our advanced research, development and commercial programs. Our intellectual property holdings include:

•

United
States and worldwide pending applications covering VX-950, and many other hepatitis C protease inhibitors.

•

issued
United States patents and pending applications covering assays useful to evaluate potential inhibitors of hepatitis C protease, including patents and applications
covering the X-ray crystal structures of hepatitis C protease and the use of those structures to develop hepatitis C protease inhibitors.

•

an
issued United States patent that covers a class of chemical compounds that includes VX-702 as well as compositions including VX-702 and similar compounds and
the use of those compounds to treat p38 MAP kinase related disorders.

•

other related compounds.

•

issued
United States patents that cover classes of chemical compounds, pharmaceutical formulations and uses of the same for treating HIV infection and AIDS. These patents
include specific coverage for fosamprenavir and its pharmaceutical formulations, methods of manufacture and methods to treat HIV infection or AIDS-related central nervous system disorders.
In addition we have a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent applications claiming HIV PIs. We have an issued patent in the United States and patents and pending
applications in other countries claiming amprenavir and related compounds, as well as brecanavir (VX-385).

•

issued
United States patents and pending patent applications worldwide claiming inhibitors of multiple kinase proteins, including the Aurora kinase/Flt-3 kinase
inhibitor VX-680, the Flt-3/c-kit kinase inhibitor VX-322 and the kinase inhibitor VX-271.

•

pending
United States and foreign patent applications covering modulators of sodium ion channels and uses thereof, including VX-409 and many other related
compounds.


•

pending
United States and foreign patent applications covering bacterial gyrase inhibitors including VX-692 and VX-883 and the use of these compounds
for the treatment of bacterial infections.

•

issued
United States patents that cover classes of chemical compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds, and methods of using those compounds to treat
or prevent IMPDH-mediated diseases, including HCV infection. These patents claim merimepodib (VX-497) and VX-944, their combination with certain other therapeutic agents and their use for
treating HCV infection and other IMPDH-mediated diseases.

•

issued
United States patents covering several different classes of compounds useful as inhibitors of ICE, as well as pharmaceutical compositions containing those compounds
and methods of using those compounds to treat ICE-related diseases. These patents and applications include a series of patents and applications purchased from Sanofi S.A. in
July 1997, including a United States patent that covers DNA sequences encoding ICE. We also have applications pending in the United States and other countries claiming VX-765,
pralnacasan (VX-740) and related compounds.

From
time to time we enter into non-exclusive license agreements for proprietary third-party technology used in connection with our research activities. These license agreements
typically provide for the payment by us of a license fee, but may also include terms providing for milestone payments or royalties for the development and/or commercialization of our drug products
arising from the related research. For example, we have entered into a non-exclusive license arrangement with Chiron Corporation for rights to technology in the HCV area that provides Chiron
with certain milestone and royalty payment rights.

Manufacturing

As we advance our proprietary drug candidates through clinical development toward commercialization, we will be required to significantly augment our
manufacturing, logistics, supply chain and quality assurance resources. We currently rely on networks of third party manufacturers and suppliers worldwide to synthesize, tablet, and package our drug
candidates for clinical trials, and we expect that we will continue to do so to meet our commercial supply needs for those products, if they are approved for sale. We plan to identify and enter into
commercial relationships with multiple suppliers of the materials and manufacturing services necessary for the synthesis, tableting and packaging of our drug candidates and, if approved for sale, our
drugs. We believe that this approach will reduce our risk of supply chain disruption by limiting our reliance on any one supplier or manufacturer. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able
to establish a second source for each stage of manufacturing and supplying our drug candidates and/or commercial products. We currently are seeking to reduce our VX-950 supply chain risk by
identifying and engaging additional vendors for various processes in the manufacture and supply of VX-950 tablets.

We
are focusing resources on the development of systems and processes to track, monitor and oversee our manufacturers' and suppliers' activities. We evaluate the performance of our third
party manufacturers and suppliers and confirm their continuing capabilities to meet our needs efficiently and economically.

We
have established a quality assurance program intended to ensure that our third-party manufacturers and suppliers produce our compounds in accordance with the FDA's current Good
Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and other applicable regulations. We expect that we may need to increase our quality assurance resources in connection with the commercial launch of any drug product.

The
production of our drug candidates is based in part on technology that we believe to be proprietary. We license this technology to our suppliers and manufacturers to enable them to
manufacture drug candidates for us. However, in the course of their services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our drug candidates that the


manufacturer
owns, either independently or jointly with us. This might increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer if we wished to have our
products manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process.

Commercial
manufacturing of Lexiva/Telzir is being done by GlaxoSmithKline. We retain the option to manufacture a portion of GlaxoSmithKline's requirements for bulk drug substance for
Lexiva/Telzir. If we were to exercise that option, we believe we would need to rely upon one or more contract manufacturers to manufacture the bulk drug substance on our behalf.

Competition

We are engaged in biopharmaceutical fields characterized by extensive research efforts, rapid technological progress and intense competition. There are many
public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies, chemical companies and biotechnology companies, engaged in developing products for the same human therapeutic applications as those we
are targeting. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and are more experienced in the development of new drugs than we are. In order for
us to compete successfully, we may need to demonstrate improved safety, efficacy, ease of manufacturing and market acceptance of our products over the products of our competitors that have or will
receive regulatory approval for marketing.

A
variety of companies are attempting to develop new treatments for HCV infection. Schering-Plough Corporation is developing SCH503034, an orally available HCV protease inhibitor, for
which it is currently conducting a Phase II clinical trial. SCH503034 received "Fast Track" designation from the FDA in early 2006. Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing valopicitabine, an
orally available inhibitor of HCV RNA polymerase, which is responsible for synthesizing viral RNA during HCV replication. Valopicitabine is currently in Phase II trials, and Idenix has announced plans
to commence Phase III clinical trials of this compound in the first half of 2006. There may be other potential HCV treatments in research or early development.

A
wide range of drugs are being investigated for the treatment of RA, including several drugs that are currently being marketed for other indications, such as Prograf®
(tacrolimus), an immunosuppressant. Bristol-Myers Squibb recently received marketing approval from the FDA for Orencia® (abatacept), an intravenous T-cell
co-stimulator for the treatment of RA. Roche is in Phase III development of Actemra® (tocilizumab), an IL-6 monoclonal antibody. In February 2006, Genentech and Biogen
Inc. received approval from the FDA to market Rituxan (rituximab), Genentech Inc.'s drug product currently sold as a lymphoma treatment, in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of
RA. In the field of p38 MAP kinase inhibitors for the treatment of RA, over the last three years a number of companies, including Vertex, Amgen Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, Bristol-Myers Squibb
Company, Boerhinger Ingelheim GmbH, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Co., Ltd. and Scios, Inc. have initiated Phase I clinical trials. Of these, to date, Vertex, Boerhinger
Ingelheim, Scios and Takeda have announced advancement of drug candidates to Phase II clinical trials. The commercialization of any of the therapies or other novel treatments for RA by Vertex
competitors may adversely alter the competitive landscape for VX-702.

Several
companies are engaged in the process of developing treatments for cystic fibrosis. For example, PTC Therapeutics, Inc. has recently announced the commencement of several
Phase II clinical trials for PTC124, a drug candidate that targets nonsense genetic mutations which can cause cystic fibrosis in some populations. Altus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing
TheraCLEC, an orally delivered enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of pancreatic insufficiency, a condition that affects many cystic fibrosis patients. Inspire Pharmaceuticals Inc.
currently is conducting Phase III clinical trials of denufosol tetrasodium, an inhaled molecule that activates an alternate chloride channel in the airway of cystic fibrosis patients.

In
the field of HIV protease inhibition, Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc., among others, have
other HIV PIs in various stages


of
development. In addition to the nine currently marketed protease inhibitors, each of these compounds and others that may be in research or development may eventually compete with Lexiva/Telzir and,
if it is successfully developed, brecanavir.

Government Regulation

Our development, manufacture and potential sale of therapeutics are subject to extensive regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities. In
particular, pharmaceutical products are subject to rigorous preclinical, nonclinical and clinical testing and to other approval requirements by the FDA in the United States under the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, and by comparable agencies in most foreign countries. Although we have summarized the FDA process below, other countries may have different approval processes with which we will need to
comply if we seek to conduct clinical trials or obtain marketing approval in those countries. In addition, even if we ultimately intend to seek initial marketing approval in the United States, we may
conduct early clinical trials in other countries, for a variety of reasons, and therefore our initial Investigational New Drug ("IND") filing in the United States may not occur until after one or more
foreign-sited clinical trials.

Approval Process

As an initial step in the FDA regulatory approval process, short term preclinical studies typically are conducted in animals to help identify potential safety
problems which might be associated with administration of the drug candidate being tested over the period of time planned for the initial human trials. For certain diseases, animal models exist that
are believed to be predictive of efficacy in humans. For such diseases, a drug candidate is typically tested for efficacy in that animal model. The results of these preclinical safety and disease
model studies are submitted to the FDA as a part of the IND which is filed to comply with FDA regulations prior to commencement of human clinical testing in the United States. For several of our drug
candidates, no appropriately predictive animal model exists. As a result, no

in vivo

evidence of efficacy will be available until those compounds
progress to human clinical trials. A variety of nonclinical studies in a number of animal species, and other nonclinical studies, ordinarily are conducted while human clinical trials are underway, to
provide supplemental toxicology and other information and to help provide a foundation for the design of broader and more lengthy human clinical trials as a drug candidate progresses through the
review and approval process.

Clinical
trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap. Phase I frequently begins with the initial introduction of the drug candidate into
healthy human subjects prior to introduction into patients. The drug candidate is then tested in a relatively small number of patients for safety on a preliminary basis, dosage tolerance, absorption,
bioavailability, biodistribution, metabolism, excretion, clinical pharmacology and, if possible, for early information on effectiveness. Phase II typically involves studies in a small sample of the
intended patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug for a specific indication, to determine dose tolerance and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety
and potential adverse effects. Phase III trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed study sites, to determine
the overall risk-benefit ratio of the drug candidate and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Each trial is conducted in accordance with standards set forth in protocols
that detail the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. For clinical trials in the United States, each protocol must be
submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be evaluated by an independent Institutional Review Board ("IRB") at the institution at which the trial will be conducted.
The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution.

Data
from nonclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in a New Drug Application ("NDA") for United States marketing approval. The process of completing nonclinical
and clinical testing and obtaining FDA approval for a new drug is likely to take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. Preparing an NDA involves considerable data


collection,
verification, analysis and expense, and there can be no assurance that approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The approval process is affected by a number of factors,
including the severity of the targeted disease, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA may deny an NDA if applicable regulatory
criteria are not satisfied or may require additional testing or information. Among the conditions for marketing approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer's quality control and
manufacturing procedures conform to the FDA's cGMP regulations, which must be followed at all times. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend
time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, also are subject to inspections by or
under the authority of the FDA and by or under the authority of other federal, state or local agencies.

Under
the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, the United States FDA may grant "Fast Track designation" to facilitate the development of a drug intended for the treatment of a serious or
life-threatening condition if the drug demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The benefits of Fast Track designation include scheduled meetings with the FDA to
receive input on development plans, the option of submitting an NDA in sections (rather than submitting all components simultaneously), and the option of requesting evaluation of studies using
surrogate endpoints. Fast Track designation does not necessarily lead to a priority review or accelerated approval of a drug candidate by the FDA. VX-950 and brecanavir have received Fast
Track designation by the FDA.

Timing to Approval

We estimate that it generally takes 10 to 15 years, or possibly longer, to discover, develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United
States as outlined below:

Phase:

Objective:

Estimated

Duration:

Discovery

Lead identification and target validation

2 to 4 years

Preclinical

Initial toxicology for preliminary identification of risks for humans; gather early pharmacokinetic data

1 to 2 years

Phase I

Evaluate safety in humans; study how the drug works, metabolizes and interacts with other drugs

1 to 2 years

Phase II

Establish effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage; continue safety evaluation

2 to 4 years

Phase III

Confirm efficacy, dosage regime and safety profile of the drug; submit New Drug Application

2 to 4 years

FDA approval

Approval by the FDA to sell and market the drug for the approved indication

6 months to 2 years

A
proposed drug candidate may fail at any point during this process. Animal and other nonclinical studies typically are conducted during each phase of human clinical trials.

Post-approval Studies

Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies, including post-approval trials, may be required to provide additional data on
safety and will be required to gain approval for the sale of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested and approved. Also, the FDA
will require post-approval reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug. Results of post-approval programs may limit or expand the indications for which the drug product
may be marketed. Further, if there are any requests for modifications to the initial FDA approval for the drug, including changes in indication, manufacturing process, labeling or manufacturing
facilities, a supplemental NDA may be required to be submitted to the FDA.


Other Regulations

Pursuant to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, under certain conditions a sponsor may be granted marketing exclusivity for a
period of five years following FDA approval of certain drug applications. During this period, third parties would not be permitted to obtain FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an
Abbreviated NDA, which is the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. The statute also allows a patent owner to extend the term of the patent for a period
equal to one-half the period of time elapsed between the filing of an IND and the filing of the corresponding NDA plus the period of time between the filing of the NDA and FDA approval. We
intend to seek the benefits of this statute, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such benefits.

Whether
or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a drug product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of commercial sales of
the product in such countries. Historically, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product approvals, and the time required for approval, have varied widely from country to
country.

In
addition to the statutes and regulations described above, we are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic
Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state and local regulations.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

WE EXPECT TO INCUR FUTURE LOSSES AND WE MAY NEVER BECOME PROFITABLE.

We have incurred significant operating losses each year since our inception and expect to incur a significant operating loss in 2006. We believe that operating
losses will continue beyond 2006, even if we receive significant future payments under our existing and future collaborative agreements, because we are planning to make significant investments in
research and development, and because we will incur significant selling, general and administrative expenses in the course of researching, developing and commercializing our product candidates. We
expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and that such fluctuations may be substantial. We cannot predict when we will become profitable, if at all.

MANY OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ARE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND ALL OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES REMAIN SUBJECT TO CLINICAL TESTING AND REGULATORY APPROVAL. IF WE ARE
UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND TEST OUR DRUG CANDIDATES, WE WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our drug candidates successfully. Our drug candidates are in various
stages of development. Our drug candidates must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for sale. To satisfy these
standards, we must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of our drug candidates. Despite our efforts, our drug candidates may not:

•

offer
therapeutic or other improvement over existing comparable drugs;

•

be
proven safe and effective in clinical trials;

•

meet
applicable regulatory standards;

•

be
capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs; or

•

if
approved for commercial sale, be successfully commercialized.

Positive
results in preclinical studies of a drug candidate may not be predictive of similar results in humans during clinical trials, and promising results from early clinical trials of
a drug candidate may not be replicated in later clinical trials. Findings in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical trials could result in abrupt changes in our development
activities, including the possible cessation of development activities associated with a drug candidate. Furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical
significance required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug candidate.

A
number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in early
stage development. Accordingly, the results from the completed preclinical studies and clinical trials and ongoing clinical trials for our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results we may
obtain in later stage trials, and are not predictive of the likelihood of approval of a drug candidate for commercial sale.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN U.S. AND/OR FOREIGN REGULATORY APPROVAL, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG CANDIDATES.

Our drug candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to their development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization.
Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required in the United States and in most other countries prior to the commercial sale of our drug
candidates. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. It is possible that none of the drug candidates we are
developing will be approved for marketing.

We
have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA. The time required to complete clinical
trials and for the FDA and other countries' regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many


years.
Our analysis of data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory
approval. We may also encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of
product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review.

Any
delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize any drug candidate. Furthermore, any regulatory
approval to market a drug product may be subject to unexpected limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the drug product. These limitations may limit the size of the market for the
drug product.

We
are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party
reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign
requirements. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States. Foreign jurisdictions may have different approval procedures than those required by the
FDA and may impose additional testing requirements for our drug candidates.

IF CLINICAL TRIALS FOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ARE PROLONGED OR DELAYED, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ON A TIMELY BASIS, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO INCUR
ADDITIONAL COSTS AND WOULD DELAY OUR RECEIPT OF ANY PRODUCT REVENUE.

We cannot predict whether or not we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory
authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from our completed or ongoing clinical trials. Any of the following could delay the clinical development of our drug
candidates:

•

ongoing
discussions with the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;

•

delays
in receiving or the inability to obtain required approvals from IRBs or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;

•

delays
in enrolling volunteers and patients into clinical trials;

•

a
lower than anticipated retention rate of volunteers and patients in clinical trials;

•

the
need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive results or unforeseen complications in testing;

•

inadequate
supply or deficient quality of drug candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;

•

unfavorable
FDA inspection and review of a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation;

•

serious
and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials; or

•

the
placement by the FDA of a clinical hold on a trial.

Our
ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis will be subject to a number of factors, including the size of the patient population,
the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. In
addition, subjects may drop out of our clinical trials, and thereby possibly impair the validity or statistical significance of the trials. Delays in patient enrollment or unforeseen drop out rates
may result in increased costs and longer development times. While all or a portion of these additional costs may be covered by payments under our collaborative agreements, we bear all of the costs for
our development candidates for which we have no financial support from a collaborator.


We,
the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time if we or they believe the subjects or patients participating in such
clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons.

We
cannot predict whether any of our drug candidates will encounter problems during clinical trials which will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend these trials, or
which will delay the analysis of data from these trials. In addition, it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations
will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. If we experience any such problems, we may not have the financial resources to continue development of the drug candidate that is
affected or the development of any of our other drug candidates.

IF OUR PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO DELAYS IN FILING NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETING OF
PRODUCTS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN APPROVED.

We currently are developing drug product candidates for regulatory approval for the first time since the Company's inception, and are in the process of
implementing regulated processes and systems required to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates. Certain of these processes and systems for conducting clinical trials and
manufacturing material must be compliant with regulatory requirements before we can apply for regulatory approval for our drug product candidates. These processes and systems will be subject to
continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. If we are unable to achieve compliance in a timely fashion, we may experience delays in filing for regulatory approval
for our drug product candidates. In addition, any later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues with approved products or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with
regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of products from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by
the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business. In addition, we are a party to collaboration agreements that
transfer responsibility for complying with specified regulatory requirements, such as filing and maintenance of marketing authorizations and safety reporting, to our collaborator. If our collaborators
do not fulfill these regulatory obligations, any products for which we or they obtain approval may be withdrawn from the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.

EVEN IF WE OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS, OUR DRUG CANDIDATES WILL BE SUBJECT TO ONGOING REGULATORY REVIEW. IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CONTINUING U.S. AND APPLICABLE FOREIGN
REGULATIONS, WE COULD LOSE THOSE APPROVALS, AND OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED.

Even if we receive regulatory approval of any drug candidates that we are developing, we will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including the review of
clinical results that are reported after our drug candidates become commercially available, approved drugs. Since drugs are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained, side effects
and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated during pre-approval clinical trials. In addition, the manufacturers and the manufacturing facilities we
engage to make any of our drug candidates will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the drug, manufacturers or
manufacturing facilities may result in restrictions on the drug, manufacturers or facilities, including withdrawal of the drug from the market or our inability to use the facilities to make our drug.
If we fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, operating
restrictions and criminal prosecutions.


OUR DRUG DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE DATA-DRIVEN AND THEREFORE POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO ABRUPT CHANGES IN EXPECTED OUTCOMES.

Small molecule drug discovery and development involve, initially, the identification of chemical compounds which may have promise as treatments for specific
diseases. Once identified as drug candidates, compounds are subjected to years of testing in a laboratory setting, in animals and in people. Our ultimate objective is to determine whether the
compounds have physical characteristics, both intrinsically and in animal and human systems and including a toxicological profile, that are compatible with clinical and commercial success in treatment
of the disease being targeted. Throughout this process, experiments are conducted and data are gathered that could reinforce a decision to move to the next step in the evaluation process for a
particular drug candidate, could result in uncertainty over the proper course to pursue, or could result in the termination of further drug development efforts with respect to the compound being
evaluated. We monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical studies and clinical trials and regularly evaluate and re-evaluate our portfolio investments with the
objective of balancing risk and potential return in view of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights. This process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new
information comes to light and we gain additional insights into ongoing programs and potential new programs.

WE DEPEND ON THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS, AND AS A RESULT WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL.

We expect that we will need to significantly augment our manufacturing, supply chain and quality assurance resources for our later-stage drug product candidates.
We have no experience in manufacturing pharmaceutical products and in conducting manufacturing testing programs required to obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals, and there can be no assurance
that we will develop those capabilities successfully. If we are unable to establish these capabilities, we may be unable to achieve our development and commercialization goals. We are currently
relying on networks of third party manufacturers and suppliers worldwide to synthesize, tablet, and package our drug candidates for clinical trials and we expect that we will continue to do so to meet
our commercial supply needs for these products, if they are approved for sale. As a result of our reliance on these third party manufacturers and suppliers, some of whom currently are our sole source
for clinical trial material, we may be subject to significant supply disruptions outside of our control. These supply disruptions may result from a number of factors including shortages in product raw
materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, and shipping and customs delays. We plan to identify and enter into commercial relationships with multiple suppliers
of the materials and manufacturing services necessary for the synthesis, tableting and packaging of our drug candidates and, if approved for sale, our drugs. We expect that this approach will reduce
our risk of supply chain disruptions by reducing our reliance on any one manufacturer or supplier, but we will remain vulnerable to disruptions arising from performance failure by a vendor in our
manufacturing supply chain, particularly if we are unable to secure second sources for necessary products and services. Any supply disruptions could impact the timing of our clinical trials and the
commercial launch of any approved pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, we may be required to modify our production methods to permit us to economically manufacture our products for commercial launch
and sale. Upon approval of a pharmaceutical product for sale, if any, we similarly may be at risk of supply chain disruption for our commercial drug supply. These modifications may require us to
reevaluate our resources and the resources of our third party manufacturers and suppliers, which could result in abrupt changes in our production methods and supplies. The production of our drug
candidates is based in part on technology that we believe to be proprietary. We have licensed this technology to enable our third party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture drug candidates for
us. However, in the course of their services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our drug candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently
or jointly with us. This would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have our products manufactured by other suppliers
utilizing the same process.


WE RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO CONDUCT OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, AND THOSE THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT PERFORM SATISFACTORILY, INCLUDING FAILING TO MEET ESTABLISHED DEADLINES FOR THE
COMPLETION OF SUCH TRIALS.

We do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates, and we rely on third parties such as contract research organizations,
medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct our clinical trials. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our
control over these activities. Accordingly, these third-party contractors may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or
our trial design. To date, we believe our contract research organizations and other similar entities with which we are working generally have performed well. However, if these third parties do not
successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be required to replace them. Although we believe that there are a number of other third-party contractors we could
engage to continue these activities, it may result in a delay of the affected trial. Accordingly, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates may be delayed.

OUR SALES AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE IS LIMITED.

We have limited experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products. We must either develop a marketing and sales force or enter into arrangements with
third parties to market and sell any of our product candidates that are approved by regulatory authorities. We do not know whether we will be able to enter into marketing and sales agreements with
others on acceptable terms, if at all. We may not be able to successfully develop our own sales and marketing force for drug candidates for which we have retained marketing or co-promotion
rights. As we develop our own marketing and sales capability, we may be competing with other companies that currently have experienced and well-funded marketing and sales operations. We
have granted exclusive marketing rights for Lexiva/Telzir, brecanavir (VX-385) and VX-409 to GlaxoSmithKline worldwide (except for brecanavir in the Far East where we have retained
rights), and for VX-680 and VX-667 to Merck. Avalon Pharmaceuticals has exclusive, worldwide marketing rights to VX-944. Mitsubishi has exclusive marketing rights to
VX-950 in Japan and certain Far East countries. In addition, we have granted marketing rights to VX-702 to Kissei in the Far East and to VX-322 to Novartis worldwide. Even though we retain
some co-promotion rights in some collaborations, to the extent that our collaborators have commercial rights to our products, any revenues we receive from those products will depend
primarily on the sales and marketing efforts of others.

WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.

We expect to incur substantial research and development and related supporting expenses as we design and develop existing and future compounds, undertake clinical
trials of drug candidates resulting from such compounds, and build our manufacturing, regulatory, development and commercial capabilities. We also expect to incur substantial administrative and
commercialization expenditures in the future and substantial expenses related to the filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims. We may need to make
significant capital investment in building our manufacturing capacity and creating pre-launch inventory for one or more of our potential products. We anticipate that we will finance these substantial
cash needs with:

•

cash
received from our existing collaborative agreements;

•

cash
received from new collaborative agreements;

•

Lexiva/Telzir
royalty revenue;

•

existing
cash reserves, together with interest earned on those reserves; and

•

future
product sales to the extent that we market products directly.


We
expect that funds from these sources will be sufficient to fund our planned activities for at least the next eighteen months from the date of this filing. If not, it will be necessary
to raise additional funds through public offerings or private placements of equity or debt securities or other methods of financing. Even if our financial resources are sufficient to meet our short or
intermediate term needs, we may still decide, as we have in the past, to raise additional funds when we believe financial market conditions are favorable. Any equity financings could result in
dilution to our then-existing security holders. Any debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that, among other things, restrict our ability to pay dividends and interest
(although we do not intend
to pay dividends for the foreseeable future). The required interest payments associated with any significant additional debt financing could materially adversely affect our ability to service our
convertible subordinated notes and convertible senior subordinated notes. The terms of any additional debt financing may also, under certain circumstances, restrict or prohibit us from making interest
payments on our convertible subordinated notes and convertible senior subordinated notes. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of
our research, drug discovery or development programs (including clinical trials), or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights
to certain of our technologies or products in research or development. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN COLLABORATORS FOR RESEARCH SUPPORT AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FUND OUR RESEARCH,
DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES.

Our research, development and commercialization collaborators have agreed to fund portions of our research and development programs and/or to conduct the
development and commercialization of specified product candidates and, if they are approved, products. In exchange, we have given them technology, product and marketing rights relating to those
products. Some of our corporate collaborators have rights to control the planning and execution of product development and clinical programs. Our collaborators may exercise their control rights in
ways that may negatively affect the timing and success of those programs. Our collaborations are subject to termination rights by the collaborators. If any of our collaborators were to terminate its
relationship with us, or fail to meet its contractual obligations, that action could have a material adverse effect on our ability to undertake research, to fund related and other programs and to
develop, manufacture and market any products that may have resulted from the collaboration. We expect to seek additional collaborative arrangements, which may not be available to us, to provide
research support and to develop and commercialize our products in the future. For example, a significant portion of our overall research effort is conducted under our research collaborations with
Novartis and Merck, both of which are scheduled to conclude in the first half of 2006. If we are unable to enter into collaborative arrangements that would extend or replace these research
collaborations, or to find other means of financing the effort currently devoted to these research programs, our ability to conduct our research, development and commercial activities could be
adversely affected to a material degree. Similarly we may choose to enter into collaborative arrangements to advance the development of some of our preclinical and clinical development stage
compounds. Even if we are able to establish acceptable collaborative arrangements in the future, they may not be successful.

IF OUR COMPETITORS BRING SUPERIOR PRODUCTS TO MARKET OR BRING THEIR PRODUCTS TO MARKET BEFORE WE DO, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

Our products in development may not be able to compete effectively with products that are currently on the market or new products that may be developed by others.
There are many other companies developing products for the same indications that we are pursuing in development. In order to compete successfully in these areas, we must demonstrate improved safety,
efficacy and ease of


manufacturing
and gain market acceptance over competing products that may receive regulatory approval before or after our products, and over those that currently are marketed. Many of our competitors,
including major pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Roche, Amgen, Boerhinger Ingelheim, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson and Schering-Plough possess substantially greater
financial, technical and human resources than we possess. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in conducting preclinical and nonclinical testing and
human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products, scaling up manufacturing operations and obtaining regulatory approvals of products and manufacturing facilities. Accordingly, our competitors may
succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for products more rapidly than we do. If we obtain regulatory approval and launch commercial sales of our products, we also will compete with respect to
manufacturing efficiency and sales and marketing capabilities, areas in which we currently have limited experience.

IF WE FAIL TO EXPAND OUR HUMAN RESOURCES AND MANAGE OUR GROWTH EFFECTIVELY, OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.

We expect that if our clinical candidates continue to progress in development, we continue to build our commercial organization and our drug discovery efforts
continue to generate drug candidates, we will require significant additional investment in personnel, management systems and resources. Our ability to commercialize our products, achieve our research
and development objectives, and satisfy our commitments under our collaboration agreements depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands and expand our internal organization to
accommodate additional anticipated growth. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.

IF WE LOSE OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE.

We believe that our integrated drug discovery capability gives us a technological advantage over our competitors. However, the pharmaceutical research field is
characterized by rapid technological progress and intense competition. As a result, we may not realize the expected benefits from these
technologies. For example, a large pharmaceutical company, with significantly more resources than we have, could pursue a systematic approach to the discovery of drugs based on gene families, using
proprietary drug targets, compound libraries, novel chemical approaches, structural protein analysis and information technologies. Such a company might identify broadly applicable compound classes
faster and more effectively than we do. Further, we believe that interest in the application of structure-based drug design, parallel drug design and related approaches has accelerated as the
strategies have become more widely understood. Businesses, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are conducting research to develop
technologies that may compete with those we use. It is possible that our competitors could acquire or develop technologies that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive. For example, a
competitor could develop information technologies that accelerate the atomic-level analysis of potential compounds that bind to the active site of a drug target, and predict the absorption, toxicity,
and relative ease-of-synthesis of candidate compounds. If we were unable to access the same technologies at an acceptable price, our business could be adversely affected.

THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF KEY EMPLOYEES OR THE FAILURE TO HIRE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND FUTURE GROWTH.

Because our product discovery and development activities are highly technical in nature, we require the services of highly qualified and trained scientists who
have the skills necessary to conduct these activities. Our future success will depend in large part on the continued services of our key scientific and management personnel. We have entered into
employment agreements with some individuals and provide compensation-related benefits to all of our key employees that vest over time and therefore induce them to remain with us. However, the
employment agreements can be terminated by the employee on relatively short notice. The value to employees of stock-related benefits that vest


over
time—such as options and restricted stock—will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that we cannot control, and may at any point in time be
insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies.

We
face intense competition for our scientific personnel from our competitors, our collaborators and other companies throughout our industry. Moreover, the growth of local biotechnology
companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the Boston area has increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical fields, and the high
cost of living in the Boston and San Diego areas makes it difficult to attract employees from other parts of the country. A failure to retain, as well as hire, train and effectively integrate into our
organization a sufficient number of qualified scientists and professionals would negatively impact our business and our ability to grow our business. In addition, the level of funding under certain of
our collaborative agreements depends on the number of our scientists performing research under those agreements. If we cannot hire and retain the required personnel, funding received under the
agreements may be reduced.

IF OUR PATENTS DO NOT PROTECT OUR PRODUCTS, OR OUR PRODUCTS INFRINGE THIRD-PARTY PATENTS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES.

We have numerous patent applications pending in the United States, as well as foreign counterparts in other countries. Our success will depend, in significant
part, on our ability to obtain and maintain United States and foreign patent protection for our products, their uses and our processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing
the proprietary rights of third parties. We do not know whether any patents will issue from any of our patent applications or, even if patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide
us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be valuable commercially. Legal standards relating to the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims in the
pharmaceutical field are still evolving, and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims in biopharmaceutical patents or the effect of prior art on them. If we are not
able to obtain adequate patent protection, our ability to prevent competitors from making, using and selling similar products will be limited. Furthermore, our activities may infringe the claims of
patents held by third parties. Defense and prosecution of infringement or other intellectual property claims, as well as participation in other inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and
time-consuming, regardless of whether or not the outcome is favorable to us. If the outcome of any such litigation or proceeding were adverse, we could be subject to significant
liabilities to third parties, could be required to obtain licenses from third parties or could be required to cease sales of affected products, any of which outcomes could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER LEXIVA/TELZIR WILL CONTINUE TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET FOR HIV PIs OR IF BRECANAVIR, IF APPROVED, WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MARKET.

We currently receive royalties from sales of Lexiva/Telzir under our collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline and will receive product royalty payments on sales of
brecanavir, if any, if brecanavir is approved for sale. Lexiva/Telzir's share of the worldwide protease inhibitor market may decrease due to competitive forces and market dynamics. Other HIV PIs and a
number of other products, including Viread® (tenofovir dispoproxil fumerate), Sustiva® (efavirenz) and Ziagen® (abacavir) are on the market for the treatment of HIV
infection and AIDS. Other drugs are still in development by our competitors, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim and Johnson & Johnson, which may have better efficacy, fewer
side effects, easier administration and/or lower costs than Lexiva/Telzir or brecanavir. Moreover, the growth in the worldwide market for HIV PIs has, to a certain extent, occurred as a result of
early and aggressive treatment of HIV infection with a protease inhibitor-based regimen. Changes in treatment strategy, in which treatment is initiated later in the course of infection, or in which
treatment is more often initiated with a regimen that does not include a protease inhibitor, may result in reduced use of HIV PIs. As a result, the total market for HIV PIs may decline,


decreasing
the sales potential of Lexiva/Telzir and/or brecanavir. Further, although we provide education efforts related to the promotion of Lexiva/Telzir in the United States and key markets in
Europe, GlaxoSmithKline directs the majority of the marketing and sales efforts and the positioning of Lexiva/Telzir in the overall market, and we have little control over the direction or success of
those efforts. GlaxoSmithKline has the right to terminate its agreement with us without cause upon twelve months' notice, and would have no obligation to pay further royalties to us upon any such
termination.

IF PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS AND THIRD-PARTY PAYORS DO NOT ACCEPT OUR FUTURE DRUGS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE, IF ANY.

Even if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and health care payors. Physicians may
elect not to recommend our drugs for a variety of reasons including:

•

the
timing of the market introduction of competitive drugs;

•

lower
demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs;

•

lack
of cost-effectiveness;

•

lack
of availability of reimbursement from third-party payors;

•

convenience
and ease of administration;

•

prevalence
and severity of adverse side effects;

•

other
potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and

•

ineffective
marketing and distribution support.

If
our approved drugs fail to achieve market acceptance, we would not be able to generate significant revenue.

IF THE GOVERNMENT AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYORS FAIL TO PROVIDE COVERAGE AND ADEQUATE PAYMENT RATES FOR OUR FUTURE DRUGS, OUR REVENUE AND PROSPECTS FOR PROFITABILITY WILL BE
HARMED.

In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of any future drugs will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Such
third-party payors include government health programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly attempting to
contain healthcare costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover and the amounts that they will pay for these drugs. As a result,
they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our future drugs. We might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any
future drugs to such payors' satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our future drugs might not ultimately be
considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in
product development.

Reimbursement
rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost products that are
already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or services, and may reflect budgetary constraints and/or imperfections in Medicare or Medicaid data used to calculate
these rates. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government health care programs. In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress that, if
enacted, would permit more widespread importation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States, which may include importation from countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in
the United States. Such legislation, or similar regulatory changes or relaxation of laws that restrict imports of drugs from other countries, could reduce the net price we receive for our marketed
drugs.


RECENT FEDERAL LEGISLATION WILL INCREASE THE PRESSURE TO REDUCE PRICES OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PAID FOR BY MEDICARE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, IF ANY.

The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare will cover and pay for pharmaceutical products. The
legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and eventually will introduce a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs. In addition, this
legislation provides authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products,
we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we
receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy
and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.

OUR BUSINESS HAS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF INSURANCE, A PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
OUR BUSINESS.

Our business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacturing and sales and marketing of human
therapeutic products. We currently have clinical trial insurance and will seek to obtain product liability insurance prior to the sales and marketing of any of our drug candidates. However, our
insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable
to maintain current amounts of insurance coverage or obtain additional or sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect against losses that could have a material adverse effect on us. If a
claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as uncovered damages awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us.
Furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to direct significant financial and managerial resources to such defense, and adverse
publicity is likely to result.

IF WE DO NOT COMPLY WITH LAWS REGULATING THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SAFETY, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

Our research and development efforts involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our
safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these
materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace
safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials. Although we maintain workers' compensation
insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.
Due to the small amount of hazardous materials that we generate, we have determined that the cost to secure insurance coverage for environmental liability and toxic tort claims far exceeds the
benefits. Accordingly, we do not maintain any insurance to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials. Additional
federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate,
any of these laws or regulations.


WE HAVE ADOPTED ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS THAT MAY FRUSTRATE ANY ATTEMPT TO REMOVE OR REPLACE OUR CURRENT MANAGEMENT.

Our corporate charter and by-law provisions and stockholder rights plan may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential
change of control of Vertex that might be beneficial to us or our security holders. Our charter provides for staggered terms for the members of the Board of Directors. Our by-laws grant
the directors a right to adjourn annual meetings of stockholders, and certain provisions of the by-laws may be amended only with an 80% stockholder vote. Pursuant to our stockholder rights
plan, each share of common stock has an associated preferred share purchase right. The rights will not trade separately from the common stock until, and are exercisable only upon, the acquisition or
the potential acquisition through tender offer by a person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. We may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without
stockholder approval and upon such terms as our Board of Directors may determine. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the
holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. As a result, stockholders or other parties may find it more difficult to remove or replace our current management.

OUR STOCK PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE BASED ON FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

Market prices for securities of companies such as Vertex are highly volatile. Within the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, our common stock traded
between $8.61 and $29.24 per share. The market for our stock, like that of other companies in the biotechnology field, has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that
are unrelated to our operating performance. The future market price of our securities could be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as:

•

announcements
of results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies;

•

announcements
of financial results and other operating performance measures, or capital structuring activities;

•

technological
innovations or the introduction of new products by our competitors;

•

government
regulatory action;

•

public
concern as to the safety of products developed by others;

•

developments
in patent or other intellectual property rights or announcements relating to these matters;

•

developments
in domestic and international governmental policy or regulation, for example relating to intellectual property rights; and

•

developments
relating specifically to other companies and market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in general.

OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR REDUCE OUR FLEXIBILITY TO ACT IN OUR BEST INTERESTS.

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due in
September 2007 ("2007 Notes") and approximately $118.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due in February 2011
("2011 Notes") outstanding. The high level of our indebtedness will affect us by:

•

exposing
us to fixed rates of interest, which may be in excess of prevailing market rates;

•

making
it more difficult to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;


•

constraining
our ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic climate or to changes in our business or the pharmaceutical industry; and

•

requiring
the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow to service of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for
other purposes.

OUR ESTIMATES OF OUR LIABILITY UNDER OUR KENDALL SQUARE LEASE MAY BE INACCURATE.

We leased a 290,000 square foot facility in Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts in January 2003 for a 15-year term. Under the lease, we are required
to complete certain build-outs and improvements of the facility. We currently expect to occupy approximately 120,000 square feet of the facility. We have sublease arrangements in place for the
remaining rentable square footage of the facility. In determining our obligations under the lease for the portion of the facility that we do not expect to occupy, we have made certain assumptions
relating to the costs that will be incurred to satisfy our
build-out commitments under the lease, operating costs, the time necessary to sublease the space after the expiration of the initial subleases, projected future sublease rental rates and
the anticipated durations of future subleases. Our estimates have changed in the past, and may change in the future, resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of liability, and the effect of
any such adjustments could be material.

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OR LITIGATION AGAINST OUR COLLABORATORS COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.

The federal government, certain state governments and private payors are investigating and have begun to file actions against numerous pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies alleging that the reporting of prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in a false and overstated Average Wholesale Price, or AWP, which in turn is alleged to have
improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by Medicare beneficiaries, insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans and others to health care providers who prescribed and administered those
products. Some payors are also alleging that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are not reporting their "best price" to the states under the Medicaid program. In addition, recent government
litigation against pharmaceutical companies has focused on allegations of off-label promotion in connection with the filing of false claims for government reimbursement. In any AWP cases or other
cases brought by the government where our collaborators or licensees are named as defendants with respect to any products licensed from us, the outcome of the case could have a material adverse effect
on our financial results.

SALES OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.

Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common
stock. In addition, the issuance of common stock upon exercise of any outstanding option or the conversion of any of our outstanding convertible debt would be dilutive, and may cause the market price
for a share of our common stock to decline. As of December 31, 2005, we had 108,153,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. We also had outstanding options to purchase
approximately 14,669,000 shares of common stock with exercise prices as set forth in Note N, "Common and Preferred Stock," to our consolidated financial statements included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, and with a weighted average exercise price of $22.84 per share. Our outstanding notes were convertible into approximately 8,354,000 shares of common
stock with a weighted average conversion price of $19.16 per share. Outstanding options and convertible notes may be exercised or converted, as the case may be, if the market price of our common stock
exceeds the applicable exercise or conversion price.


ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

We have not received any written comments that have not been resolved from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

We lease an aggregate of approximately 624,000 square feet of laboratory and office space in six facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The leases have
expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2018. We have the option to extend the lease for our headquarters facility at 130 Waverly Street, Cambridge, for one additional term of five years, ending in
2015, with respect to one portion of the building, and for up to two additional terms of five years, ending in 2019, for the other portion of the building. The lease for the laboratory and office
building at 200 Sidney Street, located adjacent to our headquarters, will expire in 2010. We have the option to extend that lease for up to two additional consecutive ten-year terms.

The
lease for our Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts facility will expire in 2018. We have the option to extend that lease for two consecutive terms of ten years each. We have
subleased approximately 145,000 square feet of the facility, and we intend to begin using the balance of the facility in the first half of 2006. The subleases are for terms ending in 2011 and 2012
with extension options to 2015 and 2018. One of the subleases has certain termination provisions beginning in 2010.

We
also lease approximately 81,200 square feet of laboratory and office space in San Diego, California. The lease for this space will expire on August 31, 2008. We have the option
to extend this lease for up to two additional terms of five years each.

We
lease approximately 22,000 square feet of laboratory and office space in Milton Park, Abingdon, England, for our United Kingdom business and research and development activities under
a lease expiring in 2013 with a right of early termination exercisable by us in 2008.

We
believe our facilities are adequate for our current needs.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are not a party to any material legal proceedings. We are not a party to any litigation in any court with any governmental authority, and management is not
aware of any contemplated proceeding by any governmental authority against the Company.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

On
July 18, 2001, we completed a merger with Aurora Biosciences Corporation. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests. All prior period
consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to include the consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Aurora as though the merger had been in effect on
the dates indicated.

(1)

In
the third quarter of 2001, in connection with our overall review of accounting policies concurrent with our merger with Aurora, we elected to change our revenue recognition policy
for collaborative and other research and development revenues from the Emerging Issues Task Force No. 91-6 ("EITF 91-6") method to the Substantive Milestone Method,
adopted retroactive to January 1, 2001. We believe this method is preferable because it is reflective of our on-going business operations and is more consistent with industry
practice following the implementation of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101") in 2000 throughout
the biotechnology industry.

(2)

We
sold certain assets and liabilities of our Discovery Tools and Services business in two independent transactions in March and December 2003. In October 2001, the FASB
issued FASB 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"). Pursuant to SFAS 144, the Statement of Operations data shown above give effect to the
disposition of the assets sold, accounting for such assets as discontinued operations. The results of discontinued operations prior to 2002 have been prepared using estimates and assumptions we deemed
appropriate based upon information currently available and does not necessarily reflect the results that would have been achieved had the business operated on a stand-alone basis for the periods
presented. Prior to 2002, the Discovery Tools and Services business was not separately managed, operationally or financially. Please refer to Note C, "Sale of Assets", in the notes to our
consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

(3)

During
2001, we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of Derivative Implementation Group Issue No. A17 ("DIG A17") in connection with
the valuation of derivative instruments.

(4)

During
2004, we issued approximately $232.4 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due in February 2011 ("2011 Notes") in
exchange for an equal principal amount of our outstanding 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due in September 2007 ("2007 Notes").

(5)

In
the third quarter of 2005, holders of 2007 Notes exchanged $40.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2007 Notes, plus interest, for approximately
2.5 million shares of newly issued common stock. As a result of this exchange, a non-cash charge of approximately $36.3 million was incurred. In separate transactions, in the
fourth quarter 2005, holders of 2011 Notes exchanged $114.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2011 Notes, plus interest, for approximately 8.1 million shares
of newly issued common stock. As a result of this exchange, a non-cash charge of approximately $11.9 million was incurred. These charges relate to the incremental shares issued in
the transactions over the number of shares that would have been issued upon conversion of the notes at the conversion prices set forth therein.


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We are a biotechnology company in the business of discovering, developing and commercializing small molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases. We have
built a drug discovery capability that integrates biology, chemistry, biophysics, automation and information technologies, with a goal of making the drug discovery process more efficient and
productive. We have a number of drug candidates in development, including compounds targeting HCV infection, RA, cystic fibrosis, cancer, pain and HIV infection. Our corporate strategy is to retain
principal responsibility for the development and commercialization of some of our proprietary drug candidates in certain major markets, concentrating a significant part of our overall development and
commercialization resources on those drug candidates once we select them. We intend to rely on collaborators to conduct development and commercialization of certain of our other drug candidates either
worldwide or in markets upon which we are not currently focused. We are concentrating most of our drug development resources at the present time on three compounds: VX-950 for the treatment of HCV
infection, VX-702 for the treatment of RA, and VX-770 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.

Drug Discovery and Development

Discovery and development of a single new pharmaceutical product is a lengthy and resource-intensive process, which may take 10 to 15 years or more. Throughout
this entire process, potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluation, driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations, designed to generate information concerning efficacy, proper
dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a proposed drug candidate should be approved for marketing. The toxicity
characteristics and profile of drug candidates at varying dose levels administered for varying periods of time also are monitored continually and evaluated during the nonclinical and clinical
development process. Most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into formal development, and most drug candidates that do advance into formal development
never become commercial products. A drug
candidate's failure to progress or advance may be the result of any one or more of a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes including, for example, the lack of acceptable absorption
characteristics or other physical properties, the lack of sufficient efficacy against the disease target, difficulties in developing a cost-effective manufacturing or formulation method,
or the discovery of toxicities or side effects that are unacceptable for the disease indication being treated.

We
have a variety of drug candidates in clinical development and a broad-based drug discovery effort. Given the uncertainties of the research and development process, it is not possible
to predict with confidence which, if any, of these efforts will result in a marketable pharmaceutical product. We constantly monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical and
clinical trials and regularly evaluate our portfolio investments with the objective of balancing risk and potential return in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights. This
process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information becomes available and we gain additional insights into ongoing programs and potential new programs.

Business Strategy

We have elected to diversify our research and development activities across a relatively broad array of investment opportunities, due in part to the high risks
associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical business. We plan to expend significant resources on development and commercialization of some of our drug product candidates in certain markets,
and rely on collaborators to conduct development and commercialization of certain of our other drug candidates either worldwide or in markets upon which we are not currently focused. This
diversification strategy requires more significant financial resources than would be required if we pursued a more limited approach.


Because
we have incurred losses from our inception and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, we are dependent in large part on our continued ability to raise significant
funding to finance our discovery and development operations and our overhead and to meet our long term contractual commitments and obligations. In the past, we have secured funds principally through
capital market transactions, strategic collaborative agreements, proceeds from the disposition of assets, investment income and the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs. At
December 31, 2005, we had $407.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, $42.1 million in principal amount of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due
2007 (the "2007 Notes") and $118.0 million in principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 (the "2011 Notes"). During 2005, we took a number of steps that we believe
reinforced our ability to implement our business strategy. In June 2005, we completed a public equity offering and issued approximately 13.5 million shares of our common stock, resulting
in net proceeds to us of approximately $165.4 million. In September 2005, we exchanged approximately 2.5 million newly issued shares of common stock for approximately
$40.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2007 Notes, plus accrued interest, and in December 2005, we exchanged approximately 8.1 million newly issued shares of common stock for
approximately $114.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2011 Notes plus accrued interest, resulting in a net
reduction by approximately $155 million of our outstanding indebtedness. During 2005, we also signed new discovery and development collaborations with GlaxoSmithKline and Avalon
Pharmaceuticals.

Collaborations and Collaborative Revenues

Collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy. We entered into two new collaborative relationships in 2005, and
extended the duration of our research collaboration with CFFT early in 2006. In February 2005, we licensed VX-944, an IMPDH inhibitor, to Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for development and
commercialization in the treatment of cancer. Avalon has made an upfront payment and has committed to make milestone payments to us, to conduct further development of VX-944 and to pay royalties to us
if VX-944 is successfully commercialized. In December 2005, we entered into a global collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline to develop and commercialize VX-409, our novel, subtype selective sodium channel
modulator for the treatment of pain. Under that collaboration agreement, GlaxoSmithKline paid us a $20 million up-front license payment, and has committed to make milestone payments to us,
conduct further development of VX-409 and any backup compounds that are selected for development, and pay us royalties on future sales of VX-409 and backup compounds. Early in 2006, we extended the
period of our research collaboration with CFFT. The amended CFFT agreement provides for an additional $22 million in continued research funding through early 2008, to further investigate our
"corrector" compounds to see if they act to restore the function of the CFTR protein. We retain the right to develop and commercialize any compounds discovered in the CFFT collaboration, and will pay
royalties to CFFT upon the approval and commercialization of any compounds discovered under the collaboration.

Our
financial guidance for 2006, as set forth below, reflects a significant increase in revenues over 2005 levels, an important part of which is anticipated revenue from new
collaborations that we believe we could enter into this year. These anticipated new collaborative revenues will be important in offsetting the loss of revenues as certain of our existing
collaborations expire in 2006. Our research collaborations with Novartis and Merck are scheduled to conclude, along with our research funding, in April and June 2006, respectively. Revenue recognized
from our Merck and Novartis collaborations accounted for approximately 61% of our total collaborative research and development revenue in 2005. We may continue to realize revenue from these
collaborations beyond their research term, in the form of milestone payments that may be earned if product candidates proceed successfully through development and royalties on sales of any resulting
drugs. We also believe that the intellectual property rights we may retain from these collaborations, as well as the value we have built in our other research and development programs, may help us
initiate other collaborative opportunities. Based on our perception of the level of interest in certain of our programs among some potential collaborators, we believe that we could enter into
additional collaborative agreements in 2006 that would be material to


our
business. Our business development priorities include new collaborations to support development and commercialization of VX-950 outside North America and to assist us with the development and
commercialization of VX-702. Our product and development pipeline also includes drug candidates such as VX-692 and VX-883 (bacterial infection), VX-166 (sepsis), VX-765 and pralnacasan (inflammatory
diseases) and VX-271 (cancer) that we may choose to develop with or through a collaborator, as we maintain focus on our core product candidates. We may also seek collaborators for our kinase, ion
channels and other research programs.

Clinical Development Programs

We are focusing our 2006 preclinical and clinical development investment on VX-950, VX-702 and VX-770. We are projecting an increase in research and development
expense for 2006 to a range of $350 million to $370 million. We expect this increase to be driven by increased clinical investment in these core programs. We believe that each of these
programs requires comprehensive investment to realize its full clinical and commercial value. We also recognize that development investment at this stage is subject to the considerable risk that any
one or more of these compounds will not advance to product registration. Each compound could fail to progress or advance due to a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes, placing our full
investment in the compound at risk. While we attempt to stage our investments to mitigate these financial risks, drug discovery and development by its nature is a very risky undertaking. We expect to
continue to evaluate and prioritize investment in our clinical development programs based on the emergence of new clinical and nonclinical data in each program in 2006 and in subsequent years.

Manufacturing and Supply Chain

We are focused on implementing the necessary infrastructure and procedures for manufacturing and supplying drug products containing VX-950, VX-702 and VX-770 for
clinical trials and ultimately for the commercial market. We currently are making a significant investment in our supply chain management, to ensure timely delivery of drug product in accordance with
all applicable regulatory guidelines. We do not currently plan to manufacture VX-950, VX-702 or VX-770 ourselves. We rely on networks of third party manufacturers and suppliers worldwide to provide
raw materials and to synthesize, tablet, and package our drug candidates for clinical trials. We currently expect that we will continue to outsource for our commercial supply requirements for our
potential products. We monitor our third party manufacturers' and suppliers' capabilities to assess their ability to meet our needs efficiently and economically. However, a delay in manufacture or
supply of clinical trial material could delay the completion of a clinical trial or compromise its results, causing a delay in the anticipated launch of a commercial product. In addition, our
significant supply chain investment could be at risk if we do not obtain favorable results in the clinical trials for any of VX-950, VX-702 or VX-770.

Financial Guidance

The key financial measures for which we have provided guidance are as follows:

Loss:

We expect that the net loss for 2006 will be in the range of $205 to $225 million. This net loss estimate includes an
estimated $34 million in stock-based compensation expense and an estimated $6 million of restructuring expense as a result of imputed interest charges relating to the restructuring
accrual.

Revenues:

We expect that the Company's revenue will be in the range of $210 to $235 million in 2006.

Research and Development ("R&D") Expense:

We expect that R&D expense will be in the range of $350 to $370 million for 2006,
including approximately $28 million of stock-based compensation expense.


Sales, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expense:

We expect our SG&A expense will be in the range of $55 to $60 million for 2006,
including approximately $6 million of stock-based compensation expense.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Available for Sale Securities:

We expect cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to be in excess of
$300 million at the end of 2006.

The
financial measures set forth above are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially, including the risks and
uncertainties that we describe in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the section below entitled "Forward-Looking Statements."

Contractual Commitments and Obligations

The first part of the following table sets forth commitments and obligations that have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
2005. Certain other obligations and commitments, while not required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") to be included in the consolidated balance sheets, may
have a material impact on liquidity. We have presented these items, all of which we have entered into in the ordinary course of business, in the table below in order to present a more complete picture
of our financial position and liquidity.

Commitments and Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005

The collaborator development loans in the table above represent indebtedness to Novartis in the amount of approximately $20.0 million that was advanced
under a loan facility established pursuant to the original collaboration agreement with Novartis. Loans under the facility were intended to fund early
clinical trials of kinase inhibitor compounds that we selected for early development. In February 2004, we amended the terms of the Novartis collaboration agreement. Under the amended
agreement, Novartis assumed responsibility for all nonclinical and clinical development of drug candidates that it accepts for development. Consequently the loan facility providing funding for
development activities by Vertex was terminated. Outstanding loans that funded amounts either spent or committed to be spent on development activities relating to compounds not selected by Novartis
will be repayable without interest in May 2008. Please refer to Note O, "Significant Revenue Arrangements", to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information regarding these loans.

At
December 31, 2005, we had $42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 2007 Notes and $118.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2011 Notes outstanding. We
are required to make


semi-annual
interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of both the 2007 and 2011 Notes. Our aggregate annual interest payment obligation is approximately $8.9 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Obligations at December 31, 2005

At December 31, 2005, our future minimum commitments and contractual obligations included facilities operating leases, a purchase obligation and
contractual commitments related to our research and development programs. These items are not required under GAAP to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. They are disclosed in the table
presented above and described more fully in the following paragraphs in order to provide a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity at December 31, 2005.

The
term under our Kendall Square lease began January 1, 2003. We began making lease payments in May 2003. We have an obligation, staged over a number of years, to build
out the leased space into finished laboratory and office space (the "Kendall Square Facility"). The lease will expire in 2018, and we have options to extend for two consecutive terms of ten years
each. The Company's future minimum commitments under the Kendall Square lease for the period commencing January 1, 2006, including lease payments and a construction obligation, are
$30.0 million for 2006, $45.5 for 2007 and 2008, $47.6 million for 2009 and 2010 and $195.7 million for the period thereafter. These amounts are included in the table above. We
expect to occupy and use for our operations approximately 40% of the Kendall Square Facility. We have entered into two subleases for the remaining rentable square footage at the Kendall Square
Facility to offset our on-going contractual lease obligations. The subleases will expire in 2011 and 2012 and contain options to extend through 2015 and 2018, respectively. One of the subleases has
certain termination provisions beginning in 2010. The future minimum committed income from the subleases is $7.4 million for 2006, $16.3 million for 2007 and 2008, $16.3 million
for 2009 and 2010 and $6.2 million for years thereafter. These amounts are not offset against our obligations set forth in the table above. See Note D, "Restructuring and Other Expense."
to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Commitments
under research and development programs represent contractual commitments entered into for materials and services in the normal course of business.

The
purchase obligation referred to above arises under our agreement to purchase a minimum of $3.0 million of products from Invitrogen Corporation annually for three years. We
made this commitment in connection with the sale of certain assets of our former Discovery Tools and Services business on March 28, 2003.

Our
table detailing contractual commitments and obligations does not include severance pay obligations to certain of our executive officers in the event of a
not-for-cause termination under existing employment contracts. The cash amount for which the Company might be liable upon any such termination, based on current executive pay
and bonus levels, could range from $0.4 to $1.4 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have incurred operating losses since our inception and historically have financed our operations principally through public and private offerings of our equity
and debt securities, strategic collaborative agreements that include research and development funding, development milestones and royalties on the sales of products, proceeds from the disposition of
assets of our Discovery Tools and Services business, investment income and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs.

At
December 31, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $407.5 million, which is an increase of $15.2 million from $392.3 million at
December 31, 2004. The increase reflects net proceeds of approximately $165.4 million from our public offering of common stock, which closed in June 2005, as well as
$32.2 million from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit


plans,
offset by the net loss of $203.4 million. Expenditures for property and equipment during the 12 months ended December 31, 2005 were $17.0 million.

As
part of our strategy to manage our long-term operating cash needs, we exchanged approximately $155.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible
subordinated notes, plus interest, in a series of transactions, for approximately 10.6 million shares of newly issued common stock. As a result of these exchanges, we incurred a
non-cash charge of approximately $48.2 million. This charge is related to the incremental shares issued in the transactions over the number that would have been issued upon
conversion of the notes under their original conversion prices. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the
2007 Notes and approximately $118.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2011 Notes outstanding. The 2011 Notes are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder at a price
equal to $14.94 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2007 Notes are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder at a price equal to $92.26 per share, subject
to adjustment under certain circumstances.

The
restructuring accrual of $43.0 million at December 31, 2005 relates to the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that we do not intend to occupy, and includes
build-out commitments and other lease obligations, recorded at net present value. In 2005, we made cash payments of $24.2 million against the accrual and received
$3.2 million in sublease rental income. We expect to make net cash payments of approximately $14.4 million against the accrual in 2006. We review our estimates underlying the
restructuring accrual on at least a quarterly basis, and the accrual, and consequently any expected future payment, could change with any change in our estimates.

The
net decrease of $33.8 million in deferred revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2005 is a result of revenue recognized in 2005 related to cash payments
received from collaborators, primarily Novartis and Merck, in previous periods, which were deferred and are being recognized over our period of performance in accordance with our revenue recognition
policy. In connection with new collaborations in 2005, we received and recognized as revenue approximately $25.0 million up-front license payments. We also received $22.0 million in
milestone payments from our collaborators during 2005. Consistent with our revenue recognition policy, we recognized approximately $10.0 million of this amount and have deferred recognition of
the majority of these milestone payment amounts, which will be recognized over our remaining period of obligation.

In
February 2004, we amended the terms of our collaboration agreement with Novartis. Under the amended agreement, Novartis assumed responsiblity for all nonclinical and clinical
development of drug candidates that it accepts for development. Consequently, the loan facility established under the original agreement, which provided funding for development activities by Vertex,
has been terminated. As permitted under the amended agreement, on June 22, 2004, we gave notice to Novartis of our election to develop VX-680 outside of our Novartis collaboration.
As a result, we repaid to Novartis approximately $12.5 million of unspent and uncommitted loan amounts relating to VX-680. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately
$20.0 million in remaining loans outstanding under the loan facility. Loans advanced by Novartis for the development of collaboration compounds under the original agreement will be forgiven on
a compound-by-compound basis if any such compounds are selected by Novartis for development. All loans not forgiven under the facility will be repayable, without interest, in
May 2008.

We
expect to continue to make significant investments in our drug candidates, particularly in clinical trials of VX-950, VX-702 and VX-770, in our ion channel and kinase discovery
efforts, in our effort to prepare for potential registration, regulatory approval and commercial launch of our product candidates and in supply chain management. Consequently, we expect to incur
losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future. We also expect to incur substantial administrative expenditures in the future and expenses related to filing, prosecution, defense
and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property rights.


In
2006 and in future periods, the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements, including repayment of the 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes, will
depend on many factors, including the number, breadth and prospects of our discovery and development programs, the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates
and our decisions regarding manufacturing and commercial investments. Collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy. We will continue to rely on cash
receipts from our existing research and development collaborations, including research funding, development reimbursements and potential milestone payments, and from new collaborations, in order to
help fund our research and development efforts.

As
part of our strategy for managing our capital structure, we have from time to time adjusted the amount and maturity of our debt obligations through new issues, privately negotiated
transactions and market purchases, depending on market conditions and our perceived needs at the time. During 2006 we expect to continue pursuing a general financial strategy that may lead us to
undertake one or more additional capital transactions. Any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past.

To
the extent that our current cash and marketable securities, in addition to the above-mentioned sources, are not sufficient to fund our activities, it will be necessary to raise
additional funds through public offerings or private placements of our securities or other methods of financing. We also will continue to manage our capital structure and consider all financing
opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. There can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on
acceptable terms, if at all.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods. These items are constantly monitored and
analyzed by management for changes in
facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. We base our estimates on
historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do
not turn out to be substantially accurate.

We
believe that the application of the accounting policies for restructuring and other expense, revenue recognition, research and development expenses and investments, all of which are
important to our financial condition and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. Our accounting polices, including the ones discussed below, are
more fully described in Note B, "Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Restructuring and Other Expense

We record liabilities associated with restructuring activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred, in accordance with
SFAS 146. As prescribed by SFAS 146, we use a probability-weighted discounted cash-flow analysis to calculate the amount of the liability. The probability-weighted discounted cash-flow
analysis is based on management's assumptions and estimates of our ongoing lease obligations, including contractual rental commitments, build-out commitments and building operating costs, and
estimates of income from subleases, based on the term and timing of such subleases. We discount the estimated cash flows using a discount rate of approximately 10%. These cash flow estimates are
reviewed and may be adjusted in subsequent periods. Adjustments are based,


among
other things, on management's assessment of changes in factors underlying the estimates. Because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the
time-value of money, the estimate will increase simply as a result of the passage of time, even if all other factors remain unchanged.

Our
estimates of our restructuring liability have changed in the past, and it is possible that our assumptions and estimates will change in the future, resulting in additional
adjustments to the amount of the estimated liability. The effect of any such adjustments could be material. For example, we currently have two subleases for portions of the Kendall Square Facility
with terms of six and seven years, respectively, and we have made certain estimates and assumptions relating to future sublease terms following the expiration of the current subleases. As a result, we
may be exposed to market variability in the future. We will review our assumptions and judgments related to the lease restructuring on at least a quarterly basis until the Kendall Square lease is
terminated, and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary, based on our best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances.

The
accrual for restructuring expense of $43.0 million at December 31, 2005 is related to the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that we do not intend to occupy. This
estimate represents our best judgment of the assumptions and estimates most appropriate in measuring the ongoing obligation.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101") as amended
by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition" ("SAB 104") and for revenue arrangements entered into after June 30, 2003, Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables" ("EITF 00-21").

Our
revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of the agreements typically include payment to Vertex of
non-refundable up-front license fees, funding of research and development efforts, milestone payments and/or royalties on product sales.

Agreements
containing multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the
customer and whether we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered obligation(s). The consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective
fair values or the residual method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units.

We
recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front license fees on a straight-line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance, which is typically the research or
development term. Research and development funding is recognized as earned, ratably over the period of effort.

Substantive
milestones are recognized as earned when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured and we have evidence of fair value for our remaining obligations. Substantive
milestones are recognized over the period of performance when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured but we do not have fair value for our remaining obligations. This typically results in a
portion of the milestone payment being recognized as revenue at the date the milestone is achieved, which portion is equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that has elapsed as of
the date the milestone is achieved, with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance. We evaluate whether milestones are substantive at the inception of the
agreement based on the contingent nature of the milestone, specifically reviewing factors such as the technological and commercial risk that must be overcome as well as the level of effort and
investment required to achieve the milestone. Milestones that are not considered substantive and do not meet the separation criteria are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a
straight-line basis over the remaining period of performance.

Payments
received after performance obligations are met completely are recognized when earned.


Royalty revenue on our products Agenerase and Lexiva/Telzir is recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories, as provided by our
collaborator GlaxoSmithKline, and is recognized in the period the sales occur. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues, which have not historically been significant,
are reconciled and adjusted for in the quarter they become known.

Research and Development Costs

All research and development costs, including amounts funded by research and development collaborations, are expensed as incurred. Research and development
expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits; laboratory supplies; contract services, including clinical trial costs; and
infrastructure costs, including facilities costs and depreciation. To record clinical trial, contract services and other outside costs, we are required to make estimates of the costs incurred in a
given accounting period and record accruals at period-end, because the third party service periods and billing terms do not always coincide with our period-end. We base our
estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service
contract, where applicable.

Altus Investment

We assess our investment in Altus Pharmaceuticals Inc., which we account for using the cost method, on a quarterly basis to determine if there has been any
estimated decrease in the fair value of that investment below its $18.9 million carrying value that might require us to write down the cost basis of the asset. If any adjustment to the fair
value of an investment reflects a decline in the value of that investment below its cost, we consider the evidence available to us, including the duration and extent to which the decline is
other-than-temporary. If the decline is considered other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of
the write-down is included in the consolidated statements of operations. We have not identified facts or circumstances which would cause us to determine that the investment basis of our
interest in Altus should be changed.

Altus
completed an initial public offering in January 2006. We own 817,749 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,962,494 shares of common stock. In addition, we hold
450,000 shares of redeemable preferred stock, which are not convertible into common stock and which are redeemable at our option on or after December 31, 2010, or by Altus at any time. We are
restricted from trading Altus securities for a period of six months following the initial public offering. Due to the public offering, in 2006 we will classify the common stock as an
available-for-sale investment and record it at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
which is a separate component of stockholders' equity, until such gains and losses are realized. We will continue to account for the warrants under the cost method of accounting until the end of the
restricted trading period, at which time the warrants will be classified as derivatives. Gains or losses on the fair market value of the warrants, as derivatives, will be included in the consolidated
statements of operations. We will continue to account for the redeemable preferred stock under the cost method of accounting.

Results of Operations

The following discussion of revenues and expenses is based only on the results of our continuing operations. We sold the assets of our Discovery Tools and
Services business in two independent transactions in March and December 2003. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS
No. 144"), the results of operations associated with the assets sold have been reclassified in the Company's consolidated financial statements under the heading "discontinued operations" for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The reclassification of the amounts to discontinued operations was accomplished using estimates and assumptions we have


deemed
appropriate based upon the information currently available. Amounts reclassified to discontinued operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been achieved had the
Discovery Tools and Services business operated on a stand-alone basis during the periods presented.

As
a result of the disposition of these assets, we now operate in a single operating segment: Pharmaceuticals.

Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2004

Our net loss for 2005 was $203,417,000, or $2.28 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss for 2004 of $166,247,000, or $2.12 per basic and
diluted common share. Our loss in 2005 includes restructuring expense of $8,134,000 and a charge of $48,213,000 for the exchange of newly issued common stock for a portion of our outstanding
convertible notes. Our loss in 2004 includes restructuring expense of $17,574,000 and a charge for the retirement of convertible notes of $3,446,000.

Our
net loss for 2005, as compared with our net loss for 2004, increased primarily as a result of increased development investment to advance our propriety drug candidates, which was
partially offset by an increase in revenue.

Total
revenues increased to $160,890,000 in 2005 compared to $102,717,000 in 2004. In 2005, revenue was comprised of $32,829,000 in royalties and $128,061,000 in collaborative and other
research and development revenues, as compared with $17,322,000 in royalties and $85,395,000 in collaborative research and development revenue in 2004.

Royalties
consist of Lexiva/Telzir (fosamprenavir calcium) and Agenerase (amprenavir) royalty revenue. Fosamprenavir calcium is marketed under the trade name Lexiva in the United States
and Telzir in the European Union. Royalty revenue is based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of Lexiva/Telzir and Agenerase. We began earning royalties on sales of Lexiva in the United
States in the fourth quarter of 2003 and on Telzir in the European Union in third quarter of 2004. The increase in royalty revenue is due to the increase in Lexiva/Telzir sales. By the end of
2005, Lexiva had largely replaced Agenerase in worldwide markets. As a result, we expect that royalty revenue in the foreseeable future will consist primarily of Lexiva/Telzir royalty revenue. We pay
a royalty to a third party on sales of Agenerase and Lexiva/Telzir.

Collaborative
and other research and development revenues increased $42,666,000, or 50%, in 2005 as compared with 2004. The increase in collaborative and other research and development
revenues is due to the execution of new collaboration agreements in 2004 and in 2005. In 2005 we entered into collaboration agreements with Avalon Pharmaceuticals (license, development
and commercialization of VX-944) and GlaxoSmithKline (research, license, development and commercialization of VX-409). Under these new collaboration agreements, in 2005 we
earned $5,000,000 in up-front license fees from Avalon and $20,000,000 in up-front license fees from GlaxoSmithKline. In 2004 we entered into collaboration agreements with CFFT (cystic fibrosis drug
discovery), Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation (Far East development and commercialization of VX-950), and Merck (research, development and commercialization of Aurora kinase inhibitors,
including VX-680 and VX-667). We recognized revenue of approximately $7,339,000 in 2005 from two milestone payments made by Merck in our Aurora kinase inhibitor collaboration, one
made in connection with Merck's selection of VX-667 as a follow-on compound to VX-680, and one for demonstrating that administration of VX-680 to patients had an effect on a clinically relevant
biomarker, in an aggregate amount of $19.5 million. We earned $2.5 million in milestone revenue from Kissei related to the completion of regulatory filings in preparation for
Phase I clinical development of VX-702 in Japan.

Research
and development expenses increased $56,378,000, or 29%, to $248,540,000 in 2005, from $192,162,000 in 2004. The increase in research and development expenses in 2005 as compared
with 2004 is primarily a result of investment in our clinical development programs for VX-950 and VX-702. Development expenses accounted for 87%, or $48,875,000, of the aggregate increase in research
and development expenses. In 2005 we incurred costs from Phase II-enabling activities for VX-950, we completed enrollment in a 315-patient Phase II clinical trial of VX-702 for
the treatment of RA, and we continued a Phase IIb clinical trial (called the "METRO" trial) of merimepodib (VX-497) for the treatment of HCV infection. We initiated the METRO trial
during 2004. During 2004 we also completed a Phase Ia trial of VX-950, and began a Phase Ib evaluation of VX-950 in patients with chronic HCV infection. During the fourth
quarter of 2004 we commenced Phase II clinical development of VX-765 in psoriasis.

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits, laboratory supplies, contractual services and infrastructure costs, including facilities costs and
depreciation. Set forth below

To date we have incurred in excess of $1 billion in research and development costs associated with drug discovery and development. We expect research and
development expenses in 2006 to be greater than in 2005 due to increased investment in clinical development as we advance our core programs. In 2006, we expect to focus our preclinical and
clinical development investment on VX-950, VX-702 and VX-770. However, our anticipated 2006 research and development expenses could vary materially from our projections, depending on the occurrence
and timing of clinical trials and actual clinical trial
results. We expect that our combined research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we add personnel and capabilities to support the advancement of our lead drug candidates. We
do not expect that our research expenses will increase significantly unless we obtain a significant amount of funding from new research collaborations.

We
estimate that it takes 10 to 15 years, or possibly longer, to discover, develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the U.S. as outlined below:

Phase:

Objective:

Estimated

Duration:

Discovery

Lead identification and target validation

2 to 4 years

Preclinical

Initial toxicology for preliminary identification of risks for humans; gather early pharmacokinetic data

1 to 2 years

Phase I

Evaluate safety in humans; study how the drug works, metabolizes and interacts with other drugs

1 to 2 years

Phase II

Establish effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage; continue safety evaluation

2 to 4 years

Phase III

Confirm efficacy, dosage regime and safety profile of the drug; submit New Drug Application

2 to 4 years

FDA approval

Approval by the FDA to sell and market the drug for the approved indication

6 months to 2 years


Animal
and other nonclinical studies typically are conducted during each phase of human clinical trials.

The
successful development of our products is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk factors. The duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type,
complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. The FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products,
typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Data obtained from preclinical,
nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity. Data obtained from these activities also are
susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The duration and cost of discovery, preclinical, nonclinical and clinical trials may vary significantly
over the life of a project and are difficult to predict. Therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available. The most
significant costs associated with drug discovery and development are those costs associated with Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. Given the uncertainties related to development, we are
currently unable to reliably estimate when, if ever, our drug candidates will generate revenue and net cash inflows.

Sales,
general and administrative expenses increased $1,851,000, or 4%, to $43,990,000 in 2005 from $42,139,000 in 2004.

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, we recorded net restructuring expense of $8.1 million. This net expense includes a $10.0 million credit to the
restructuring accrual made when we decided in mid-2005 to occupy and use a portion of the Kendall Square Facility for our operations, which was offset by (i) the estimated incremental net
ongoing lease obligations associated with the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that we do not intend to occupy and (ii) imputed interest costs relating to the restructuring liability.

In
accordance with SFAS 146, we review our estimates and assumptions with respect to the Kendall Square lease on at least a quarterly basis, and will make whatever modifications
we believe necessary until the termination of the lease, based on our best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances. Our estimates have changed in the past, and may change in the future,
resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of liability, and the effect of any such adjustments could be material. Because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount
rate to reflect the time-value of money, the estimate of the liability will increase each quarter simply as a result of the passage of time.

Interest
income increased approximately $1,671,000 to $11,994,000 in 2005 from $10,323,000 in 2004. The increase is mainly the result of higher returns on invested funds.


Interest
expense decreased $991,000 or 5% to $17,326,000 in 2005 from $18,317,000 in 2004 as a result of the exchange of newly issued stock for a portion of our outstanding
convertible debt in the second half of 2005.

In
addition, as a result of the issuance during 2005 of common stock in exhange for convertible subordinated notes, we recorded a non-cash charge of $48,213,000. This charge relates to
the incremental shares issued in the transactions over the number of shares that would have been issued upon the conversion of the notes under their original terms.

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2003

Our net loss for 2004 was $166,247,000, or $2.12 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss for 2003 of $196,767,000, or $2.56 per basic and
diluted common share. Our loss in 2004 includes restructuring and other expense of $17,574,000 and a charge for the retirement of convertible notes of $3,446,000. Our loss in 2003 includes
restructuring and other expense of $91,824,000 and income from discontinued operations of $69,646,000. Included in the income from discontinued operations is a gain from the sale of assets of
$70,339,000.

Our
net loss for 2004, as compared with our net loss for 2003, decreased primarily as a result of increased revenue, principally related to new collaboration agreements and increased
royalties.

Total
revenues increased to $102,717,000 in 2004 compared to $69,141,000 in 2003. In 2004, revenue was comprised of $17,322,000 in royalties and $85,395,000 in collaborative and other
research and development revenues, as compared with $9,002,000 in royalties and $60,139,000 in collaborative research and development revenues in 2003.

Royalties
consist of Lexiva/Telzir (fosamprenavir calcium) and Agenerase (amprenavir) royalty revenue. Fosamprenavir calcium is marketed under the trade name Lexiva in the United States
and Telzir in the European Union. Royalty revenue is based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of Lexiva/Telzir and Agenerase. We began earning royalties on sales of Lexiva in the United
States in the fourth quarter of 2003 and on Telzir in the European Union in the third quarter of 2004.

Collaborative
and other research and development revenues increased $25,256,000, or 42%, in 2004 as compared with 2003. The increase in collaborative and other research and development
revenues is due to the execution of new collaboration agreements and recognition of revenue in the amount of approximately $4.1 million from a $10 million milestone payment made in
connection with Novartis' selection of VX-322 for development. We also earned $2,500,000 in milestone revenue from GlaxoSmithKline relating to regulatory approval of Telzir in the European
Union and the initiation of Phase II clinical trials for brecanavir (VX-385). The table presented below is a summary of revenue from collaborative arrangements for the year ended 2004 as
compared with the year ended 2003.

Development expenditures were $78,886,000 in 2004 compared with $86,201,000 in 2003. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2004 as compared with 2003 is a result of our decision to
focus during


on development activities aimed at new treatments for viral and inflammatory diseases. In 2003, we engaged in development activities with drug candidates targeting potential therapeutic
indications other than viral and inflammatory diseases, including VX-944 (oncology), which is now licensed to Avalon and VX-680 (oncology), which is now licensed to Merck.
During 2004, we initiated the METRO trial. We completed a Phase Ia trial of VX-950, also for the treatment of HCV infection, and began a Phase Ib evaluation of VX-950 in
patients with chronic HCV infection. During the fourth quarter of 2004 we also commenced Phase II clinical development of VX-765 in psoriasis.

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits, laboratory supplies, contractual services and infrastructure costs, including facilities costs and

Sales,
general and administrative expenses increased $3,057,000, or 8%, to $42,139,000 in 2004 from $39,082,000 in 2003. The increase is partially attributable to increased professional
consulting expenses incurred to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as increased costs related to the further development of our patent portfolio and increased business development
costs associated with the pursuit of new collaborative relationships.

Restructuring
and other expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $17.6 million. The expense recorded during 2004 reflects a revision of our key estimates
and assumptions, specifically relating to the projected sublease rental rates and timing of subleases, as well as the imputed interest cost related to the restructuring accrual.

income decreased approximately $5,089,000 to $10,323,000 in 2004 from $15,412,000 in 2003. The decrease is the result of both a lower level of invested funds and lower portfolio
yields due to a reduced interest rate environment.

In
connection with the sale of the assets of our Discovery Tools and Services business in 2003 we recorded income from discontinued operations of $69,646,000. Included in this amount is
a gain on the sale of those assets of $70,339,000.

Any
or all of our forward-looking statements in this Annual Report may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and
uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in our discussion in this Annual Report will be important in determining future results. While management makes its best efforts to be accurate in making forward-
looking statements, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially, including the cautionary information set forth under the heading
"Risk Factors" appearing in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results. Other
factors besides those listed there could also adversely affect us. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments" ("FASB 123(R)"). FASB
123(R) revises FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("FASB 123"), supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
("APB 25") and amends FASB Statement No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." FASB 123(R) requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based
compensation over the employees' service periods. Compensation cost is measured at the fair value of the award at the grant date and is adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures and the outcome of
certain conditions. The fair value of an award is not re-measured after its initial estimation on the grant date.

We
are required to comply with FASB 123(R) beginning January 1, 2006 (the "Effective Date"). We will apply the Modified Prospective Method of adoption in our application of
FASB 123(R). Under this method, compensation cost is recognized beginning with the Effective Date (a) based on application of the requirements of FASB 123(R) to all share-based
payments granted after the effective date; and (b) based on application of the requirements of FASB 123 to all awards granted to employees prior to the Effective Date of
FASB 123(R) that remain unvested on the Effective Date.

As
permitted by FASB 123, we currently account for share-based payments to employees using APB 25's intrinsic value method, and therefore generally recognize no
compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of FASB 123(R)'s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations, although it will have no
impact on our overall financial position. In 2006 we
expect to record approximately $34 million in compensation expense in connection with the adoption of FASB 123(R). The impact of adoption of FASB 123(R) beyond fiscal 2006
cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on our stock price and the amount of share-based awards granted in future periods, as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation
assumptions, including, but not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors. However, had we adopted FASB 123(R) in prior periods, the impact
would have approximated the effect of FASB 123 as described in "Stock-Based Compensation" found in Note B to our consolidated financial statements.

In
May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections" ("SFAS 154"). SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20,
"Accounting Changes" and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements." SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial
statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impractible to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS
No. 154 on January 1, 2006 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
November 2005, FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and
Its Application to Certain Investments" ("FSP FAS 115-1"), which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are


considered
impaired, whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, and on measuring such impairment loss. FSP FAS 115-1 also includes accounting
considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as
other-than-temporary impairments. FSP FAS 115-1 is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We are required to adopt
FSP FAS 115-1 in the first quarter of 2006. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As part of our investment portfolio, we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks. The investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital
until it is required to fund operations, including our research and development activities. None of these market risk-sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes. We do not have derivative
financial instruments in our investment portfolio.

Interest Rate Risk

We invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments, principally securities issued by the United States government and its agencies, investment grade
corporate bonds and notes and money market instruments. These investments are denominated in United States dollars. All of our interest-bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk, and could
decline in value if interest rates fluctuate. Substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio
liquidity, and Vertex has implemented guidelines limiting the term-to-maturity of its investment instruments. Due to the conservative nature of these instruments, we do not
believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The information required by this Item 8 is contained on pages F-3 through F-39 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(1)    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The Company's chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, have concluded that, based on such evaluation, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, the Company's management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

(2)    Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

The management of Vertex is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and
Rule 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's principal executive and principal financial
officers and effected by the Company's Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for


external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

•

provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detections of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The
Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, it used the
criteria set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, we have concluded that,
as of December 31, 2005, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Our
management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated below.

(3)    Changes in Internal Controls.

In connection with our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2005, we did not change such internal control in a manner that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

(4) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Incorporated as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the year ended December 31,
2005 of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and our report dated March 8, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated as of December 31, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated at
December 31, 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 8, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

A. The Company

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated ("Vertex" or the "Company") is a biotechnology company in the business of discovering, developing and commercializing small
molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases. The Company intends to continue investing in and building capabilities in research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products
while it advances its product candidates to market. Vertex earns royalty revenues from the sale of Lexiva/Telzir (fosamprenavir calcium), a Vertex-discovered product for the treatment of HIV
infection, and conducts certain educational activities for this product in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline plc.

The
Company's corporate strategy is to retain principal responsibility for the development and commercialization of some of its proprietary drug candidates in certain major markets,
concentrating a significant part of its overall development and commercialization resources on those drug candidates. Vertex intends to rely on collaborators to conduct development and
commercialization of certain of its other drug candidates either worldwide or in markets upon which the Company is not currently focused. The Company is concentrating most of its drug development
resources at the present time on three compounds: VX-950 for the treatment of HCV infection; VX-702 for the treatment of RA; and VX-770 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.

Collaborations
are a key component of Vertex's corporate strategy. Collaborations provide Vertex with financial support and other valuable resources for its research programs,
development resources for its clinical drug candidates, and marketing and sales support for its products and product candidates. Vertex currently has drug candidates in development under
collaborations with GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck & Co., Inc., Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated, Novartis Pharma AG, Mitsubishi Pharma Corp., Kissei Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd., and Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Vertex
is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, rapid technological change and competition, uncertain protection of
proprietary technology, clinical trial uncertainty, dependence on collaborative relationships, share price volatility, the need to obtain additional funding, uncertainties relating to pharmaceutical
pricing and reimbursement, limited experience in manufacturing, sales and marketing, potential product liability and the need to comply with government regulations. The Company expects to incur
operating losses for the foreseeable future, as a result of expenditures for its research and development programs.

B. Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

The
assets of the Company's Discovery Tools and Services business sold in March 2003 and December 2003 represent a component of Vertex's business that, beginning in 2002,
had separately identifiable cash flows. As such, pursuant to SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144"), the consolidated statements
of operations and of cash flows have been restated to show the results of operations and cash flows of the assets sold as discontinued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003.
Please refer to Note C, "Sale of Assets," for further information.

All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

F-7

The
Company operates in one segment, Pharmaceuticals, and all revenues are from United States operations.

Reclassification in the Preparation of Financial Statements

Certain amounts in prior years' financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The Company reclassified certain marketable
securities on the 2004 consolidated balance sheets as long-term assets to conform to the 2005 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported net loss.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include restructuring and other
expense, revenue recognition, research and development expenses and investments. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents consist principally of money market funds, municipal bonds, and debt securities. Changes in cash and cash equivalents may be effected by shifts in investment portfolio maturities as well
as by actual cash receipts and disbursements.

Marketable Securities

Marketable securities consist of investments in high-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, municipal bond securities and U.S. government
agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable securities available to fund current operations as current assets on the balance
sheet. Marketable securities are classified as long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets if (i) they have been in an unrealized loss position for longer than one year and
(ii) the Company has the ability to hold them (a) until the carrying value is recovered and (b) such holding period may be longer than one year. Marketable securities are stated
at fair value with their unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of stockholders' equity, until such gains and losses
are realized. The fair value of these securities is based on quoted market prices. If a decline in the fair value is considered other-than-temporary, based on available
evidence, the unrealized loss is transferred from other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statement of operations. There were no write-downs of marketable securities in 2005, 2004 or 2003.
Realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method and are included in interest income.

F-8

Investments

Investments at December 31, 2005 and 2004 include long-term investments recorded using the cost method of accounting. When the Company holds an ownership
interest of less than 20%, and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investment entity's operating activities, the Company accounts for its investment using the cost
method. If any adjustment to the fair value of an investment reflects a decline in the value of that investment below its cost, the Company considers the evidence available to it, including the
duration and extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other-than-temporary. If the decline is
considered other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down is included in
the Company's consolidated statements of operations. There were no write-downs of investment in 2005 or 2004.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of money market funds and marketable securities.
The Company places these investments in highly rated financial institutions, and, by policy, limits the amounts of credit exposure to any one financial institution. These amounts at times may exceed
federally insured limits. The Company has not
experienced any credit losses in these accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds. The Company has no foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or
other foreign exchange hedging arrangements.

To
date, the Company's revenue has been generated from a limited number of customers in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries in the U.S., Europe and Japan. In 2005 the
Company had significant revenue transactions with Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck which accounted for 33%, 33% and 15% respectively, of the Company's total revenue. In 2004, revenue transactions
with Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline accounted for 49% and 19%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue. In 2003, revenue transactions with Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline represented 64% and 17%,
respectively, of the Company's total revenue.

Receivables
from GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis represented approximately 46% and 22%, respectively, of the Company's accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2005. Receivables
from GlaxoSmithKline and Mitsubishi represented approximately 46% and 15%, respectively, of the Company's accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2004. Management believes that credit risks
associated with these collaborators are not significant.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the lesser of the lease
terms or the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally four to seven years for furniture and equipment and three to five years for computers and software. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the improvements or the remaining life of the lease. Major additions and betterments are capitalized; maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or
extend the life of the respective assets, are charged to operations. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related allowances for depreciation and amortization are
eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

F-9

Long-Lived Assets

The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"). In accordance with SFAS No. 144, management assesses the potential impairments
of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. If the
carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset the Company writes down the asset to its estimated fair value.

Stock-Based Compensation

In accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure"
("SFAS 148"), for periods prior to January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123") and also applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and related
interpretations in accounting for all stock awards granted to employees. Under APB 25, provided that other criteria are met, when the exercise price of options or the issue price of restricted shares
granted to employees equals the market price of the common stock on the date of the grant, no compensation cost is required.

At
December 31, 2005, the Company had one Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") and three stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note N,
"Common and Preferred Stock." For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $4,421,000, $1,661,000 and $16,000, respectively, in net compensation expense related to
restricted shares issued to employees. The net expense of $4,421,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 included approximately $840,000 of expense related to the accelerated vesting
of restricted stock awards in accordance with executives' severance agreements. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded $211,000 in compensation expense related
to stock and option grants in accordance with executives' severance agreements. No additional stock-based employee compensation cost related to stock options is reflected in the Company's reported net
loss, as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. For stock options granted to
non-employees, the Company recognizes compensation costs in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 123, which requires that companies recognize compensation expense for grants of
stock, stock options and other equity instruments based on fair value.

The
following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per share if the fair value recognition of SFAS 123 had been applied to the Company's stock-based employee
compensation. Employee stock-based compensation expense is amortized on a staight-line basis, as our valuation of options subject to SFAS 123 assumes a single weighted-average expected-life for each
award.

F-10

Assumptions
used to calculate the fair value of employee stock based compensation are detailed in Note N, "Common and Preferred Stock."

Restructuring and Other Expense

The Company records costs and liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities, as defined in Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146,
"Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"), at fair value in the period the liability is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, changes to
a liability are measured using the credit-adjusted risk-free discount rate applied in the initial period. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded costs and liabilities for exit and
disposal activities related to a restructuring plan in accordance with SFAS 146. The liability is evaluated and adjusted as appropriate on at least a quarterly basis for changes in
circumstances. Please refer to Note D, "Restructuring and Other Expense," for further information.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"), as amended by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," ("SAB 104") and for revenue arrangements entered into after
June 30, 2003, Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables" ("EITF 00-21").

The
Company's revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of the agreements typically include payment to
Vertex of non-refundable up-front license fees, funding of research and development efforts, milestone payments and/or royalties on product sales.

Agreements
containing multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the
customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered obligation(s). The consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective
fair values or the residual method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units.

The
Company recognizes revenues from non-refundable, up-front license fees on a straight-line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance, which is typically the
research or

F-11

development
term. Research and development funding is recognized as earned, ratably over the period of effort.

Substantive
milestones are recognized as earned when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured and the Company has evidence of fair value for its remaining obligations. Substantive
milestones are recognized over the period of performance when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured but the Company does not have fair value for its remaining obligations. This typically
results in a portion of the milestone payment being recognized as revenue at the date the milestone is achieved, which portion is equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that has
elapsed as of the date the milestone is achieved, with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance. The Company evaluates whether milestones are substantive at
the inception of the agreement based on the contingent nature of the milestone, specifically reviewing factors such as the technological risk that must be overcome as well as the level of effort and
investment required to achieve the milestone. Milestones that are not considered substantive and do not meet the separation criteria are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a
straight-line basis over the remaining period of performance.

Payments
received after performance obligations are met completely are recognized when earned.

Royalty
revenue is recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by the licensee and is recognized in the period the sales
occur. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues, which have not historically been significant, are reconciled and adjusted for in the quarter they become known.

Research and Development Costs

All research and development costs, including amounts funded by research collaborators, are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses are comprised
of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and benefits; laboratory supplies; contract services, including clinical trial costs; and infrastructure costs,
including facilities costs and depreciation. The Company's collaborators have agreed to fund portions of the Company's research and development programs related to specific research targets and drug
candidates, including, in 2005, VX-950, VX-702, kinases and certain cystic fibrosis research targets; in 2004, VX-950, kinases, caspase inhibitors, and certain cystic fibrosis research
targets; and in 2003, VX-702, kinases, caspase inhibitors, and certain cystic fibrosis research targets. The following table details the aggregate amount of research and development expenses
for the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (in thousands) for programs that are funded, in total or in part, by collaborators ("Collaborator-sponsored") and for programs
that the Company funds entirely with its own resources ("Company-sponsored"):

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the income tax bases of

F-12

assets
and liabilities. A valuation allowance is applied against any net deferred tax asset if, based on the weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized.

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs incurred to complete Vertex's convertible subordinated note offerings are deferred and included in other assets on the consolidated balance
sheets. The costs are amortized based on the effective interest method over the term of the related debt issuance. The amortization expense is included in interest expense on the consolidated
statements of operations. Unamortized costs related to exchanged debt is reversed from other assets to additional paid-in capital.

Stock Offering Costs

Expenses incurred in connection with common stock issuances are recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.

Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss consists of net loss and other comprehensive loss, which includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
certain marketable securities. For purposes of comprehensive loss disclosures, the Company does not record tax provisions or benefits for the net changes in foreign currency translation adjustment, as
the Company intends to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiary.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiary is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary are re-measured
into U.S. dollars at rates of exchange in effect at the end of the year. Revenue and expense amounts are re-measured using the average exchange rates for the period. Net unrealized gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are included in other comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of stockholders' equity. Included in other comprehensive loss is a net
unrealized loss related to foreign currency translation of $18,000 at December 31, 2005 and a net unrealized gain related to foreign currency translation of $613,000 at December 31,
2004.

Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share

Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus additional weighted average common equivalent shares outstanding during the period when the effect is not
anti-dilutive. Common equivalent shares result from the exercise of outstanding stock options (the proceeds of which are then assumed to have been used to repurchase outstanding stock
using the treasury stock method), the assumed conversion of convertible notes and the vesting of unvested restricted shares of common stock. Common equivalent shares have not been included in the net
loss per share calculations because their effect would have

F-13

been
anti-dilutive. Total potential gross common equivalent shares consisted of the following (in thousands, except per share amounts):

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments" ("FASB 123(R)"). FASB
123(R) revises FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("FASB 123"), supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
("APB 25") and amends FASB Statement No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." FASB 123(R) requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based
compensation over the employees' service periods. Compensation cost is measured at the fair value of the award at the grant date and is adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures and the outcome of
certain conditions. The fair value of an award is not re-measured after its initial estimation on the grant date.

Vertex
is required to comply with FASB 123(R) beginning January 1, 2006 (the "Effective Date"). The Company will apply the Modified Prospective Method of adoption in its
application of FASB 123(R). Under this method, compensation cost is recognized beginning with the Effective Date (a) based on application of the requirements of FASB 123(R) to all
share-based payments granted after the Effective Date and (b) based on application of the requirements of FASB 123 to all awards granted to employees prior to the Effective Date of
FASB 123(R) that remain unvested on the Effective Date.

As
permitted by FASB 123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using APB 25's intrinsic value method, and therefore generally recognize no
compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of FASB 123(R)'s fair value method will have a significant impact on the result of operations, although it will have no
impact on the overall financial position. In 2006 the Company expects to record approximately $34 million in compensation expense in connection with the adoption of
FASB 123(R). The impact of adoption of FASB 123(R) beyond fiscal 2006 cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on our stock price and the amount of share-based payments
granted in future periods, as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions, including, but not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise
behaviors. However, had the Company adopted FASB 123(R) in prior periods, the effect would have approximated the impact of FASB 123 as described in "Stock-Based Compensation", above, in
this Note B.

In
May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ("SFAS 154")." SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20,
"Accounting Changes" and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements." SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial
statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impractible to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. The

F-14

Company
does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 on January 1, 2006 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In
November 2005, FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and
Its Application to Certain Investments" ("FSP FAS 115-1"), which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered
impaired, whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, and on measuring such impairment loss. FSP FAS 115-1 also includes accounting considerations
subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as
other-than-temporary impairments. FSP FAS 115-1 is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company is required
to adopt FSP FAS 115-1 in the first quarter of 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
results of operations or financial condition.

C. Sale of Assets

In March and December 2003, in two independent transactions, the Company sold the assets of its Discovery Tools and Services business. The Discovery Tools
and Services business specialized in assay development, screening services, instrumentation development and sales and the manufacture and sale of proteins, reagents and probes. As a result of these
sales, the Company now operates in one operating segment, Pharmaceuticals.

On
March 28, 2003, Vertex completed the sale of certain assets of the Discovery Tools and Services business, including certain proprietary reagents, probes and proteins and
certain biochemical and cellular assay capabilities, to Invitrogen Corporation ("PanVera Asset Sale"). Substantially all of the assets sold were owned by Vertex's wholly-owned subsidiary, PanVera LLC
("PanVera"). In connection with the sale, Mirus Corporation ("Mirus") exercised a right of first refusal with respect to shares of Mirus owned by PanVera. Additionally, on the same date, Mirus
acquired certain of PanVera's assets. The aggregate gross consideration received by PanVera for the assets conveyed to Invitrogen and Mirus was approximately $97 million in cash and assumption
of certain liabilities.

In
connection with the sale, Vertex obtained a license from Invitrogen to make and use the reagents and probes sold to Invitrogen, solely for its drug discovery activities, conducted
independently and with collaborators, but has agreed that it will not engage in the business of providing reagents, probes or assay development services to third parties for a term of five years.
Vertex also agreed to purchase a minimum of $3 million of specified products annually from Invitrogen for three years after the completion of the sale. The prices of the products within the
purchase commitment approximate fair value. The sale did not include the instrumentation assets of the Discovery Tools and Services business, which were historically managed both financially and
operationally together with the assets sold on March 28, 2003.

F-15

The Company recorded a gain on the PanVera Asset Sale of approximately $69 million. The gain was recorded net of transaction costs and certain accruals and
receivables established for transaction bonuses payable by Vertex to former employees meeting certain employment requirements, an obligation in connection with certain annual contractual license fees
under a customer agreement, estimated losses on the three-year purchase commitment for required payments in excess of the fair value of products expected to be purchased and an adjustment based upon
the net book value of the assets sold on the closing date. Vertex has not recorded any income tax liability associated with the gain on the sale; operating losses were used to offset the taxable
income generated from the sale. Accruals recorded in connection with the sale are included in other obligations, current, on the consolidated balance sheets.

On
December 3, 2003, Vertex sold the remaining instrumentation assets of its Discovery Tools and Services business to Aurora Discovery, Inc., a new company formed by
Telegraph Hill Partners, LP and certain former employees of Vertex, for approximately $4.3 million and the assumption of certain liabilities. The assets sold were used to develop and
commercialize liquid and cell-dispensing instruments that are used in high-throughput drug discovery screening and large-scale, automated molecular biology. Vertex has retained
non-exclusive licenses to use the instrumentation technologies sold in its drug discovery research. The Company recorded a $1.0 million gain on the sale. The gain was recorded net
of transaction costs. The Company did not record any income tax liability associated with the sale in December 2003; operating losses were used to offset the taxable income generated from the
sale.

The
combination of the Discovery Tools and Services assets sold in March 2003 and in December 2003 represents a component of the Company's business that, beginning in 2002,
was managed separately both financially and operationally.

In
accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144"), the results of operations and cash flows of the assets
sold have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements under the heading "discontinued operations" for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The reclassification of the
amounts to discontinued operations has been prepared using certain estimates and assumptions deemed appropriate based upon information available. Amounts reclassified to discontinued operations are
not necessarily indicative of what revenues, expenses or income would have been had the business operated on a stand-alone basis.

Income
from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 is comprised of the following revenue and expenses (in thousands):

D. Restructuring and Other Expense

On June 10, 2003, Vertex adopted a plan to restructure its operations to coincide with its increasing internal emphasis on advancing drug candidates
through clinical development to

F-16

commercialization.
The restructuring was designed to re-balance the Company's relative investments in research and development to better support the Company's long-term
objective of becoming a profitable pharmaceutical company. The restructuring plan included a workforce reduction, write-offs of certain assets and a decision not to occupy approximately
290,000 square feet of specialized laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts under lease to Vertex (the "Kendall Square lease"). The Kendall Square lease commenced in January 2003
and has a 15-year term. Based on developments in the Company's clinical pipeline in the second quarter of 2005, the Company revised its assessment of its real estate requirements. The
Company now expects to occupy approximately 120,000 square feet of the facility subject to the Kendall Square lease (the "Kendall Square Facility") in the future. The Company currently has sublease
arrangements in place for the remaining rentable square footage of the Kendall Square Facility.

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded net restructuring expense of $8.1 million. This net expense includes a $10.0 million credit to
the restructuring accrual made when the Company decided to occupy and use a portion of the Kendall Square Facility, which was offset by (i) the estimated incremental net ongoing lease
obligations associated with the portion of the Kendall Square that the Company does not intend to occupy and (ii) imputed interest costs relating to the restructuring liability. The portion of
the $18.2 million additional charge in 2005 that was for incremental lease obligations was related to the revision of certain key estimates and assumptions about operating costs, including real
estate taxes associated with the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that the Company does not intend to occupy.

In accordance with SFAS 146, the Company's initial estimate of its liability for its net ongoing costs associated with the Kendall Square
Lease obligation was recorded in the second quarter of 2003 at fair value. The restructuring expense incurred from the second quarter of 2003 through the end of the first quarter of 2005 relates to
the estimated incremental net ongoing lease obligations associated with the entire Kendall Square Facility, together with imputed interest costs relating to the restructuring liability. The
restructuring expense incurred in the period beginning in the second quarter of 2005 will continue to be estimated in accordance with SFAS 146, but will relate only to the portion of the
building that the Company still does not intend to occupy. The lease obligations associated with the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that the Company expects to occupy and use for its
operations are recorded as rental expense in the period incurred. The Company reviews its assumptions and estimates quarterly and updates its estimates of this liability as changes in circumstances
require. As prescribed by SFAS 146, the expense and liability recorded is calculated using probability-weighted discounted cash-flows of the Company's estimated ongoing lease
obligations, including contractual rental and build-out commitments, net of estimated sublease rentals, offset by related sublease costs.

In
estimating the expense and liability under its Kendall Square lease obligation, the Company estimated the costs that would be incurred to satisfy its rental and build-out
commitments under the lease (including operating costs), the time necessary to sublease the space, the projected sublease rental rates and the anticipated durations of subleases. The Company validates
its estimates and assumptions through consultations with independent third parties having relevant expertise. The Company used a credit-adjusted risk-free rate of approximately 10% to
discount the estimated cash flows. The Company will review its estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis, until the termination of the Kendall Square lease, and will make whatever
modifications management believes necessary, based on the Company's best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances. The Company's estimates have changed in the past, and may change in the future,
resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of liability, and the effect of any such adjustments could be material. Because the Company's estimate of the liability includes the application of
a discount rate to reflect the time-value of money, the estimate of the liability will increase each quarter simply as a result of the passage of time. Changes to the Company's estimate of
the liability are recorded as additional restructuring expense/(credit).

The
severance, benefits and other related costs also were recorded in accordance with SFAS 146 in the second quarter of 2003. The Company specifically identified all employees
whose employment was to be terminated and notified them prior to the end of the quarter in which the related charge was recorded. This restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of 111 employees, or
13% of the Company's

F-18

workforce,
of which 66 were from the Cambridge site and 45 were from the San Diego site. Of the terminated employees, 59% were from research, 30% were from sales, general and administrative, who
primarily supported research, and 11% were from development.

The
restructuring accrual of $43.0 million at December 31, 2005 relates solely to the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that the Company does not intend to use for its
operations and includes build-out commitments and other lease obligations, recorded at net present value.

Of
the $43.0 million restructuring accrual at December 31, 2005, the Company classified $14.4 million as short-term and $28.6 million as long-term. The
short-term portion of the accrual represents the amount the Company expects to pay out in 2006.

The
Company has marketable securities of $283,112,000 and $331,240,000 classifed as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and $46,353,000 and $6,074,000, respectively, classified as long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

The
Company reviews investments in municipal bond securities, US government securities, and corporate debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment whenever
the fair value of an investment is less than amortized cost and evidence indicates that an investment's carrying amount is not recoverable within a reasonable period of time. To determine whether an
impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers whether the
evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes reasons for the impairment, compliance with the
Company's investment policy, the severity and the duration of the impairment and changes in value subsequent to year end. The following table summarizes the fair value and gross unrealized losses
related to marketable securities, aggregated by

The
Company owned 154 available-for-sale marketable securities at December 31, 2005. Of these 154 securities, there were 71 securities with losses for twelve months or more.

U.S. Government Securities

The unrealized losses on the investments in U.S. Treasury obligations and direct obligations of the U.S. Government agencies were caused by rising interest rates.
Because the Company has the ability to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be
other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Corporate debt securities

The unrealized losses on the investments in corporate bonds were caused by rising interest rates. The corporate bonds held by the Company are high investment
grade and there were no credit events on any of the corporate bonds held. Therefore, the Company does not believe that it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
contractual terms of the investments. It is expected that the corporate bonds will not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Because the Company has the ability to hold
these investments until a recovery of fair

F-21

value,
which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Gross
realized gains and losses for 2005 were $15,000 and $75,000, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses for 2004 were $628,000 and $205,000, respectively. Gross realized gains
for 2003 were $1,249,000. There were no gross realized losses for 2003. Maturities stated are effective maturities.

F. Restricted Cash

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company held $41,482,000 and $49,847,000, respectively, in restricted cash. At December 31, 2005 and 2004 the
balance was held in deposit with certain banks
predominantly to collateralize conditional stand-by letters of credit in the names of the Company's landlords pursuant to certain operating lease agreements.

In
2005 and 2004, the Company wrote off certain assets that were fully depreciated and no longer utilized. There was no effect on the Company's net property and equipment. Additionally,
the Company wrote off or sold certain assets that were not fully depreciated. The net loss on disposal of those assets was $344,000 for 2005 and $43,000 for 2004.

H. Investments

In accordance with the Company's policy, as outlined in Note B, "Accounting Policies," the Company assessed its investment in Altus
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Altus"), which it accounts for using the cost method, and determined that there had not been any adjustments to the fair values of that investment which would indicate a
decrease in its fair value below the carrying value that would require the Company to write down the investment basis of the asset, as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. The
Company's cost basis carrying value in its outstanding equity and warrants of Altus was $18,863,000 at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

F-22

Altus completed an initial public offering in January 2006. Vertex owns 817,749 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,962,494 shares of common
stock. In addition, the Company also holds 450,000 shares of redeemable preferred stock, which are not convertible into common stock and which are redeemable, at Vertex's option on or after
December 31, 2010, or by Altus at any time. The Company is restricted from trading Altus securities for a period of six months following the initial public offering. Due to the public offering,
in 2006 the Company will classify the common stock as an available-for-sale investment and record it at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses included as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of stockholders' equity, until such gains and losses are realized. The Company will continue to account for the
warrants under the cost method of accounting until the end of the restricted trading period, at which time the warrants will be classified as derivatives with gains or losses based on the fair market
value of the warrants included in the statement of operations. The Company will continue to account for the redeemable preferred stock under the cost method of accounting.

J. Commitments

The Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The Company's leases have terms through
April 2018. The term of the Kendall Square lease began January 1, 2003 and lease payments commenced in May 2003. The Company has an obligation, staged through 2006, to build-out
the space into finished laboratory and office space. The lease will expire in 2018 and the Company has the option to extend the term for two consecutive terms of ten years each, ultimately expiring in
2038. The Company expects to occupy and use for its operations approximately 120,000 square feet of the Kendall Square Facility. The Company has sublease arrangements in place for the remaining
rentable square footage of the Kendall Square Facility. See Note D, "Restructuring and Other Expense" for further information.

Rental
expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $20,427,000, which included $4,669,000 related to the space that the Company intends to occupy in the
Kendall Square Facility. For the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, rental expense primarily related to facilities, excluding the Kendall Square lease, was $16,303,000, and $15,449,000,
respectively.

The
Company has future contractual commitments in connection with its research and development programs. For 2006 and 2007 the amount committed under these contracts is $1,035,000 and
$75,000, respectively.

In
connection with the PanVera Asset Sale in 2003 (see Note C, "Sale of Assets"), Vertex agreed to purchase a minimum of $3 million of certain specified products from
Invitrogen annually for three years after the completion of the sale. The estimated losses on the three-year purchase commitment for anticipated payments in excess of the fair value of
products expected to be purchased
have been booked against the gain on the sale and recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets.

K. Convertible Subordinated Notes

On February 13, 2004, the Company issued approximately $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes
due in February 2011 (the "February 2011 Notes") in exchange for an equal principal amount of its outstanding 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due in September 2007 (the "2007
Notes"). On September 17, 2004, the Company issued approximately $79.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due in February 2011
(the "September 2011 Notes") in exchange for an equal principal amount of its 2007 Notes. The terms of the September 2011 Notes are identical to those of the February 2011 Notes
(the February 2011 Notes and the September 2011 Notes are referred to together as the "2011 Notes").

The
2011 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a price equal to $14.94 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2011 Notes
bear interest at the rate of 5.75% per annum, and the Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the 2011 Notes on February 15
and August 15 of each year. On or after February 15, 2007, the Company may redeem the 2011 Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any. The deferred issuance costs associated with

F-24

the
issuance of the 2011 Notes, which are classified as long-term other assets, were approximately $3.0 million for the February 2011 Notes and $1.9 million for the
September 2011 Notes.

The
2007 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a price equal to $92.26 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2007 Notes
bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum, and the Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the 2007 Notes on March 19 and
September 19 of each year. The 2007 Notes are redeemable by the Company at any time at specific redemption prices if the closing price of the Company's common stock exceeds 120% of the
conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days. The deferred issuance costs associated with the original sale of the 2007 Notes were $9.3 million.

As
a result of the 2004 exchanges of the 2007 Notes for 2011 Notes, the Company recorded a charge on the retirement of $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2007
Notes in February 2004 in the amount of $2.5 million, and a charge on the retirement of $79.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Notes in September 2004 in
the amount of $1.0 million. These charges represent that portion of the unamortized deferred issuance costs applicable to the amount of 2007 Notes retired. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, $1.0 million was amortized to interest expense for the issuance costs of the remaining 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
$1.3 million was amortized to interest expense for the issuance costs of the 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2003, $1.4 million was amortized to
interest expense for the issuance costs associated with the 2007 Notes.

In
September 2005, the Company issued approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock to certain holders of 2007 Notes in exchange for approximately $40.5 million in
aggregate principal amount of those notes, plus accrued interest. As a result of the exchange, the Company incurred a non-cash charge of $36.3 million. This charge is related to the
incremental shares issued in the transaction over the number that would have been issued upon conversion of the 2007 Notes under their original terms, at the original conversion price of $92.26. The
following items related to the exchange were recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets: accrued interest of approximately $1.0 million;
remaining unamortized issuance costs of the exchanged 2007 Notes of approximately $0.3 million; and $0.1 million of issuance costs of the common stock.

In
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company issued approximately 8.1 million shares of common stock to certain holders of 2011 Notes in exchange for approximately
$114.5 million in aggregate principal amount of those notes, plus accrued interest. As a result of the exchange, the Company incurred a non-cash charge of $11.9 million. This
charge is related to the incremental shares issued in the transaction over the number that would have been issued upon conversion of the 2011 Notes under their original terms, at the original
conversion price of $14.94. The following items related to the exchange were recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets: accrued interest of
approximately $2.0 million; remaining unamortized issuance costs of the exchanged 2011 Notes of approximately $1.8 million; and $0.2 million of issuance costs of the common stock.

At
December 31, 2005, there was approximately $42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Notes and approximately $118.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of the 2011 Notes outstanding. At December 31, 2005, the 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes had a fair value of $40.5 million and $227.0 million, respectively, as obtained from
a quoted market source.

F-25

L. Equity Offering

In June 2005, the Company completed a public offering of 13,512,500 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' over-allotment of
1,762,500 shares, at a price of $13.00 per share. This transaction resulted in net proceeds of approximately $165.4 million to the Company. The net proceeds include $10.3 million of
stock offering costs which were recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.

M. Income Taxes

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there is no provision for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations.

The
Company's federal statutory income tax rate for 2005, 2004, and 2003 was 34%. The Company has incurred losses from operations but has not recorded an income tax benefit for 2005,
2004, and 2003, as the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against its net operating losses and other net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to the realizability of these tax
assets.

The
difference between the Company's "expected" tax provision (benefit), as computed by applying the U.S federal corporate tax rate of 34% to (loss) before provision for income taxes,
and actual tax is reconciled as follows (in thousands):

For
federal income tax purposes, as of December 31, 2005, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,042,065,000, and $22,122,000 of tax credits, which
may be used to offset future federal income and tax liability, respectively. For state income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $576,315,000, and
8,819,000 of tax credits, which may be used to offset future state income and tax liability, respectively. These operating loss carryforwards began to expire in 2005, and the tax credit carryforwards
began to expire in 2004. After consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, management has established a valuation allowance for the full amount of the 2005 net deferred tax asset
since it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Deferred
tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are

expected
to reverse. The components of the deferred taxes at December 31 were as follows (in thousands):

Ownership
changes, as defined by Internal Revenue Code, may limit the amount of net operating losses and research and experimentation credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually
to offset future taxable income and taxes payable.

N. Common and Preferred Stock

Common Stock

Stock and Option Plans

The Company has a 1991 Stock Option Plan (the "1991 Plan"), a 1994 Stock and Option Plan (the "1994 Plan") and a 1996 Stock and Option Plan (the "1996 Plan")
(together, the "Plans"). Stock options may be granted under the Plans either as options intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" ("ISOs") under the Internal Revenue Code or as
non-qualified stock options ("NQSOs"). Under the 1991 Plan, stock options may be granted to employees (including officers and directors who are employees) and to consultants of the Company
(NQSOs only). Under the 1994 Plan and the 1996 Plan, stock rights, which may be (i) ISOs when Internal Revenue Code requirements are met, (ii) NQSOs, or (iii) shares of common
stock or the opportunity to make a direct purchase of shares of common stock ("Stock Awards"), may be granted to employees (including officers and directors who are employees) and consultants,
advisors and non-employee directors (NQSOs and stock awards only). Under the 1991 Plan and the 1994 Plan, ISOs may be granted at a price not less than the fair market value of the common

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants restricted shares to employees, at a price per share equal to the par value of the Company's common stock, or $0.01 per share. In general, the
restricted shares vest over four years in four equal annual installments.

During
2005, the Company issued approximately 616,000 restricted shares to employees. The shares had an average fair value on dates of grant of $13.77. At December 31, 2005, the
Company had approximately 1,521,000 restricted shares unvested and outstanding.

During
2004, the Company issued approximately 1,369,000 restricted shares to employees. The shares had an average fair value on dates of grant of $9.39. Included in the total number of
restricted shares
issued is a one-time grant of approximately 923,000 shares to senior managers and executives on May 6, 2004. Under the terms of the one-time grant to senior managers and
executives, the restricted shares vest in two increments: 50% on May 6, 2007 (the three year anniversary of the grant), and the balance on May 6, 2009 or earlier, upon the Company
achieving profitability, as measured under specified criteria applied by the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately 1,399,000 restricted shares unvested and
outstanding.

The
Company has recorded deferred compensation, net of cancellations, of approximately $6,172,000 and $12,206,000 related to the issuance of restricted shares during the twelve months
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company recorded compensation expense of approximately $4,421,000, $1,661,000, and $16,000 for the twelve months ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively, related to all restricted shares outstanding during those periods.

The
Company records and amortizes over the related vesting periods deferred compensation representing the difference between the exercise price of stock options granted or the price per
share of restricted stock issued, and the fair value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant or issuance. There was no deferred compensation expense related to stock options in 2005, 2004
and 2003.

F-29

For
the year ended December 31, 2005 the Company recorded $211,000 in compensation expense related to stock and option grants in accordance with executives' severance agreements.

Compensation
cost, calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, recognized in connection with the issuance of stock options to nonemployees was $161,826 in 2003. There was no
compensation cost recognized in 2005 and 2004 related to the issuance of stock options to nonemployees.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

On July 1, 1992, Vertex adopted the Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Vertex Purchase Plan"), which has been
subsequently amended to add additional shares to the pool of available shares under the plan, including an amendment in 2002 to add 600,000 shares and an amendment in 2004 to add
1,500,000 shares. The Vertex Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to enroll in a twelve-month offering period comprising two six-month purchase periods. Participants may purchase shares of
the Company's common stock, through payroll deductions, at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the applicable twelve-month offering period, or the
last day of the applicable six-month purchase period, whichever is lower.

During
2005, 2004, and 2003 the following shares were issued to employees under the Vertex Purchase Plan (shares in thousands):

Rights

Each Vertex shareholder also holds one share purchase right (a "Right") for each share of common stock owned. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the
Company one half of one-hundredth of a share of Series A junior participating preferred stock, $0.01 par value (the "Junior Preferred Shares"), of the Company at a price of $135 per
one half of one-hundredth of a Junior Preferred Share subject to adjustment (the "Purchase Price"). The Rights are not exercisable until after the acquisition by a person or group of 15%
or more of the outstanding common stock (an "Acquiring Person"), or after the announcement of an intention to make or commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer, the consummation of which would
result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock (the earlier of such dates being called the

F-30

"Distribution
Date"). Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the Rights will be traded with, and only with, the common stock. Until a Right is exercised, the
Right will not entitle the holder thereof to any rights as a stockholder.

If
any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person, will thereafter have the right to receive upon
exercise and payment of the Purchase Price that number of shares of common stock having a market value of two times the Purchase Price and, if the Company is acquired in a business combination
transaction or 50% or more of its assets are sold, each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise and payment of the Purchase Price that number of shares of common
stock of the acquiring company which at the time of the transaction will have a market value of two times the Purchase Price.

At
any time after any person becomes an acquiring person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding common stock, the Board of Directors of
the Company may cause the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group) to be exchanged, in whole or in part, for common stock or Junior Preferred Shares, at an exchange rate of one share
of common stock per Right or one half of one-hundredth of a Junior Preferred Share per Right.

At
any time prior to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the
Rights at a price of $0.01 per Right.

The
Rights have certain anti-takeover effects, in that they will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire a significant interest in Vertex on terms not
approved by the Board of Directors.

O. Significant Revenue Arrangements

The Company has formed strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and other organizations in the areas of drug discovery, development, and
commercialization. Research, development and commercialization agreements provide the Company with financial support and other valuable resources for its research programs and for the development of
clinical drug candidates, and the marketing and sales of products.

Collaborative Research, Development and Commercialization Agreements

In the Company's collaborative research, development and commercialization programs the Company seeks to discover, develop and commercialize pharmaceutical
products in conjunction with and supported by the Company's collaborators. Collaborative research and development arrangements may provide research funding over an initial contract period with renewal
and termination options that

F-31

vary
by agreement. The agreements may also include milestone payments based on the achievement of a pre-agreed objective or the occurrence of a designated event. The agreements may also
contain development reimbursement provisions, royalty rights or profit sharing rights and manufacturing options. The Company has entered into significant research and development collaborations under
terms which vary from agreement to agreement.

Novartis

In May 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG ("Novartis") to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization
of small molecule drugs directed at protein kinases. The agreement was amended in February 2004. Under the original agreement, the Company was responsible for drug discovery and clinical
proof-of-concept testing of all drug candidates. Novartis agreed to pay the Company up to $200 million in research funding through April 2006, and to loan the
Company up to $200 million on a non-interest-bearing basis to support clinical proof-of-concept studies. Development loans with respect to any drug
candidates accepted by Novartis for development would be forgiven. Under the amended agreement, Vertex will continue to receive research funding through April 2006 along with development
milestone payments and royalties with respect to any drug candidates selected by Novartis for development. Novartis holds an option to develop drug candidates meeting certain pre-agreed
criteria. The option is exercisable with respect to each development candidate at the pre-development stage, at which point a $10 million milestone payment will be due from
Novartis, with up to $25 million in additional pre-commercial milestone payments. Following completion of the six-year research term in April 2006, Novartis' development
option with respect to all compounds discovered in the research program will terminate no later than the end of a specified period following delivery by Vertex to Novartis of a final research report.
Vertex retains all rights to any candidate not selected by Novartis, as well as to all of the intellectual property it generates under the collaboration that is not specific to candidates selected by
Novartis for development. As part of the amended agreement, restrictions under the original agreement that limited Novartis' right to pursue kinase research and development outside the collaboration
were removed, and the development loan facility was terminated. In November 2004, Novartis accepted VX-322 for preclinical development and made a $10 million milestone
payment to Vertex that is being recognized as revenue over the term of the contract. Novartis will have exclusive worldwide development, manufacturing and commercialization rights to
VX-322 and any other drug candidates that it accepts from the Company for development. The Company will receive royalties on any products that are marketed as part of the collaboration. In
2005, 2004, and 2003, the
Company recognized approximately $53.1 million, $50.5 million and $44.5 million, respectively, in revenue under this agreement.

Under
the amended agreement, the Company retained the right either to develop VX-680 to proof-of-concept under the terms of the original agreement, or
to elect to remove VX-680, and the Aurora kinases it targets, from the collaboration. On June 22, 2004, the Company exercised its election to develop VX-680 outside the
Novartis collaboration and repaid approximately $12.5 million of unspent and uncommitted development loans previously advanced on account of VX-680. Loans advanced under the
original agreement for the early development of certain other compounds will be forgiven on a compound-by-compound basis if any of those compounds are selected by Novartis for
development. All loans not forgiven under the facility will be repayable, without interest, in May 2008. At December 31, 2005, there were approximately $20 million in remaining
loans outstanding under the loan facility.

F-32

GlaxoSmithKline

In December 1993, the Company and GlaxoSmithKline entered into a collaborative agreement to research, develop and commercialize HIV protease inhibitors,
including Agenerase (amprenavir), Lexiva/Telzir (fosamprenavir calcium) and brecanavir (VX-385). Under the collaborative agreement, GlaxoSmithKline agreed to pay the Company up to
$42 million, comprised of a $15 million up-front license payment made in 1993, $14 million of product research funding over five years and $13 million of
development and commercialization milestone payments for an initial drug candidate. Research funding under this agreement ended on December 31, 1998 and Vertex has received the entire
$42 million referenced above plus additional milestones for the second and third generation drug candidates Lexiva/Telzir and brecanavir. Vertex is also entitled to royalties on sales of its
HIV protease inhibitors by GlaxoSmithKline. The Company began earning a royalty from GlaxoSmithKline in 1999 on sales of Agenerase, in the fourth quarter of 2003 on sales of Lexiva, and in the third
quarter of 2004 on sales of Telzir. GlaxoSmithKline is also obligated to pay additional development and commercialization milestone payments for subsequent drug candidates, including brecanavir.

In
the fourth quarter of 2004, GlaxoSmithKline paid the Company a milestone payment of $1 million based on the initiation of Phase II clinical trials for brecanavir. In the third
quarter of 2004, GlaxoSmithKline paid the Company a milestone payment of $1.5 million in connection with the regulatory approval of Telzir in the European Union. In the fourth quarter of 2003,
GlaxoSmithKline paid the Company a milestone payment of $2.5 million upon FDA approval of Lexiva in the United States. In the fourth quarter of 2002, GlaxoSmithKline paid the Company a
milestone payment of $1.5 million in connection with the submission of a new drug application for marketing approval of Lexiva/Telzir in the United States and the European Union.

GlaxoSmithKline
is required to bear the costs of developing drug candidates in its territory under the collaboration. Under the original agreement, GlaxoSmithKline had exclusive rights
to develop and commercialize Vertex's HIV protease inhibitors in all parts of the world except the Far East. In 2003, the Company amended the agreement to add the Far East to GlaxoSmithKline's
territory for development and commercialization of Lexiva/Telzir. The Company has retained certain bulk drug manufacturing rights and certain product educational rights in territories licensed to
GlaxoSmithKline. GlaxoSmithKline has the right to terminate its arrangement with the Company without cause upon twelve months' notice. Termination of the agreement by GlaxoSmithKline will relieve it
of its obligation to make further commercialization and development milestone and royalty payments and will end any license granted to GlaxoSmithKline by Vertex under the agreement.

In
June 1996, the Company and GlaxoSmithKline obtained a worldwide, non-exclusive license under certain G.D. Searle & Co. ("Searle," now owned by
Pharmacia/Pfizer) patents in the area of HIV protease inhibition. The Company pays Searle a royalty based on sales of Agenerase and Lexiva/Telzir.

In
the fourth quarter of 2005, GlaxoSmithKline and the Company entered into a collaborative agreement to develop and commercialize VX-409, Vertex's novel, subtype selective
sodium channel modulator for the treatment of pain. Under the terms of the agreement, GlaxoSmithKline has the exclusive right and license to develop and commercialize VX-409 and certain
back-up compounds worldwide. Vertex received a $20 million up-front license payment and could receive up to $385 million in additional development and commercial
milestone payments based on the development of VX-409 and back-up compounds in major pharmaceutical markets across a range of indications. GlaxoSmithKline will also pay Vertex
royalties on annual sales.

Revenues
and royalties earned from GlaxoSmithKline under both agreements were $52.8 million, $19.8 million, and $11.5 million, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

F-33

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated (CFFT)

In May 2004, Vertex entered into an agreement with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ("CFFT") that provided funding through
December 31, 2005 for Vertex's late-stage cystic fibrosis drug discovery effort. Under this agreement, Vertex will retain the right to develop and commercialize any compounds
discovered in the course of the research collaboration. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, Vertex recognized $14.5 million and $6.8 million in revenue related
to this agreement. During the first quarter of 2004, under an earlier agreement, Vertex earned revenue of $1.9 million.

In
January 2006, Vertex and CFFT extended the duration of their research collaboration. Under the extended agreement, CFFT has agreed to provide an additional $22 million
to Vertex for continued research funding through early 2008 directed toward CFTR corrector compounds. CFFT has the right to terminate the agreement without cause, effective on June 30, 2006 and
June 30, 2007, upon 60 days' prior written notice.

Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation

In June 2004, Vertex entered into a collaboration agreement with Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation, which will provide financial and other support for the
development of VX-950, the Company's oral hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor. Under the terms of the agreement, Mitsubishi has the right to develop and commercialize VX-950
in Japan and certain other Far East countries, while Vertex has retained exclusive development and marketing rights to VX-950 in the rest of the world, including North America and Europe.
The agreement provides for up to $33 million in payments by Mitsubishi to Vertex through Phase II clinical development, including an up-front license fee, development stage
milestone payments and contributions to certain drug development costs for VX-950. Further cost sharing beyond Phase II clinical
development will be determined by Mitsubishi and Vertex based on the design of registration studies for VX-950. The agreement also provides Vertex with royalties on any sales of
VX-950 in the Mitsubishi territory. Mitsubishi may terminate the agreement at any time without cause upon 60 days' prior written notice. In the fourth quarter of 2004, Mitsubishi
paid the Company a milestone payment of $4 million for first dosing of VX-950 in a patient in the Phase Ib clinical trial in the United States. Vertex recognized $3.4 million
and $1.8 million of non-milestone revenue in 2005 and 2004, respectively, under the Mitsubishi agreement, primarily for reimbursement of Vertex's expenses incurred in
VX-950 development.

Merck & Co., Inc.

In June 2004, Vertex entered into a global collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc. to develop and commercialize VX-680, Vertex's
lead Aurora kinase inhibitor, and possibly additional follow-on compound(s), for the treatment of cancer. The Merck collaboration provides for an up-front license payment of
$20 million, which was made in June 2004, and for research funding of $14 million over two years, ending in June 2006. In addition, Vertex could receive as much as
$350 million in milestone payments, including up to $130 million for the successful development of VX-680 in the first oncology indication and additional milestone payments
for development of VX-680 and follow-on compounds in subsequent major oncology indications. Merck is responsible for worldwide clinical development and commercialization of
VX-680 and any other Aurora kinase inhibitors discovered during the research program and will pay Vertex royalties on product sales. Merck may terminate the agreement without cause at any
time upon 90 days' advance written notice, except that six months' advance written notice

F-34

is
required for termination during the second year of the research term (ending June 2006) or at any time when a product has marketing approval in a major market and the termination is not the result
of a safety issue. Vertex recognized $17.1 million and $8.4 million of revenue related to research support and the up-front license payment for this collaboration in 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

In
the fourth quarter of 2005, Vertex received a $7.5 million milestone payment from Merck upon the demonstration of activity by VX-680 on a clinically relevant biomarker during a
Phase I clinical trial. Vertex recognized revenue of $5.6 million in 2005 related to this milestone. The remainder will be recognized over the remaining contract term.

In
addition, in the fourth quarter of 2005, Merck selected a follow-on compound (VX-667) for development. Merck paid the Company a milestone payment of $12 million
upon the selection of the follow-on compound. Vertex recognized revenue of $1.7 million in 2005 related to this milestone. The remainder will be recognized over the remaining
contract term.

Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

The Company and Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ("Kissei") are parties to an agreement to collaborate on the identification of inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase
and the development of those compounds as novel, orally active drugs for the treatment of inflammatory and neurological diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, Kissei agreed to pay the Company up
to $22 million comprised of a $4 million up-front license payment, $11 million of product research funding over three years and $7 million of development and
commercialization milestone payments. Additionally, Kissei agreed to reimburse the Company for certain development costs, including a portion of costs for Phase II trials of VX-702.
Research funding ended under this program on June 30, 2000 and the Company has received the full amount of research funding specified under the agreement. Kissei has exclusive rights to develop
and commercialize VX-702 in Japan and certain Far East countries and co-exclusive rights in China, Taiwan and South Korea. The Company retains exclusive marketing rights outside the Far
East and co-exclusive rights in China, Taiwan and South Korea. In addition, the Company will have the right to supply bulk drug material to Kissei for sale in its territory and will
receive royalties or drug supply payments on future product sales, if any. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately $7.3 million, $3.5 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, was
recognized as revenue under the p38 MAP kinase research and development program. The $7.3 million of revenue recognized in 2005 includes a $2.5 million milestone paid upon Kissei's
completion of regulatory filings in preparation for Phase I clinical development of VX-702 in Japan.

Q. Related Party Transactions

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had an interest-free loan outstanding to an officer in the amount of $36,000 and $97,000,
respectively, which was initially advanced in April 2002. The loan balance is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

In
2001, the Company entered into a four year consulting agreement with a director of the Company for the provision of part-time consulting services over a period of four
years, at the rate of $80,000 per year commencing in January 2002 and terminating in January 2006.

R. Contingencies

The Company has certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues contingent liabilities when it is
probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.

On
December 17, 2003, a purported class action,

Marguerite Sacchetti v. James C. Blair et al.,

was filed in the Superior Court of
the State of California, County of San Diego, naming as defendants all of the
directors of Aurora who approved the merger of Aurora and Vertex, which closed in July 2001. The plaintiffs claim that Aurora's directors breached their fiduciary duty to Aurora by, among other
things, negligently conducting a due diligence examination of Vertex by failing to discover alleged problems with VX-745, a Vertex drug candidate that was the subject of a development
program which was terminated by Vertex in September 2001. Vertex has certain indemnity obligations to Aurora's directors under the terms of the merger agreement between Vertex and Aurora, which
could result in Vertex liability for attorney's fees and costs in connection with this action, as well as for any ultimate judgment that might be awarded. There is an outstanding directors' and
officers' liability policy which may cover a significant portion of any such liability. The defendants are vigorously defending this suit. The Company believes this suit will be settled without any
significant liability to Vertex or the former Aurora directors.

S. Guarantees

As permitted under Massachusetts law, Vertex's Articles of Organization and Bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify certain of its officers and directors
for certain claims asserted against them in connection with their service as an officer or director. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under
these indemnification provisions is unlimited. However, the Company has purchased certain directors' and officers' liability insurance policies that reduce its monetary exposure and enable it to
recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal.

F-36

Vertex
customarily agrees in the ordinary course of its business to indemnification provisions in agreements with clinical trials investigators and sites in its drug development
programs, in sponsored research agreements with academic and not-for-profit institutions, in various comparable agreements involving parties performing services for the Company
in the ordinary course of business, and in its real estate leases. The Company also customarily agrees to certain indemnification provisions in its drug discovery and development collaboration
agreements. With respect to the Company's clinical trials and sponsored research agreements, these indemnification provisions typically apply to any claim asserted against the investigator or the
investigator's institution relating to personal injury or property damage, violations of law or certain breaches of the Company's contractual obligations arising out of the research or clinical
testing of the Company's compounds or drug candidates. With respect to lease agreements, the indemnification provisions typically apply to claims asserted against the landlord relating to personal
injury or property damage caused by the Company, to violations of law by the Company or to certain breaches of the Company's contractual obligations. The indemnification provisions appearing in the
Company's collaboration agreements are similar, but in addition provide some limited indemnification for its collaborator in the event of third party claims alleging infringement of intellectual
property rights. In each of the cases above, the indemnification obligation generally survives the termination of the agreement for some extended period, although the obligation typically has the most
relevance during the contract term and for a short period of time thereafter. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these provisions is
generally unlimited. The Company has purchased insurance policies covering personal injury, property damage and general liability that reduce its
exposure for indemnification and would enable it in many cases to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company has never paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits or settle claims
related to these indemnification provisions. Accordingly, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal.

Effective
on March 28, 2003 the Company sold certain assets of PanVera LLC to Invitrogen Corporation for approximately $97 million. The agreement with Invitrogen requires
the Company to indemnify Invitrogen against any loss it may suffer by reason of Vertex's breach of certain representations and warranties, or failure to perform certain covenants, contained in the
agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants are of a type customary in agreements of this sort. The Company's aggregate obligations under the indemnity are, with a few exceptions which
the Company believes are not material, capped at one-half of the purchase price, and apply to claims under representations and warranties made within fifteen months after closing (which
period has ended) although there is no corresponding time limit for claims made based on breaches of covenants. Invitrogen has made no claims to date under this indemnity, and the Company believes
that the estimated fair value of the remaining indemnification obligation is minimal.

Effective
on December 3, 2003, the Company sold certain instrumentation assets to Aurora Discovery, Inc. for approximately $4.3 million. The agreement with Aurora
Discovery, Inc. requires the Company to indemnify Aurora Discovery, Inc. against any loss it may suffer by reason of the Company's breach of certain representations and warranties, or
failure to perform certain covenants, contained in the agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants are of a type customary in agreements of this sort. The Company's aggregate obligations
under the indemnity are capped at one-half of the purchase price, and apply to claims under representations and warranties made within fifteen months after closing (which period has ended)
although there is no corresponding time limit for claims made based on breaches of covenants. Aurora Discovery, Inc. has made no claims to date under

F-37

this
indemnity, and the Company believes that the estimated fair value of the remaining indemnification obligation is minimal.

On
February 10, 2004, Vertex entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with UBS Securities LLC in connection with the exchange of approximately $153.1 million of the
February 2011 Notes for approximately $153.1 million of 2007 Notes. On September 13, 2004, the Company entered into a second Dealer Manager Agreement with UBS Securities in
connection with the exchange of approximately $79.3 million of the September 2004 Notes for approximately $79.3 million of 2007 Notes. Each of the Dealer Manager Agreements
requires the Company to indemnify UBS Securities against any loss UBS Securities may suffer by reason of the Company's breach of representations and warranties relating to the exchanges of the
convertible notes, the Companies failure to perform certain covenants in those agreements, the inclusion of any untrue statement of material fact in the materials provided to potential investors in
the 2011 Notes, the omission of any material fact needed to make those materials not misleading, and any actions taken by the Company or its representatives in connection with the exchanges. The
representations, warranties and covenants in the Dealer Manager Agreements are of a type customary in agreements of this sort. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification
obligations is minimal.

On
June 7, 2005, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as the representative of the several underwriters named therein,
relating to the public offering and sale of shares of the Company's common stock. The Purchase Agreement requires the Company to indemnify the underwriters against any loss they may suffer by reason
of the Company's breach of representations and warranties relating to that public offering, the Company's failure to perform certain covenants in those agreements, the inclusion of any untrue
statement of material fact in the prospectus used in connection with that offering, the omission of any material fact needed to make those materials not misleading, and any actions taken by the
Company or its representatives in connection with the offering. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Purchase Agreement are of a type customary in agreements of this sort. The Company
believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal.
