We are headquartered in Pasadena, California, USA, and provide our services through more than 200 offices located around the globe, primarily in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Australia, Africa, and Asia.

How We Operate

The relationships we have with our clients drive our business.  As a broad-based technical professional services firm, we offer a range of services to help our clients maintain a competitive edge in their respective markets.  From feasibility studies to design, to engineering, to construction, to start-up and commissioning, and then to operations and maintenance, we customize our services to meet business and project goals.  Our global network of professionals works with a multi-office approach in an effort to provide clients with the best, most economical project or program solutions.

We strive to provide client value through continuous improvement in our performance.  We regularly monitor our clients' expectations, our quality system, and our operational performance.  Tools such as our Jacobs Value Enhancing Practices, Global Standard Operating Procedures, project reviews, the Jacobs System to Ensure Project Success ("JSTEPS") and Safe Plans of Action ("SPAs") provide added value to our clients' projects.  They also allow us to create performance improvement actions during the project execution.  Through continuous improvement upon our performance, our tools, and our processes, we believe we can offer our clients superior value when they do business with us.

JacobsValue+

SM

("Value Plus") is an internal tool we use to document and quantify the actual value or savings we provide to our clients and their projects.  Some of the benefits achieved through the Value Plus program include lower total installed cost, shorter schedule, and reduced life cycle cost.  Value Plus is implemented at project initiation: a project goal is created, and cost-saving ideas are entered into the Value Plus database.  When the Value Plus cycle is complete, the project team and client identify unique cost and/or schedule reductions for the project.

Our Business Model

Our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services are key components of our business strategy.  Our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical planning, design, and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute long-term engineering and construction contracts.  We recognize that technical expertise alone cannot grow our business; project management skills and the ability to manage multi-million dollar projects and programs for our clients are critical to our success.  Crucial functions, such as project controls and procurement, are embedded within each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects.

Our business is set up to foster cooperation among teams and across our operating units. We do not maintain “profit centers” within the Company, nor do the operating groups compete against each other for contracts.  Our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services are key components of our business strategy. The following three ideas support our business model:

Multi-Domestic Approach

We work in many countries with locally staffed offices that share a common set of values, tools, and a single vision, while maintaining one-on-one contact with individual clients. This multi-domestic approach enables us to provide customized service suited to the locale while still taking advantage of the Company’s global network.

Boundaryless Approach

Our diversity encompasses our people, geographic reach, expertise, and technical capabilities. On projects around the world, we enhance local expertise with the best talent and the best technology available anywhere throughout the Company. This seamless, boundaryless approach keeps us flexible and enhances our ability to develop the best possible solutions for our clients, regardless of office or project location.

Cost Management Approach

As the global economy expands and companies providing technical, professional, and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries, the Company that can provide its clients with cost-efficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage. With a relentless focus on managing costs, we provide savings to clients and deliver superior technical, professional, and construction services safely, efficiently, and within the cost and time parameters our clients require.

Jacobs’ corporate functions include Quality and Safety, Finance and Administration, Legal, Compliance, Communications, Global Sales and Marketing, Human Resources, and Information Technology departments that are integral to our success.

The Company's Culture

Our employees are our most important and valuable asset and, therefore, the prevention of job-related injuries is given top priority.  It is the policy of the Company to provide and maintain a safe and healthy working environment and to follow operating practices that safeguard all employees and result in a more efficient operation.

BeyondZero® , the name of our program that promotes our culture of caring, moves beyond efforts to have an incident and injury-free safety performance.  We implement a true culture of caring where concern for employees' health, safety, and welfare extends outside the office walls, beyond the project site fences and into their homes, cars, and all the places where they interact with family, friends, and fellow employees. It

actively involves employees in championing the safety and wellness of themselves and others

, encouraging every employee to have the courage to take action and positively influence the intentions and behaviors of those around them, with the belief that the safety and wellness of employees are integrally linked to sound business performance and efficiency in project execution.

Since Jacobs’ founding, the Company has been based on doing business honestly, ethically, and with the utmost integrity.  Our culture, and our Code of Conduct that is signed annually by all employees, prescribes that everyone at the Company must adhere to Jacobs’ Core Values and ethical code, and comply with the laws that govern the Company’s activities worldwide. Our employees and business partners are expected to follow the highest principles of business conduct, integrity, and ethics as they carry out their responsibilities, and are guided by the following principles in carrying out their responsibilities: loyalty, compliance with applicable laws, observance of ethical standards, avoidance of conflicts of interest, and communication.  We endeavor to deal fairly with our employees, customers, suppliers, and competitors, and to respect the policies and procedures of those outside the Company.

Our objective is to present a clear and consistent image of our Company to our clients, employees, shareholders, and business partners - regarding how we behave, how we communicate, how we look, and most importantly, how our promises to our clients are delivered - anywhere in the world.

We accomplish this foremost through our core values, which allow us to behave as one company and unify us worldwide.   By keeping our core values as a central focus of our Company, we are able to think the same way and arrive at similar conclusions, regardless of our physical location.   Our core values are:

•

People are our greatest asset;

•

We are relationship-based; and

•

Growth is an imperative.

The balance inherent in our core values is also evident in our approach to sustainability, which maintains an even balance between the people, the economics, and the environmental aspects of business. Jacobs is driven to continuously improve efficiencies and reduce energy and resources, practices that drive down costs and contribute to a lower impact on the environment. The Company adheres to the following seven sus

tainability principles:

•

Sustainable development is a corporate priority;

•

We seek broad, deep, differentiated capabilities and services;

•

Sustainable development is integrated into our business;

•

Training and education are important;

•

Our facilities and operations follow sustainable principles;

•

We contribute to the common effort for sustainability; and

•

We are open and transparent.

Applying the best, most efficient and effective sustainable solutions for clients worldwide, in all major industries in our clients operate, allows us to make a significant contribution to a safe and sustainable future. Each year we issue a

Sustainability Report

that describes many of our efforts and accomplishments regarding environmental sustainability.

With respect to human resources, our goal is to establish an inclusive, diverse workplace that energizes the people who fuel our Company's growth.  Although we are a large company with over 66,300 employees in over 25 countries, our

Page 5


employees are unified in their focus on superior value, safety, and ethical business practices; regardless of the country.  Employees frequently move around the system as they grow their careers and serve clients; so everyone at the Company is urged to operate with a boundaryless mindset; connecting across geographies, disciplines, and industries to collaborate on innovative solutions that provide maximum value to clients.

How We Grow

Jacobs has grown significantly since its founding in 1947; both through organic growth and through strategic acquisition, an important part of the Company’s growth strategy. We have successfully acquired and integrated numerous companies over the years that have enhanced our capabilities, geographic reach, and offerings.

In terms of organic growth, our relationship-based business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability.  We pursue the development of long-term relationships and alliances with our clients.  By working with our clients on their capital programs, we increase our understanding of their overall business needs, as well as the unique technical requirements of their specific projects.  This increased understanding enables us, we believe, to provide superior value to our clients.  Our approach provides us with opportunities to market the services our clients are expected to need in the pre-design phase, such as master planning, permitting, or project finance options; in the design phase; and in the construction, post-start-up and commissioning phases of a facility, including operations and maintenance services.

Our relationships with clients also present ongoing opportunities to expand into adjacent markets.  For example, clients operating in the mining and minerals market often have a need for our infrastructure and buildings capabilities.  The same is true for clients operating in other markets.

We market our services to clients in a wide range of public and institutional, process, and industrial markets.  We increase our opportunities through selective market diversity, and are able to price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients by integrating and bundling our services.  In complex economic times, we have the ability to evolve along with market cycles worldwide.  When opportunities decrease in a particular market or geography, other opportunities often increase.  Because of our selective market diversity, we believe we are well-positioned to address a wide range of opportunities across many markets and geographies, which helps us grow our business.

Closely linked to our relationship-based business model is our multi-domestic geographic strategy. Our core clients can depend on us for assistance with their engineering and construction needs when they move projects around the world.  We therefore follow our clients into new geographic regions, which helps us perform meaningful portions of their projects by utilizing local resources rather than exporting the work to other offices.

The Role of Acquisitions and Strategic Investments in the Development Our Business

When we review acquisition targets, we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base.  We favor acquisitions that allow us to (i) expand into a new client market; (ii) enhance the range of services we provide existing clients; and/or (iii) access new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand.  By expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities, we strive to position ourselves as a preferred, single-source provider of technical, professional, and construction services to our major clients.  The following is a brief description of some of our recent key acquisitions (in chronological order):

After we complete an acquisition, we generally move very quickly to integrate the newly-acquired operations.  We typically assign senior operations personnel to manage the overall integration process with assistance from our sales, accounting, legal, IT, human resources, and risk management departments.  Although integrating newly acquired businesses can be very challenging, the assimilation process is critical in order to assure (i) that our global businesses processes and systems are properly deployed throughout the newly-acquired entities and (ii) that we can begin to leverage-off the acquired talents, skills, and expertise to grow our business and help our clients execute their capital programs.  Newly-acquired businesses are generally not left as stand-alone entities within the Company’s internal reporting system.  The businesses we acquire are typically folded in to existing operational organizations within the Company.

Financial Information About Segments

Although we describe our business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in terms of the various services we provide, the markets in which our clients operate, and the geographic areas in which we operate, we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to those accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).  In making this determination, we considered the various economic characteristics of our operations, including: the nature of the services we provide, the nature of our internal processes for delivering and distributing those services, and the types of customers we have.  In addition to the discussion that follows, please refer to Note 14 —

Segment Information

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

There is a high degree of similarity among the workforces employed across the categories of services we provide.  For example, professionals in engineering and design services (i.e., services provided by persons who are degreed, and in certain circumstances licensed, such as engineers, architects, scientists, and economists) exist in all four service categories.  In addition, there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and operations and maintenance ("O&M") projects.  In providing construction and O&M services, we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel.  These may include welders, pipe fitters, electricians, crane operators, and other personnel who work on very large capital projects (in the case of projects classified within the construction services category) or on smaller capital projects (in the case of maintenance projects classified within the O&M services category).

All of our offices use a matrix organizational structure.  Our results, therefore, are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines (e.g., electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, cost engineering, etc.) supporting project management personnel (who maintain the relationship between our clients and us and are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely, on time, and on budget).  Additionally, all of our operating regions use common tools, policies, and procedures to manage and run their respective units.  These include project review meetings, project performance evaluations, and project execution plans.

Each of the Company's operating regions provides most of the services the Company offers generally, and each of our operating regions includes in its customer base many of the same or similar clients as our other regions.

The use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform.  Whether it is computer-aided design and drafting (“CADD”) applications used by our engineering and design staff, or modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff, or scheduling, estimating, and cost control applications used by home-office personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities, all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large.

Furthermore, the types of information and internal reports used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”), who is also the Company’s chief executive officer, and other members of management to monitor performance, evaluate results of operations, allocate resources, and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment.  Accordingly, based on these similarities, we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of the disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Page 9


Services Provided

As described above, the services we provide generally fall into the following four broad categories: Project Services; Process, Scientific, and Systems Consulting services; Construction services; and Operations and Maintenance ("O&M")services.

The following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the last five fiscal years (in thousands):

Project Services

We employ the engineering, architecture, interiors, design, planning, and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants, buildings, infrastructure projects, technology and manufacturing facilities, consumer products manufacturing facilities, power plants and stations, pulp and paper plants, and other facilities.

We are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services, including "safety in design".  Through safety in design we integrate best practices, hazard analysis, and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects, taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction, start-up, testing and commissioning, and operations phases of a project.

In the area of construction management, we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients.  We may act as program director, whereby we oversee, on the owner's behalf, the complete planning, design, and construction phases of the project.  Alternatively, our services may be limited to providing construction consulting.

Project Services also includes planning, scheduling, procurement, estimating, cost engineering, project accounting, quality and safety, and all other key support services needed for complete cradle-to-grave project delivery.

Process, Scientific, and Systems Consulting Services

We employ the professional and technical skills and expertise with respect to a broad range of consulting services, including: performing pricing studies, market analyses, and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project; performing gasoline reformulation modeling; analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants; analyzing automation and control systems; analyzing, designing, and executing biocontainment strategies; developing and performing process protocols with respect to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated qualification and validation requirements; and performing geological and metallurgical studies.

Also included in this service category are revenues relating to defense and aerospace-related programs.  Such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide, and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems; weapons modeling and simulations; computer systems development, maintenance, and support; evaluation and testing of mission-critical control systems; aerospace, testing, and propulsion systems and facilities; and other highly technical or scientific tasks.

Construction Services

In addition to the construction management services included under Project Services above, we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients.  We also provide our clients with a modular construction option.  Our modular construction includes the engineering and construction of a facility in an off-site fabrication and assembly environment, with final completion during the field erection phase.  The option provides our clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction, which can compress and shorten the construction schedule, reduce risk, lower costs, and provide environmental benefits.  In the area of environmental remediation and restoration, we also provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients.

Page 10


Historically, our field construction activities have been focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work.  By focusing our construction efforts in this way, we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex projects based on designs prepared by third parties.  The financial risk to us of constructing complex assets based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixed-price contracts; therefore, we generally avoid this type of project.  However, we will pursue construction-only projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which we believe can result in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume.

Operations and Maintenance ("O&M") Services

O&M refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large, complex facilities on behalf of clients.  We provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility, including managing subcontractors and other on-site personnel.  O&M also includes process plant maintenance services, which generally involves all tasks required to keep a process plant (typically a refinery or chemical plant) in day-to-day operation.

Within the aerospace and defense areas, O&M often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain such sites as engine test facilities, weapons integration facilities, and high-tech simulation and verification centers.  Such O&M contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services; utilities operations and maintenance services; property management and disposition services; and construction support services.

Within the environmental area, O&M often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites.

Although the gross profit margins we realize from O&M services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide, the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower.  Also, O&M services offer us an opportunity for long-term relationships with clients.  This aspect of O&M services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services.

Page 11


The Industries and Markets in Which Our Clients Operate

We market our services to clients where the scope of work required by their capital projects and programs is within our expertise.  Within each market, we may offer specialty services unique to the sector, or services which differentiate us from our competitors in the marketplace.

The following table sets forth our revenues from each of the various industry groups and markets in which our clients operate for each of the last five fiscal years (in thousands):

Chemicals and Polymers

Our clients in this sector rely on our extensive knowledge of and experience with feedstock synthesis, chemical synthesis, and polymerization, including advanced polymerization reactors and state-of-the-art, post-reactor processing techniques to help bring new products and new facilities to market quickly and economically.  We apply best practices on capital and maintenance work by leveraging resources within our alliances and partnerships.  Specialty services we provide to our clients in these industries include project finance structuring consulting, market analysis, facility appraisal, and procurement with global inspection capabilities.

An important capability we offer our clients in the chemicals business is in the area of field services.  We have contracts with major chemical producers worldwide to provide construction, on-site maintenance, and turnaround activities.  Many of these contracts are evergreen in nature, with relationships extending over many years due to our focus on safety, value, and client satisfaction and lead us to numerous formal alliances.

Refining - Downstream

Our typical refining projects for global clients include new design and construction, revamps or expansions of existing plants, turnarounds, upgrades of individual process units within refineries, and long-term maintenance services.  We also provide process assessments, facility appraisals, feasibility studies, technology evaluations, project finance structuring and support, and multi-client subscription services.

Our modular construction capabilities, asset management/maintenance services, and formal client alliances help differentiate us to customers operating in this industry.  Using modular construction decreases congestion at the construction site and provides enhanced safety, cost, and project execution benefits in remote locations.

We also include power generation projects within our clients' refining and processing facilities, such as simple and combined cycle power projects, industrial gas turbines, and emergency power generation stations.  In addition, we offer support in the procurement and commissioning of equipment.

National Government Programs

We categorize our National Government Programs as generally relating to aerospace and defense programs or environmental programs for government entities.

Page 12


Aerospace and Defense Programs

We provide an in-depth range of science, engineering, construction and technical support services to the aerospace and defense industry.  Long-term clients include the Ministry of Defence in the U.K., NASA, the DoD, the U.S. Special Operations Command ("USSOCOM"), and the Australian Department of Defence.  Specific to NASA is our ability to design, build, operate, and maintain highly complex facilities relating to space systems, including test and evaluation facilities, launch facilities, and support infrastructure.

Our experience in the defense sector includes military systems acquisition management and strategic planning; operations and maintenance of test facilities and ranges; test and evaluation services in computer, laboratory, facility, and range environments; test facility computer systems instrumentation and diagnostics; and test facility design and build.  We also provide systems engineering and integration of complex weapons and space systems, as well as hardware and software design of complex flight and ground systems.

We have provided advanced technology engineering services to the DoD for more than 50 years, and currently support major defense programs in the U.S. and internationally.  We operate and maintain several DoD test centers and provide services and assist in the acquisition and development of systems and equipment for Special Operations Forces, as well as the development of biological, chemical, and nuclear detection and protection systems.

We maintain enterprise information systems for government and commercial clients worldwide, ranging from the operation of complex computational networks to the development and validation of specific software applications.  We also support the DoD in a number of information technology programs, including network design, integration, and support; command and control technology; development and maintenance of databases and customized applications; and security solutions.

Environmental Programs

We provide environmental investigation, permitting, restoration, remediation, engineering, and site operations services to a number of European, North American, and Middle Eastern government agencies.  Our projects include hazardous and nuclear waste management and site cleanup and closure; the preparation of feasibility studies and environmental investigations; environmental design; and remediation services on several national programs, as well as compliance with various national environmental policies.

Additionally, we support our clients in such areas as pollution prevention assessments; underground storage tank removal; contaminated soil and water remediation, monitoring and systems cleanup; long-term water quality management plans; and air quality planning and permitting.  Much of this type of work is in support of large infrastructure projects that are underway in both Europe and in North America.

As a differentiating aspect of our support to our government clients, we provide asset management services in the form of long-term infrastructure operations and maintenance.  Asset management also includes building closures that involve deactivation, decommissioning, and demolition of government facilities.  This is an integral part of our services for the DoE.

Infrastructure

The strengths we offer our clients in this industry group include expertise in transportation, transit, aviation, water and wastewater, and civil construction projects throughout North America, Europe, India, the Middle East, and Asia.  Representative clients include national government departments and agencies in the U.S. and the U.K.; state departments of transportation within the U.S.; other regional and local agencies; and private industry freight transport firms.

Transportation development/rehabilitation is a core competency of our infrastructure business.  Typical projects include highways, bridges, transit, tunnels, airports, railroads, intermodal facilities, and maritime or port projects where our interdisciplinary teams work independently or as an extension of the client's staff.  Providing alternative financing methods has proven successful in Europe where there is privatization of public infrastructure systems.

In water infrastructure, we help public and private sector clients develop or rehabilitate critical water resource systems.  Emerging economies are investing heavily in water and wastewater systems, while governments in North America and Europe are addressing the challenges of drought and aging infrastructure.  We also develop water/wastewater conveyance systems and water flood defense projects.

Oil & Gas - Upstream

Page 13


As international oil companies develop reserves and try to maximize their existing resources, our expertise in a range of production methods, combined with our commitment to safety and strength in project management, helps us deliver a wide range of projects for oil and gas operators.

In the exploration and production market, our projects range from oil recovery through steam injection to gas treating, gas gathering, and gas storage projects including extraction of commercially valuable elements of the gas stream, utilizing new technologies such as Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage ("SAGD").

Typical projects for our clients in this sector involve the design and construction of projects that recover oil and gas, and include oil thermal recovery facilities either by in-situ means or oil sands mining, upgraders, pipelines, gas plants, and CO


flood.  These are typically large projects that may involve many of our offices and often include work-share with our Mumbai, India office as a value-added engineering center to reduce project costs.

We also provide substantial maintenance and modification services for aging oil and gas facilities around the world.  In connection with the refining market, we also provide process assessments, facility appraisals, feasibility studies, technology evaluations, project finance structuring consulting services, and other support services.

Buildings

We have planned, designed, and constructed buildings for a variety of clients and markets for more than 60 years.  We believe our global presence and understanding of contracting and delivery demands keep us in an excellent position to provide professional services worldwide.

Our diversified client base encompasses both public and private sectors and relates primarily to institutional, commercial, government and corporate buildings, including projects at many of the world's leading medical and research centers, and universities.  We focus our efforts and resources in areas where capital spending initiatives drive demand, and where changes and advances in technology require innovative, value-adding solutions.  We also provide integrated facility management services (sometimes through joint ventures with third parties) for which we assume responsibility for the ongoing operation and maintenance of entire commercial or industrial complexes on behalf of clients.

We have specific capabilities in energy and power, master planning, and commissioning for office headquarters, aviation facilities, mission-critical facilities, municipal and civic buildings, courts and correctional facilities, mixed-use and commercial centers, healthcare and education campuses, and recreation complexes.

Advanced technology clients require highly specialized buildings in the fields of medical research, nano science, biotechnology, and laser sciences.  We offer total integrated design and construction management solutions to these projects, many of which are world leaders in their functions.

Our acquisition of design firm KlingStubbins reinforces our commitment to our clients in this industry group, expanding our capabilities to clients in the pharma-bio, data center, government intelligence, corporate headquarters/interiors, and science and technology-based education markets around the globe.

Our government building projects include large, multi-year programs in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. government agencies we serve include the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA"); the General Services Administration ("GSA"); the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"); the U.S. Departments of State, Treasury, Agriculture, Homeland Security, and Defense; and the Army National Guard, among others.  In the U.K., we are leading the Custodial Services' project management delivery program to upgrade the U.K. prison stock and also certain security-led programs such as upgrading works to the Palace of Westminster and some regional police authorities.

We are providing services to the DoD on military family housing; quality of life projects; training, maintenance, and readiness facilities; and command and control centers, as well as military facilities supporting the DoD's global re-basing program, the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure ("BRAC") program.

Mining and Minerals

Our mining and minerals business targets the non-ferrous and ferrous metal markets, precious metals, energy minerals (uranium, coal, oil sands), and industrial and fertilizer minerals (mineral sands, borates, trona, phosphates and potash).  We work with many of the resources companies undertaking new and existing facility upgrades and process plant developments.  We offer project management; front-end studies; and full EPCM capabilities; completions, commissioning and start-up services specializing in new plant construction, brownfield expansions, and sustaining capital and maintenance projects.

Page 14


For our mining and mineral clients, we provide the industry proprietary sulfuric acid production technology through our Chemetics® product - an important synergistic by-product of the smelting process and a key consumable in mines employing ore leaching technology.  We are also able to deliver value to our mining clients by providing distinctive adjacent capabilities such as infrastructure and major equipment and materials to support their mining operations.

By focusing on mitigating our clients' resource risk, we are able to address challenges of tight labor markets by providing a reliable and familiar labor pool for their ongoing projects.  We host local offices in the most active mining geographies (South America, Australia, Canada, India, and South Africa), and can thereby effectively help our clients improve their project delivery and resource availability.

Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology

We provide our pharmaceuticals and biotechnology clients single-point consulting, engineering, procurement, construction management, and validation ("EPCMV") project delivery, enabling us to execute the industry's largest capital programs on a single-responsibility basis.  Typical projects in this sector include laboratories, research and development facilities, pilot plants, bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient production facilities, full-scale biotechnology production facilities, and secondary manufacturing facilities.

As companies in this industry continue to experience pressure to decrease product time-to-market, reduce costs, and increase return on investment, the types of services we provide have grown over the years to include modular construction, as well as consulting and strategic planning to help our clients complete capital projects faster and more efficiently.

Regulatory compliance, state-of-the-art technology, and increased efficiencies are critical issues to our clients in these industries.  We have expertise in containment, barrier technology, locally controlled environments, building systems automation, and off-the-site design and fabrication of facility modules; in addition to vaccine production and purification, and aseptic processing.

Industrial and Other

We provide a broad range of services to our clients operating in the power; pulp and paper; high-technology manufacturing; and food, beverage, and consumer products industries and markets.

Power

Global energy demand is expected to grow by nearly 50 percent over the next 25 years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Significant capital spend in the power business is being driven by plant obsolescence and the need for utilities to comply with regulatory requirements and changes in environmental legislation.  Our typical projects include simple and combined cycle power projects, cogeneration power plants, asset lifetime extension projects, and emergency power generation stations.  In addition to traditional engineering, we offer services in procurement and commissioning of equipment, as well as construction services for the power market including thermal, biomass, renewables, and nuclear energy facilities.

Pulp and Paper

The pulp and paper industry has been consolidating for many years, and several of our traditional pulp and paper clients have emerged as major consumer product companies.  These clients have created new opportunities for us in non-traditional areas, such as wall board plants and facilities that manufacture diapers and feminine care products.  Typical projects range from small mill projects to complex, multi-million-dollar paper machine rebuilds, mill expansions, and the construction of new facilities.

Pulp and paper projects encompass many areas of a mill, and our expertise also includes the converting and packaging of paper products for distribution and consumer use.  Our pulp and paper capability extends through our offices in the U.S., U.K., France, Spain, Italy, and Mexico to clients worldwide.  A significant portion of our work consists of assisting our clients in their compliance with environmental regulations and standards that affect the pulp and paper industry.  We monitor all key environmental regulations affecting our clients and offer compliance studies, permitting support, design of pollution control systems, and compliance services regarding air pollutant standards and hazardous air pollutant emission limits from industrial boilers.

High-Technology Manufacturing

We provide our core services for a variety of high tech manufacturing and test facilities, particularly for clients in the automotive and industrial industries.  Typical automotive projects range from conceptual design and feasibility studies to

Page 15


complete design-build programs of aero-acoustic wind tunnels, engine test facilities, acoustic enclosures, transmission test stands; powertrain, environmental, emissions, altitude, and electromagnetic compatibility test facilities; in-line and end-of-line component test stands; and computer-based measurement and control systems.  We also serve advanced technology and research facilities, including facilities supporting research in fusion and fission energy, nanoscale materials, and high-powered lasers and X-rays to support important research activities in the U.S., Europe, and the U.K.

In addition, we perform projects for clients operating in the semiconductor industry.  Projects in the semiconductor industry are typically more complex than many other commercial facilities, requiring a greater emphasis on cleanroom and similar high-end technologies.  Our projects range from on-site plant engineering and tool hookups to multi-million dollar state-of-the-art wafer fabrication and crystal growing facilities used to produce solar energy cells, microprocessors for computers, and other consumer electronic devices.

Food, Beverage, and Consumer Products

As a provider to the food, beverage, and consumer products supply chain, our global presence and capabilities allow us to help our clients with targeted expansion and new investments.  Our food processing services include hygienic design, clean-in-place ("CIP") systems, heat transfer systems, material handling of liquids and solids, refrigeration, and compliance with government requirements.  From facility design to raw materials processing to converting, packaging, and distribution, our vast depth of expertise helps our clients do just that.  Our knowledge of food and beverage processing results in plants that are productive, efficient, and economical.

Backlog

Backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us.  With respect to O&M contracts, however, we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract.  For national government programs (other than U.S. federal O&M contracts), our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, excluding option periods.  In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client.  In addition, the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts.  Accordingly, backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings.

Our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates.  For additional information regarding our backlog including those risk factors specific to backlog, please refer to Item 1A —

Significant Customers

The following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the U.S. federal government for each of the last five fiscal years:

It is uncommon for a commercial customer to contribute 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues.  On occasion, however, we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which, primarily because of the amount of pass-through costs (discussed below) that is included in revenue, will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed 10% of total consolidated revenues.

Contracts

While there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake, our contracts generally fall into two broad categories: cost-reimbursable and fixed-price.  The following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years:

In accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts (including those with the U.S. federal government) are subject to termination at the discretion of the client, which is discussed in greater detail in Item 1A —

Risk Factors.

In such situations, our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination.

When we are directly responsible for engineering, design, procurement, and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility, we reflect the costs of materials, equipment, and subcontracts in both revenues and costs.  On other projects, where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items, these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs.  The following table sets forth the approximate amount of such pass-through costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years (in millions of dollars):

Cost-Reimbursable Contracts

Cost-reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit.  The profit element may be in the form of a simple mark-up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee, or a combination of a mark-up and a fee.  The fee element can also take several forms.  The fee may be a fixed amount; it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred; or it may be an incentive fee based on targets, milestones, or performance factors defined in the contract.  In general, we prefer cost-reimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price.

Fixed-Price Contracts

Fixed-price contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixed-price” contracts.  Under lump sum bid contracts, we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes.  This type of pricing presents certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies, and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period.  Additionally, it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients, which is contrary to our relationship-based business model.  Accordingly, lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract.  In contrast, under a negotiated fixed-price contract, we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client.  Negotiated fixed-price contracts frequently exist in single-responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project.  Thus, although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client, the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us.  However, because of economies that may be realized during the contract term, both negotiated fixed-price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts.  Over the past five years, most of our fixed-price work has been either negotiated fixed-price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services, rather than turn-key construction.

Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS

We operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future.  We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial.  If any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces.  If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities.

Construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials.  On many sites we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures.  If we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured.  Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities.  We are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety.  Although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental (“HSE”) work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability.

Our safety record is critical to our reputation.  Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures.  As a result, our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty engineering services.

Our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards could result in large damages. Our engineering practice, for example, involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects. While we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability, warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. These liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, or could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. In addition, clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. An uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a substantial impact on our operations.

The outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are a party to litigation in the normal course of business.  Since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation if there is a failure at any such project.  Such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects.  We can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met.  In many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses, and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts.  In addition, while

Page 19


clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us.

We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations.  Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make.  In addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under these programs.  As a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured.

Although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. We also monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. Our insurance is purchased from a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. If any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted.

In addition, the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors, and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects.  Similarly, we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients, subcontractors, and vendors.  If we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project.  A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results.  Additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant.

Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur.  Pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed-price contracts.  We may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates.

For fiscal


, approximately

17.0%

of our revenues were earned under contracts that were fixed-price in nature.  For these contracts, we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns.  Fixed-price contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies.  If these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of raw materials, or our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability to perform, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project.  If the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns or time of political uncertainty.

We provide technical, professional, construction, and O&M services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; programs for various national governments, including the U.S. federal government; chemicals and polymers; mining and minerals; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; power; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; and food and consumer products).  These markets and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty.

Page 20


Current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects.  They have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms, and otherwise slow their spending on our services.  For example, in the public sector, declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending.  In addition, due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable.  These conditions have reduced the demand for our services, which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.

Current economic and political conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services.  We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients’ markets.  In addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large.  A continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost.  Because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions.  As a result, our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate.

Fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards.

Commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways.  For example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments.  To the extent commodity prices decline and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects.  Rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects.  Cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel.

The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel, and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise.  From time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients.  In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel.

In addition, as some of our key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans.  If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability.  For example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts.  If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.

Page 21


Contracts with the U.S. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance.

Contracts with the U.S. federal government and other governments and their agencies, which are a significant source of our revenue and profit, are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as cost controls.  Government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration.  Contracts with the U.S. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of Congressional funding.  Governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated.

As a result, our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice.  Since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (for example, those with the U.S. federal government represented approximately

17.8%

of our total revenue in fiscal


), a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process.  The U.S. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contacts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract.  This process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs.  Moreover, we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities.  Our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.

In addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affects how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations.  For example, for contracts with the U.S. federal government, we must comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards, the Service Contract Act, and numerous regulations governing, environmental protection, and employment practices.  Government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts.  This includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations.

We also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings.  For example, government agencies such as the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations.  These audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies.

If we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties.  In addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed.  For example, in so-called "qui tam" actions brought by individuals or the government under the U.S. Federal False Claims Act or under similar state and local laws, treble damages can be awarded.  The occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain.  If our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts.  To the extent this occurs, our operations and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

The contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings.  Additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins.

As of the end of fiscal


, our backlog totaled approximately

$18.4 billion

.  There is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits.  In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client.

Page 22


In addition, the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts.  The revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates.  Projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project.  The risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of wide-spread economic slowdowns.

Additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability.  In some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements.  Typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction, and other performance criteria.  If we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past.

Negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems.

Although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions.  In addition, some of our clients depend on the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects.  Instability in the credit markets in the U.S. or abroad, could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain.  This situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us.  We may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit, which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business.  In addition, market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us.  We also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets.  If those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients.  These circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices.  In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a diminution in our clients’ access to the credit markets.  If one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

Furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in North America, Europe, South America, Australia and Asia.  Some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance.  Although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that this may occur in the future.  If this were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations.

Our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control.

As is common in the industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements.  This situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients.  Our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships.  If these circumstances occur, we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages, provide additional services, or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services.  Under agreements with joint and several liabilities, we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners.  These

Page 23


circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner.  In these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture.  These joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow.  To the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts.

Much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors we hire.  We also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects.  If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired.  If we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump-sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts.  If a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability.  In the current economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations.  The inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  In addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts.

In line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers.  These bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract.  If a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond, we cannot pursue that project.

Historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the Company's credit worthiness.  Because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost.  There can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms.  Our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Past and future environmental, heath, and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities.

We are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety.  These laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost.  Violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities.

Various U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities.  These laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants.  The liability under these laws is joint and several.  We have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current

Page 24


and prior ownership of various properties.  The discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

When we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions.  We may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers, and third parties as a result of such exposures. In addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws.  A claim, if not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

Such laws, regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways.  Such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue.  Our failure to comply with such laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state, and local government permits and approvals.  Any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances.  Failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.

If we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected.

We are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business.  For example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders.  Although we have policies and procedures to comply with U.S. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the Company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and therefore, our ability to do business.

Employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits.

Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation.  Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations.  For example, we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited.  The precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses.  Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance, and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws.  We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.  Despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents.  If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Page 25


The loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us.

A few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years.  For example, in fiscal


,


, and fiscal


, approximately

17.8%

,

19.9%

, and

22.1%

, respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the U.S. federal government.  Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay, or cancel their contracts at any time.  Our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We engage in a highly competitive business.  If we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

We face intense competition to provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients.  The extent of such competition varies by industry, geographic market, and project type.  For example, with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects.  Conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural, and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors.  If we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our larger competitors for engineering, construction, and maintenance services for process plants include Bechtel, Fluor, Foster Wheeler, KBR, Technip, WorleyParsons, CB&I, and AMEC.  In the area of buildings, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as HDR, HOK, AECOM, and Turner.  In the area of infrastructure, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as Parsons Brinckerhoff, HNTB, Tetra Tech, Parsons, and W.S. Atkins.  In the area of national government programs, our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as Leidos, CH2M Hill, Weston, Lockheed Martin, and Computer Sciences Corporation.

In addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in Risk Factors, our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies.

For fiscal


, approximately

44.2%

of our revenues was earned from clients outside the U.S.  Our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues.  Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:

•

Recessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as Europe, or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries;

•

Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges;

•

Unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements;

•

Lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights;

•

Renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts;

•

The adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions;

•

Embargoes;

•

Acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism;

•

The ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations;

•

Social, political, and economic instability;

•

Expropriation of property;

•

Tax increases;

•

Limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and

•

U.S. government policies.

The lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights.  In addition, military action or continued unrest, particularly in the Middle East, could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere.  To the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or

Page 26


adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.

We work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost.

Some of our services are performed in high risk locations, where the country or location is subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. Despite these activities, in these locations, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors.

Foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects.

Our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar.  While we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs.  We attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative (hedging) instruments, when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts.  These actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure.  Based on fluctuations in currency, the U.S. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly.  We may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries.

Our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth.  Acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties.

Our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies.  Acquiring companies presents a number of risks, including:

•

Assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated;

•

Valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the acquired business;

•

Failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;

•

Difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business;

•

The effects of diverting management’s attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies;

•

Potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations;

•

Potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition;

•

Difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities;

•

Increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities; and

•

Difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business.

While we often obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds, and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity.

In addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us.  Existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, may be insufficient to make acquisitions  Credit market conditions may also make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions. Acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced.

Page 27


In the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership.

One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities.  Accordingly, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 on December 7, 2007.  If we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the Company.

Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock.

Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock, because of a number of factors, including:

•

Fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers;

•

The number and significance of projects executed during a quarter;

•

Unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits;

•

The timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments;

•

Delays incurred in connection with a project;

•

Changes in prices of commodities or other supplies;

•

Weather conditions that delay work at project sites;

•

The timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives;

•

Natural disasters or other crises;

•

Staff levels and utilization rates;

•

Changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and

•

General economic and political conditions.

Our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements.

In preparing our financial statements, our management is required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:

•

Recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting;

•

Estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs;

•

Recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims;

•

Collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts;

•

The amount of reserves necessary for self-insured risks;

•

Accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves;

•

Valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions;

•

Valuation of stock-based compensation; and

•

The determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs.

Our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

An impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to test goodwill carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach.  As of

September 26, 2014

, we had

$3.0 billion

of goodwill, representing

35.8%

of our total assets of

$8.5 billion

.  We have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at

Page 28


the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year.  We also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value.  These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities, and other factors.

If the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge.  The amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken.  For a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see Item 7—

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

below.

We may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post-retirement benefit plans we manage.

We have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets.  For example, as of

September 26, 2014

, and

September 27, 2013

, our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans were projected to be underfunded by

$400.8 million

and

$402.5 million

, respectively.  See Note 6—

Pension Plans

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional disclosure.  In the future, our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan asset performance and other factors.  If we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts.

Rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services.  In addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price.  Because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately

83.0%

during fiscal


), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor.  However, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future.  Therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change.

Growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations.  For example, there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients.  Legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels.  Such changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  However, these changes could also increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects, that could have a positive impact on our business.  We cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers.

Our effective tax rate may increase or decrease.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  We are regularly under audit by tax authorities.  Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions.  An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Page 29


Systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate.

We rely heavily on computer, information, and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business.  From time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays.  In the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption, or release of data.  In addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, or similar events or disruptions.  Any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of intellectual property, and results of operations, as well as those of our clients.

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients.

Our technology and intellectual property provide us, in many instances, with a competitive advantage.  Although we protect our property through patent registrations, license restrictions, and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the U.S.  If we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced.  In addition, our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property.  There is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.

Extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, could negatively impact our ability to operate. As an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weather-related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed-price contract; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather-related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity. We may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man-made event, unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations. If we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man-made catastrophe, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a negative impact on our operations. In addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits.

We are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages.

We issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services.  For example, we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings.  If a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible, we could be subject to significant monetary damages.

Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.

We are a Delaware corporation.  Certain anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us.  In addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover.  For example:

•

Our Board of Directors is divided into three staggered classes (although our Board of Directors is currently being destaggered);

•

Only our Board of Directors can fill vacancies on the board;

•

There are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and

Page 30


•

Our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares.

These types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. Accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares.

Dividends

Our policy is to use cash flows from operations to fund future growth, pay down debt, and, subject to market conditions, repurchase common stock under a stock buy-back program approved by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, we have not paid a cash dividend since fiscal 1984.  Although our Board of Directors periodically reviews and considers the merits of paying cash dividends, we currently have no plans to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Critical Accounting Policies

In order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, a reader of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements.

The consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing long-term engineering and construction-type contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities. Although our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 –

Significant Accounting Policies

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Accounting for Contracts and Use of Joint Ventures

—In general, we recognize revenues at the time we provide services. Depending on the commercial terms of the contract, we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred, or using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion. This method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress as of the balance sheet dates. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate the possible effects of variances in schedule; the costs of materials and labor; productivity; and the impact of change orders, claims, contract disputes, and achievement of contractual performance standards. Many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. For contracts containing incentive fee arrangements, fees are frequently based on achievement of target completion dates, target costs, and/or other performance criteria. Failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non-recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues recognized from the project.

We provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known, without regard to the percentage of completion. For multiple contracts with a single customer we account for each contract separately.

The nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible. In those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract, we include in the total estimated costs of the contract (and therefore, the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract) an estimate, based on all relevant facts and circumstances available, of the additional costs to be incurred. Similarly, and in the normal course of business, we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible. In those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients, we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred, without profit, to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue, and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims.

Certain cost-reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment. In this situation, revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts. In those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs that are not allowable under the terms of the contract, we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly.

As is common to the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums. Although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients, the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners, or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures. The assets of our joint ventures, therefore, consist almost entirely of cash and receivables (representing amounts due from clients), and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners (for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts) and other subcontractors. In general, at any given time, the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients. Very few of our joint ventures have employees. None of our joint ventures have

Page 36


third-party debt or credit facilities. Our joint ventures, therefore, are simply mechanisms used to deliver engineering and construction services to clients. Rarely do they, in and of themselves, present any risk of loss to us or to our partners separate from those that we would carry if we were performing the contract on our own. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of losses associated with the contracts held by the joint ventures, if and when they occur, has always been reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In evaluating the Company's joint ventures (also referred to as "variable interest entities", or "VIEs") for accounting and consolidation purposes, we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not the Company has a “controlling financial interest” in the VIE. The Company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE if it has (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (ii) the right to receive benefits, or obligation to absorb losses, that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  In making our qualitative analysis, the Company assesses each VIE to determine those activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and whether the Company, another entity, or multiple entities have the power to direct those activities.

If we determine that we have the power to direct those activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its financial performance and have the right or obligation to receive benefits or absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE, then we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE and we consolidate the VIE. If we determine that we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE or power is shared by two or more unrelated parties, then we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not consolidate the VIE.

For the Company's unconsolidated joint ventures, we use either the equity method of accounting or proportional consolidation. The Company does not currently participate in any significant VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest.  There were no changes in facts and circumstances in the period that caused the Company to reassess the method of accounting for its VIEs.

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and Others

— We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Like all option-pricing models, the Black-Scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions including (i) the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock, and (ii) the expected term of the award, among others. Accordingly, changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause drastically different fair values to be assigned to our stock option awards. For restricted stock units containing service and performance conditions with measures external to the Company, compensation expense is based on the fair value of such units determined using Monte Carlo Simulations. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the use of assumptions and the results of applying Monte Carlo Simulations, the amount of expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effects on our future consolidated financial statements because equity awards tend to vest over several years and additional equity awards may be made in the future.

Accounting for Pension Plans

— The accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. The actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in Note 6 –

Pension Plans

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2015 range from 4.5% to 8.5% compared to 0.4% to 8.5% for the prior year. We believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2015 reflects the long-term returns expected on the plans’ assets, considering recent market conditions, projected rates of inflation, the diversification of the plans’ assets, and the expected real rates of market returns. The discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 0.4% to 9.3% in fiscal 2013 to a range of 1.8% to 8.8% in fiscal 2014. These assumptions represent the Company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled.

Changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities, and the associated pension expense. For example, if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation (“PBO”) at September 26, 2014, was higher (lower) by 0.5%, the PBO would have been lower (higher) at that date by approximately $92.0 million for non-U.S. plans, and by approximately $21.1 million for U.S. plans. If the expected return on plan assets was higher (lower) by 1.0%, the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2015 would be lower (higher) by approximately $8.8 million for non-U.S. plans, and by approximately $3.8 million for U.S. plans.  Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance (i.e., actuarial gains and losses) that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period

Page 37


in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used.

Contractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations, and Insurance

— In the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. The guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance. Most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers’ compensation; personal injury; environmental; employment/labor; professional liability; and other similar lawsuits. We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. We have elected, however, to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs. This situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured, and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts.

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record in our Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees, litigation, and insurance claims. We include any adjustments to such liabilities in our consolidated results of operations.

In addition, as a contractor providing services to the U.S. federal government and several of its agencies, we are subject to many levels of audits, investigations, and claims by, or on behalf of, the U.S. federal government with respect to contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations, and procurement practices. We adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations.

Testing Goodwill for Possible Impairment

— The goodwill carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is tested annually for possible impairment. In performing the annual impairment test, we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level. We have determined that we have two reporting units, which are based on geography. We refer to these reporting units internally as “Europe” and “Non-Europe”.  Each of our reporting units conducts the business activities described elsewhere in this 2014 Form 10-K, which includes providing professional technical services such as design, engineering, and architectural services; construction and/or construction management services; and operations and maintenance services.

Our geography-based reporting units reflect the Company’s organizational structure, which is based predominately on geography, as well as our acquisition strategy, which favors acquisition targets that, among other things, provide access to new geographic areas. Our reporting units represent rational groupings into which substantially all of our major acquisitions (which are responsible for the goodwill appearing in our Consolidated Balance Sheets) have been assimilated, and where all of the operations under each reporting unit share in the benefits of the goodwill created by our acquisitions.

U.S. GAAP does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units.  The valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others.

Page 38


For fiscal years 2013 through 2014, we used both an income approach and a market approach to test our goodwill for possible impairment.  Such approaches require us to make estimates and judgments. Under the income approach, fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units. Under the market approach, the fair value of our reporting units is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units; the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies. In assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired, we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated.  The fair values for each reporting unit exceeded the respective book values by over

40%

.  The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units in our testing were:

Income Approach

2013 Assumptions:

•

Company financial projections for fiscal years 2013 to 2016

•

Weighted average cost of capital of 11%

•

Residual period growth rate of 3%

2014 Assumptions:

•

Company financial projections for fiscal years 2014 to 2018

•

Weighted average cost of capital of 11%

•

Residual period growth rate of 3%

Market Approach

With respect to the market approach, for guideline publicly traded companies reasonably comparable to the Company's reporting units, the Company used multiples ranging from 6.3 to 8.0 of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and 8.0 to 9.7 of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), for the fiscal year 2013 test applied to the projected fiscal year 2013 financial results for each of our reporting units.  The Company used multiples ranging from 5.9 to 7.6 of EBITDA and 7.6 to 10.0 of EBIT, for the fiscal year 2014 test applied to the projected fiscal year 2014 financial results for each of our reporting units.

It is possible that changes in market conditions, economy, facts and circumstances, judgments, and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change, resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future.  The fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties.

The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year.  The Company will test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.  We have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012.

Based on the most recent results of our annual impairment tests, there were no indications of impairment of the goodwill shown in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at either September 26, 2014, or September 27, 2013.  Furthermore, the Company performed an interim impairment assessment at September 26, 2014, and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of either reporting unit had been reduced to an amount below its carrying amount.

Fiscal 2014 — Overview

The 2014 Restructuring

During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company commenced a series of initiatives intended to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, accelerate the integration of SKM, and better position the Company to drive growth of the business in the future. We are not exiting any geographic markets or service types, nor exiting any client end-markets as a result of the initiatives. Actions completed during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014 included involuntary terminations, the abandonment of certain leased offices, and the co-location of employees. Included in the Company's consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2014 are pre-tax costs of

$93.3 million

relating to the 2014 restructuring effort (the "2014 Restructuring"). The costs of the 2014 Restructuring are included in selling, general, and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings net of a

$23.6 million

reduction in bonus plan expense. The following table summarizes the effects of the 2014 Restructuring on the Company's consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2014 (in thousands, except for earnings (loss) per share):

The Company does not expect to incur any costs for the 2014 Restructuring in fiscal 2015.

The Fiscal 2014 Acquisition of Sinclair Knight Merz

On December 13, 2013, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Sinclair Knight Merz Management Pty Limited and Sinclair Knight Merz Holdings Limited (collectively, "SKM"), a provider of engineering, design, procurement, construction and project management services for approximately

$1.2 billion

in cash.  SKM's results of operations have been included in the Company's consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition.  The following table presents SKM's results of operations included in the Company's consolidated results of operations for fiscal


(in thousands, except per share amounts):

Results of Operations

General

Our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional services and field services to a large number of industrial, commercial, and governmental clients around the world. The services we provide generally fall into four broad categories:

•

Project Services (including engineering, design, architecture, interiors, planning, environmental, and similar services);

•

Process, Scientific, and Systems Consulting Services (including services performed in connection with scientific testing, analysis, and consulting activities, as well as information technology and systems engineering and integration activities);

•

Construction Services (encompassing traditional field construction services as well as modular construction activities, direct hire construction, and construction management services); and

•

Operations and Maintenance Services (including services performed in connection with operating large, complex facilities on behalf of clients, as well as services involving process plant and facilities maintenance).

The scope of services we can provide our clients, therefore, ranges from consulting and conceptual design services (which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project) to complete single-responsibility, design-build contracts, to services required in the post start-up phases of a project such as O&M services.

Page 41


The following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each of the last three fiscal years (in thousands):

Project Services revenues for the year ended

September 26, 2014

,

increased

$598.1 million

, or

10.0%

, from the corresponding period last year.  The increase was due primarily to revenues attributable to SKM. Also contributing to the increases were higher levels of activity in several of industry groups and markets we serve, including Buildings, Chemicals and Polymers, and Refining-Downstream.

Whereas construction revenues for the year ended

September 26, 2014

,

increased

$312.9 million

, or

8.2%

, from the corresponding period last year, revenues from Process, Scientific, and Systems Consulting and O&M services for fiscal 2014 were relatively unchanged from the prior year.  The increase in construction revenues during fiscal 2014 as compared to last year was due primarily to projects for customers operating in the Chemicals and Polymers market and the Mining and Minerals industries in the U.S.

We focus our services on clients operating in select industry groups and markets. We believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit cross-utilization of our resources.  The following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each of the last three fiscal years (in thousands):

Revenues increased

$876.8 million

, or

7.4%

, from

$11.8 billion

for fiscal


to

$12.7 billion

for fiscal


.

Revenues from clients operating in the Chemicals and Polymers industries

increased

$594.2 million

, or

24.9%

, from

$2.4 billion

for fiscal


to

$3.0 billion

for fiscal


.  This

increase

occurred throughout many of the geographic locations in which we operate.  We continue to receive new awards for FEED (front-end engineering design) and pre-FEED services.  We have long-term relationships with numerous chemical companies around the world, and we believe this industry group will provide strong growth opportunities long-term.  We see particularly strong growth potential in North America and the Middle East due to the growing source of available feedstock.  Leveraging our geographic presence as strengthened by the SKM

Page 42


transaction, we were recently awarded a significant professional services contract for what will be the largest chlorine dioxide plant in the world, located in Asia.  Although we see good growth opportunities for this element of our business, particularly as they relate to methanol, derivatives, and other projects, we continue to see owners take a measured approach to releasing succeeding phases of their capital projects.

Revenues from clients operating in the Infrastructure market

increased

$345.7 million

, or

34.0%

, from

$1.0 billion

for fiscal


to

$1.4 billion

for fiscal


.  SKM contributed approximately 50.0% of the increase, with the U.K. and U.S. legacy operations contributing to the remainder of the

increase

.  We see this market as strong, particularly in several of the sub-markets within this industry group, particularly for transportation and water projects.   One example is the Asset Management Programme (AMP6) cycle in the U.K., where we believe the Company is well positioned to assist clients improve their relative efficiency and wastewater effluent quality.  We also see increasing momentum behind transportation infrastructure projects in many of the geographies in which we operate.  Also included in this revenue category is our growing services to customers operating in the telecommunications industry.  Long-term, we see this market as attracting significant capital as countries around the world strive to improve and expand their wireless communications capabilities.

Revenues from clients operating in the Buildings market

increased

$95.7 million

, or

13.0%

, from

$738.4 million

for fiscal


to $

834.1 million

for fiscal


.  Although SKM was responsible for most of this

increase

, the Company saw growth in our U.S. and Middle East markets. We also see growth potential in parts of North Africa where we believe we are well portioned to capitalize on buildings projects with high technical content (e.g., health care, aviation, and education). We view the Buildings market as improving as our business continues to shift towards projects for clients in the private sector.

Revenues from clients operating in the Mining and Minerals markets

increased

$206.3 million

, or

29.0%

, from

$712.3 million

for fiscal


to

$918.6 million

for fiscal


.  The

increased

revenues in 2014 was due primarily to SKM. Globally, our clients in these industries continue to behave conservatively when it comes to new spend. In addition, although we believe consolidation among companies in this industry will provide more stable capital spending in the long-term, such actions may have significant impacts in the short-term. Nevertheless, we believe we will be able to capture additional market share from clients operating in these industries by continuing to focus on asset optimization and sustaining capital projects (small-cap projects and maintenance-driven work) for our clients. In addition, we expect the SKM acquisition to expand our capabilities beyond non-ferrous metals to iron ore and coal and to bring together our existing hydro-metallurgy and concentrator skills with SKM's strength in materials handling and infrastructure.

Revenues from clients operating in the Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology markets

decreased

$70.8 million

, or

13.5%

, from

$523.5 million

for fiscal


to

$452.7 million

for fiscal


. The decrease in revenues were due primarily to the normal wind-down and completion of projects, including work on several vaccine plants located in North America.  Although revenues from clients operating in these industries have declined over the preceding three fiscal years, we have seen a recent increase in new project awards, as well as indications from certain clients of increasing captial investment.  We continue to view these industries as improving with prospects in the area of biotechnology-based drug development, principally in North America, and secondary manufacturing expansion, primarily in India and Asia.

The Industrial and Other category includes projects for clients operating in the Pulp & Paper, High-Technology Manufacturing, Power, and Food, Beverage & Consumer Products industries.  Revenues in this category

decreased

$141.7 million

, or

15.8%

, from

$899.8 million

for fiscal


to

$758.0 million

for fiscal


.  The

decrease

in Industrial and Other revenues were due primarily to

decreased

activity in the Pulp & Paper market in the U.S. and the High-Technology Manufacturing market in Ireland.

Direct costs of contracts

increased

$645.3 million

, or

6.5%

, from

$9.98 billion

during fiscal


to

$10.62 billion

during fiscal


. Direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts, including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in connection with providing the services required by client projects. The level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of pass-through costs we incur during a period. On those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs (and we refer to such costs as “pass-through costs”). On other projects, where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items, these amounts are not considered pass-through costs and are, therefore, not reflected in either revenues or costs. To the extent that we incur a significant amount of pass-through costs in a period, our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well.

Pass-through costs increased

$330.0 million

, or

12.6%

, from

$2.62 billion

during fiscal


to

$2.95 billion

for fiscal


. In general, pass-through costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities.  Pass-

Page 43


through costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects. However, because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year, the effect of pass-through costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business.

As a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were

83.7%

for fiscal


, compared to

84.4%

for fiscal


. The relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided. Generally speaking, the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients (i.e., where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects, and/or procure subcontracts in connection with projects) and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical, professional services revenues, the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues. Because revenues from pass-through costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them, it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit. The ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues over the prior year period

decreased

, primarily as a result of higher margins in both professional technical services and field services activities and the acquisition of SKM.

Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for fiscal


increased

by

$372.4 million

, or

31.7%

, to

$1.55 billion

, compared to

$1.17 billion

for fiscal


.  The

increase

in SG&A expenses reflects the effects of the 2014 Restructuring discussed above as well as the results of operations of SKM. Also included in SG&A expenses for the current fiscal year are transaction-related expenses incurred in connection with the SKM acquisition of

$9.2 million

. Also included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2014 are due diligence and other transaction-related costs incurred in connection with other mergers and acquisition activity.

Net interest expense for fiscal


decreased

$5.8 million

to

$1.7 million

from

$7.5 million

in fiscal


. The

decrease

is related to the reassessment during fiscal


of a tax matter involving one of our international subsidiaries which resulted in the reversal of $8.1 million of accrued interest, offset in part by the net impacts of the SKM acquisition.

The Company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was

35.1%

for fiscal


, compared to

33.5%

in fiscal


. Contributing to the increase as compared to the prior year was the effect of the 2014 Restructuring. Also contributing to the higher effective tax rate is the stamp duty paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 related to the SKM acquisition.

Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012

We recorded net earnings of $423.1 million, or $3.23 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2013, compared to $379.0 million, or $2.94 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2012.

Revenues increased $924.6 million, or 8.5%, from $10.9 billion for fiscal 2012 to $11.8 billion for fiscal 2013.

Revenues from clients operating in the Chemicals and Polymers industries increased $686.4 million, or 40.3%, from $1.7 billion for fiscal 2012 to $2.4 billion for fiscal 2013.  The effect of shale gas projects and the low price of natural gas influenced activity in the chemicals market in fiscal 2013. Furthermore, our clients were looking at various options to monetize natural gas.  This increased activity occurred primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. along with smaller increases in the Middle East and Asia.

Revenues from clients operating in the Refining—Downstream market decreased $42.4 million, or 1.8%, from $2.38 billion for fiscal 2012 to $2.34 billion for fiscal 2013.  Included in revenues for fiscal 2012 were a significant amount of pass-through costs for a large U.S. based project that was winding down during fiscal 2012.  Notwithstanding these decreases, we had strong sales in this market during fiscal 2013.  Several downstream companies have announced large capital projects and the industry is beginning to focus on compliance with the EPA TIER 3 Ultra Low Sulfur Gasoline regulations where we believe we are well positioned to support our clients with the required facility modifications.

National Government Programs revenues for fiscal 2013 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2012.  Uncertainties over U.S. government budget issues and ongoing sequestration concerns remained a primary driver limiting our growth in this market.  These actions had little effect on the Company's projects in backlog in this market during fiscal 2013.  We believe that sequestration slowed the release of new project opportunities in this market.  Nevertheless, we had significant Aerospace and Defense awards in this market during fiscal 2013.  In addition, certain changes in government contracting in the U.S. helped to stabilize this area of our business.  We saw an increasing volume of work released by U.S. government agencies in the form of

Page 44


multiple award task order contracts ("MATOC").  These types of awards allow the Company to bid on, and participate in, more government sites than large, single-award contracts.

Revenues from clients operating in the Infrastructure market decreased $69.8 million, or 6.4%, from $1.09 billion for fiscal 2012 to $1.02 billion for fiscal 2013.  We had significant wins in the U.S. market in fiscal 2013.  The partial U.S. federal government shutdown added some uncertainty to our U.S. infrastructure market, though we experienced little short-term disruption.

Revenues from clients operating in the Oil and Gas—Upstream market increased $124.9 million, or 15.8%, from $790.5 million for fiscal 2012 to $915.5 million for fiscal 2013.  These increases were primarily a result of improvement in the Canadian oil and gas business, particularly in field services.  We saw more opportunities in the Middle East, including unconventional gas development programs and large pipeline FEED projects.  Onshore development and production in the U.S. continued to be strong.  The Australian market was being driven by the development of liquefied natural gas export projects.

Revenues from clients operating in the Buildings market decreased $105.5 million, or 12.5%, from $844.0 million for fiscal 2012 to $738.4 million for fiscal 2013.  The state of the U.S. economy impacted this market. Our Buildings business continued to shift towards projects for clients in the private sector.  Opportunities in the private sector business came from mission critical, education, healthcare, aviation, and corporate and commercial programs and projects.

Revenues from clients operating in the Mining and Minerals market increased $162.2 million, or 29.5%, from $550.1 million for fiscal 2012 to $712.3 million for fiscal 2013.  Generally, our clients in this market were affected negatively by a general slowdown in the rate of growth in the Chinese economy; falling spot prices for iron ore, coking, and thermal coal; and weaker commodity prices - albeit these declines occurred from prices that were generally high from a historical perspective.  These trends resulted in clients reducing their capital spending in the Mining and Minerals market.  Despite this cooling market, we were able to capture additional market share during fiscal 2013.  The increase in revenues in this market in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily from projects based out of the U.S.

Revenues from clients operating in the Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology markets decreased $52.8 million, or 9.2%, from $576.3 million for fiscal 2012 to $523.5 million for fiscal 2013. Though several of our customers delayed projects, this market was fairly stable for us in fiscal 2013.

Revenues from clients operating in the Industrial and Other markets increased $209.6 million, or 30.4%, from $690.1 million for fiscal 2012 to $899.8 million for fiscal 2013.  The increases in Industrial and Other revenues were due primarily to increased activity in the Pulp & Paper market in the U.S. and the High-Technology Manufacturing market in Ireland.

Direct costs of contracts increased $809.3 million, or 8.8%, from $9.17 billion during fiscal 2012 to $9.98 billion during fiscal 2013.  Pass-through costs increased $296.4 million, or 12.7%, from $2.33 billion during fiscal 2012 to $2.62 billion for fiscal 2013.

As a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were 84.4% for fiscal 2013, compared to 84.1% for fiscal 2012.   The increase in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was due primarily to a slight decrease in margins for our professional services offset by improved margins for our field services.

SG&A expenses for fiscal 2013 increased by $42.4 million, or 3.8%, to $1.17 billion, compared to $1.13 billion for fiscal 2012.  The increase in SG&A is primarily reflective of the Company's increased business activity when compared to fiscal 2012. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A costs declined for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012.

Interest expense for fiscal 2013 increased $1.2 million to $12.9 million from $11.7 million in fiscal 2012. Interest expense in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 was due primarily to the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Aker Entities. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2013 when compared to fiscal 2012 is related primarily to the accrual of interest related to a potential tax liability from an acquisition completed in fiscal 2012.

The Company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 33.5% for fiscal 2013, compared to 34.1% in fiscal 2012. The Company's lower effective income tax rate in fiscal 2013 when compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2012 was due primarily to an increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Contractual Obligations

The following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of September 26, 2014 (in thousands):

(a)

Assumes the Company will make the end of lease term residual value guarantee payment of $38.8 million in 2015 with respect to the lease of an office building in Houston, Texas.   Please refer to Note 10—

Commitments and Contingencies, and Derivative Financial Instruments

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(b)

Assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal 2015, allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases, but limited to the amount recorded as of September 26, 2014. Actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors, including amounts required by local laws and regulations, and other funding requirements.

(c)

Assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal 2014, allowing for certain growth. Due to the nonqualified nature of the plans, and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service, the payments included in the schedule were limited to the amount recorded as of September 26, 2014.

(d)

Represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of September 26, 2014; primarily accounts payable and accrued payroll.

(e)

Determined based on borrowings outstanding at the end of fiscal 2014 using the interest rates in effect at that time and, for our outstanding long term debt, concluding with the expiration date of the 2014 Facility, as defined below.

Backlog

Backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. With respect to O&M contracts, however, we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract. For national government programs (other than U.S. federal O&M contracts), our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, excluding option periods.

The following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years (in millions):

The entire value of contract awards are added to backlog when the contracts are awarded to us. Accordingly, backlog can fluctuate from one reporting period to the next due to the timing of when new contracts are added to backlog and when the contract revenue is recognized in our consolidated financial statements. Many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years). Our backlog at

September 26, 2014

increased

by

$1.2 billion

, or

6.7%

, to

$18.4 billion

from

$17.2 billion

at

September 27, 2013

.  The

increase

in backlog from

September 27, 2013

to

September 26, 2014

was due primarily to the acquisitions of SKM and FNS, combined with new awards from clients operating in the Refining-Downstream, Infrastructure, and Chemicals and Polymers industry groups and markets, among others.

In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client. In a situation where a client terminates a contract, we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and, in certain instances, we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs. There were no significant project cancellations in fiscal


.

While management uses all information available to it to determine backlog, our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. Accordingly, backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues.

Backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the U.S. federal government and its agencies totaled approximately

$4.8 billion

(or

26.1%

of total backlog),

$4.1 billion

(or

23.9%

of total backlog), and

$3.6 billion

(or

22.9%

of total backlog) at

September 26, 2014

,

September 27, 2013

, and

September 28, 2012

, respectively. Most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year. In general, these contracts must be funded annually (i.e., the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the U.S. Congress to the procuring agency, and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts).

Subject to the factors discussed in Item 1A—

Risk Factors

, above, we estimate that approximately

9.1 billion

, or

49.3%

, of total backlog at

September 26, 2014

will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year.

Effects of Inflation

The effects of inflation on our business is discussed in Item 1A—

Risk Factors

, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At

September 26, 2014

, our primary sources of liquidity consisted of

$0.7 billion

of cash and cash equivalents and

$0.8 billion

of available borrowing capacity under our

$1.60 billion

revolving credit facility (the "2014 Facility").  Additional information regarding the 2014 Facility is set forth in Note 5 -

Borrowings

in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We finance as much of our operations and growth as possible through cash generated by our operations.

During fiscal


, our cash and cash equivalents

decreased

by

$0.5 billion

from

$1.26 billion

at

September 27, 2013

to

$0.7 billion

at

September 26, 2014

. This compares to a net

increase

in cash and cash equivalents of

$223.9 million

during the corresponding period last year.  During fiscal


, we experienced net cash

inflows

of

$721.7 million

from operating activities

Page 47


and

$304.9 million

from financing activities.  These cash

inflows

were offset by cash

outflows

of

$1,518.8 million

from investing activities and

$31.6 million

from the effects of exchange rate changes.

Operations

provided

net cash of

$721.7 million

during fiscal


. This compares to net cash

inflows

of

$448.5 million

and

$299.8 million

during fiscal


and


, respectively. The

$273.2 million

increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


was due primarily to a

$327.5 million

favorable change in the Company's working capital accounts partially offset by a

$88.1 million

decrease

in net earnings attributable to the Group and a

$28.5 million

change related to the Company's defined benefit pension plans.

Because such a high percentage of our revenues are earned on cost-plus type contracts, and due to the significance of revenues relating to pass-through costs, most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients. Although we continually monitor our accounts receivable, we manage the operating cash flows of the Company by managing the working capital accounts in total, rather than by the individual elements.  The primary elements of the Company’s working capital accounts are accounts receivable, accounts payable, and billings in excess of cost. Accounts payable consists of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients.  Accounts receivable consist of billings to our clients — a substantial portion of which is for project-related costs. Billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred.

This relationship between revenues and costs, and between receivables and payables is unique to our industry, and facilitates review of our liquidity at the total working capital level.  The changes in cash flows relating to our working capital accounts were due simply to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts and is not indicative of any known trend or fundamental change to the underlying business.  We still continue to experience delays in certain payments and have seen an increase in the length of payment terms with certain customers.  We believe that this situation does not present a significant risk to the Company's cash flows.  We believe the risk of not collecting substantially all of the Company's outstanding receivables is remote.  Though the Company provides services in a number of countries outside the U.S., we believe our credit risk is not significant.  Our private sector customers are comprised principally of large, well known, and well established multi-national companies.  Our government customers are comprised of national, state, and local agencies located principally in the U.S. and the U.K.  We have not historically experienced significant collection issues with either of our governmental or non-governmental customers.

We

used

$1.5 billion

of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal


. This compares to

$157.1 million

and

$181.1 million

during fiscal


and


, respectively.  This increase was primarily the result of the Company's acquisition of SKM for $1.2 billion ($1.1 billion net of cash acquired) in fiscal


and compares to minimal acquisition activity in fiscal 2013 and 2012.

Additions to property and equipment totaled

$132.1 million

,

$127.3 million

, and

$102.6 million

for fiscal years


,


, and


, respectively.  Included in fiscal


and


activity are significant expenditures for leasehold improvements relating primarily to the consolidation of certain office space, expansion of office space and relocations of certain office space, all occurring in a number of locations.

Our financing activities resulted in net cash

inflows

of

$304.9 million

during


as compared to net cash

outflows

of

$59.7 million

and

$2.7 million

during fiscal


and


, respectively.  In connection with our acquisition of SKM, we borrowed $600.0 million under our prior facility (the "2012 Facility").  See Note 5 -

Borrowings

in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Amounts borrowed to complete the SKM acquisition that were still outstanding on the date we closed the 2014 Facility were paid-off and re-borrowed under the 2014 Facility.  On August 19, 2014, the Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to $500 million of the Company's common stock over the next three years.  Under the program’s terms, shares may be repurchased from time to time at the our discretion on the open market, through block trades or otherwise.  The timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions, other uses of capital and other factors.

The Company had

$0.7 billion

of cash and short term equivalents at

September 26, 2014

. Of this amount, approximately

$263.3 million

was held in the U.S. and

$469.3 million

was held outside of the U.S., primarily in Canada, the U.K., and the Eurozone.  Other than the tax cost of repatriating funds held outside the U.S. to the U.S. (see Note 9—

Income Taxes

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), there are no impediments to repatriating these funds to the U.S.

The total amount utilized under the 2014 Facility at

September 26, 2014

was

$766.9 million

(

$764.1 million

in the form of direct borrowings and

$2.8 million

utilized in the form of letters of credit).  Please refer to Note 5—

Borrowings

of

Page 48


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the 2012 facility and the 2014 Facility.

We believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations, support our acquisition strategy, and service our debt for the next twelve months. We had

$0.7 billion

in cash and cash equivalents at

September 26, 2014

, compared to

$1.26 billion

at

September 27, 2013

.  Our consolidated working capital position at

September 26, 2014

was

$1.5 billion

; a

decrease

of

$609.7 million

from

September 27, 2013

.

Additionally, there was

$0.8 billion

of borrowing capacity available at

September 26, 2014

under the 2014 Facility. We believe that the remaining capacity, terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility, combined with cash on-hand and the other committed and uncommitted facilities we have in place, are adequate for our working capital and general business requirements.

The Company had

$315.4 million

of letters of credit outstanding at

September 26, 2014

.  Of this amount,

$2.8 million

were issued under the 2014 Facility and

$312.6 million

were issued under separate, committed and uncommitted letter-of-credit facilities.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business. However, such off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or resources that is material to investors. See Note 10 –

Commitments and Contingencies, and Derivative Financial Instruments

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

New Accounting Pronouncements

From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issues accounting standards updates (each being an "ASU") to its Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), which constitutes the primary source of U.S. GAAP. The Company regularly monitors ASUs as they are issued and considers their applicability to its business. All ASUs applicable to the Company are adopted by the due date and in the manner prescribed by the FASB. A discussion of those recently issued ASUs most likely to affect the presentation of the Company's consolidated financial statements follows.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09—

The new guidance provided by ASU 2014-09 is intended to remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in the existing revenue requirements, provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improve comparability, provide more useful information and simplify the preparation of financial statements. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements.

In December 2011, the FASB adopted ASU No. 2011-11—

Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.

ASU 2011-11 amends Topic 210 of the ASC and requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of their financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on their respective financial positions.  The scope of this ASU includes derivatives, sale and repurchase agreements, reverse sale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending agreements.  Entities are required to apply the provisions of ASU 2011-11 for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.  The Company does not believe that the adoption of ASU 2011-11 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the Company to market risk. In the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates.

Interest Rate Risk

Please refer to the discussion of the 2014 Facility and the 2012 Facility in the liquidity and capital resources discussion in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and Note 5 -

Borrowings

in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on Page F-1 of this Annual report on Form 10-K.

Foreign Currency Risk

In situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. In those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. We follow the provisions of ASC 815-10 -

Derivatives and Hedging

in accounting for our derivative contracts. The Company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as of

September 26, 2014

, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the Evaluation Date.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date based on the framework established in “

Internal Control—Integrated Framework”

, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date were effective. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting which appears later in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended

September 26, 2014

, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Page 50


Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed or operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met. The design of the Company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints, and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation

Description of Business

We provide a broad range of technical, professional, and construction services including engineering, design, and architectural services; construction and construction management services; operations and maintenance services; and process, scientific, and systems consulting services.  We provide our services through offices and subsidiaries located primarily in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Australia, Africa, and Asia.  We provide our services under cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts.  The percentage of revenues realized from each of these types of contracts for each of the last three fiscal years was as follows:

Basis of Presentation, Definition of Fiscal Year, and Other Matters

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates which it controls.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to September 30 (determined on the basis of the number of workdays) and, accordingly, an additional week of activity is added every

five

-to-

six

years.

Please refer to Note 16—

Definitions

for the definitions of certain terms used in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Accounting for Contracts and Use of Joint Ventures

In general, we recognize revenues at the time we provide services.  Depending on the commercial terms of the contract, we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred, or using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion.  Contract losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known, without regard to the percentage-of-completion.  For multiple contracts with a single customer we account for each contract separately.  We also recognize as revenues costs associated with claims and unapproved change orders to the extent it is probable that such claims and change orders will result in additional contract revenue, and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated.

Certain cost-reimbursable contracts include incentive-fee arrangements.  The incentive fees in such contracts can be based on a variety of factors but the most common are the achievement of target completion dates, target costs, and/or other performance criteria.  Failure to meet these targets can result in unrealized incentive fees.  We recognize incentive fees based on expected results using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.  As the contract progresses and more information becomes available, the estimate of the anticipated incentive fee that will be earned is revised as necessary.  We bill incentive fees based on the terms and conditions of the individual contracts.  In certain situations, we are allowed to bill a portion of the incentive fees over the performance period of the contract.  In other situations, we are allowed to bill incentive fees only after the target criterion has been achieved.  Incentive fees which have been recognized but not billed are included in receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

F-8


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Certain cost-reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment.  In this situation, revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts.  Revenues are not recognized for non-recoverable costs.  In those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract, we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly.

When we are directly responsible for subcontractor labor or third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs (and we refer to such costs as “pass-through” costs).  On those projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items, these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs.

The following table sets forth pass-through costs included in revenues for each of the last three fiscal years (in millions):

As is common to the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums.  Although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients, the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners, or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures.  The assets of our joint ventures, therefore, consist almost entirely of cash and receivables (representing amounts due from clients), and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners (for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts) and other subcontractors.  In general, at any given time, the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients.  Very few of our joint ventures have employees.  None of our joint ventures have third-party debt or credit facilities.  Our joint ventures, therefore, are simply mechanisms used to deliver engineering and construction services to clients.  Rarely do they, in and of themselves, present any risk of loss to us or to our partners separate from those that we would carry if we were performing the contract on our own.  Under U.S. GAAP, our share of losses associated with the contracts held by the joint ventures, if and when they occur, has always been reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Certain of our joint ventures meet the definition of a VIE.  In evaluating our VIEs for possible consolidation, we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not we have a “controlling financial interest” in the VIE as defined by U.S. GAAP.  We consolidate only those VIEs over which we have a controlling financial interest.

For the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures, we use either the equity method of accounting or proportional consolidation.  The Company does not currently participate in any significant VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest that it does not consolidate.

There were no changes in facts and circumstances during the period that caused the Company to reassess the method of accounting for its VIEs.

Fair Value Measurements

The net carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables, and notes payable approximate Fair Value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.  Similarly, we believe the carrying value of long-term debt also approximates Fair Value based on the interest rates and scheduled maturities applicable to the outstanding borrowings.  Certain other assets and liabilities, such as forward contracts and an interest rate swap agreement we purchased as cash-flow hedges discussed in Note 10

—

Commitments and Contingencies - Derivative Financial Instruments

are required to be carried in our Consolidated Financial Statements at Fair Value.

The Fair Value of the Company’s reporting units (needed for purposes of determining whether there is an indication of possible impairment of the carrying value of goodwill) is determined using a both an income approach and a market approach.  Both approaches require us to make estimates and judgments.  Under the income approach, Fair Value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units.  Under the market approach, the Fair Values of our reporting units are determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units; the Fair Values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies.  In assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired, we utilize the results of both valuation

F-9


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

techniques and consider the range of Fair Values indicated.  The range of values (both ends of the range) for each reporting unit, exceeded the respective book values by more than

40%

.

With respect to share-based payments, we estimate the Fair Value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  Like all option-pricing models, the Black-Scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions including (i) the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock, and (ii) the expected term of the award, among others.  Accordingly, changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause drastically different Fair Values to be assigned to our stock option awards.  For restricted stock units containing service and market conditions, compensation expense is based on the Fair Value of such units using a Monte Carlo simulation.  Due to the uncertainties inherent in the use of assumptions and the results of applying Monte Carlo simulations and because equity awards tend to vest over several years and additional equity awards may be made in the future, the amount of expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effects on our future consolidated financial statements.

The Fair Values of the assets owned by the various pension plans that the Company sponsors are determined based on the type of asset, consistent with U.S. GAAP.  Equity securities are valued by using market observable data such as quoted prices.  Publicly traded corporate equity securities are valued at the last reported sale price on the last business day of the year.  Securities not traded on the last business day are valued at the last reported bid price.  Debt securities are valued at the last reported sale price on the last business day applicable.  Real estate consists primarily of common or collective trusts, with underlying investments in real estate.  They are valued using the best information available, including quoted market price, market prices for similar assets when available, internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate, or independent appraisals, as appropriate.  Insurance contracts, investments in infrastructure/raw goods, and hedge funds are valued using actuarial assumptions and values reported by the fund managers.

The methodologies described above and elsewhere in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements may produce a Fair Value measure that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future Fair Values.  Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the Fair Value of certain financial instruments could result in a different Fair Value measurement.

Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents at

September 26, 2014

and

September 27, 2013

consisted primarily of money market mutual funds and overnight bank deposits.

Receivables and Billings in Excess of Costs

“Receivables” include billed receivables, unbilled receivables, and retentions receivable.  Billed receivables represent amounts invoiced to clients in accordance with the terms of our client contracts.  They are recorded in our financial statements when they are issued.  Unbilled receivables and retentions receivable represent reimbursable costs and amounts earned and reimbursable under contracts in progress as of the respective balance sheet dates.  Such amounts become billable according to the contract terms, which usually consider the passage of time, achievement of certain milestones or completion of the project.  We anticipate that substantially all of such unbilled amounts will be billed and collected over the next fiscal year.

Certain contracts allow us to issue invoices to clients in advance of providing services.  “Billings in excess of costs” represent billings to, and cash collected from, clients in advance of work performed.  We anticipate that substantially all such amounts will be earned over the next

twelve

months.

Property, Equipment, and Improvements

Property, equipment and improvements are carried at cost, and are shown net of accumulated depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Depreciation and amortization is computed primarily by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the related lease.  Estimated useful lives range from


to


years for buildings, from


to


years for equipment and from


to


years for leasehold improvements.

JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the Fair Value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.  Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; instead, we test goodwill for possible impairment.  We conduct such tests annually (or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the Fair Values of our reporting units below their respective carrying values).  The first step in the test is to compare the Fair Value of each of the Company’s reporting units to their respective carrying amounts, including goodwill.  In the event that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its Fair Value, a second test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.  In performing the annual impairment test, the Company evaluates goodwill at the reporting unit level.  We have determined that our operating segment is comprised of

two

reporting units based on geography.  Based on the results of these tests, we have determined that the Fair Value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for fiscal years


,


, and


.

The following table provides certain information related to the Company’s acquired intangible assets for each of the fiscal years presented (in thousands):

The weighted average amortization period includes the effects of foreign currency translation.

The above table excludes the values assigned to those intangible assets embedded in the Company’s investment in AWE Management Ltd. (“AWE”) and Guimar Engenharia LTDA ("Guimar").  Those amounts are included in the carrying value of the Company’s investment in AWE and Guimar.  The amount of amortization expense we estimate we will record during each of the next five fiscal years relating to intangible assets existing at

September 26, 2014

, including those associated with AWE and Guimar, is: fiscal

$52.9 million

; fiscal

$51.5 million

; fiscal


-

$49.0 million

; fiscal


-

$47.5 million

; and fiscal


-

$46.7 million

.  The amounts reported for future amortization include the effect of exchange rate changes.

The change in goodwill during the three year period ending

September 26, 2014

was due primarily to businesses acquired during fiscal


.

Business Combinations

On December 13, 2013, the Company acquired all of the outstanding interests in Sinclair Knight Merz Management Pty Limited and Sinclair Knight Merz Holdings Limited (collectively, "SKM"), a provider of engineering, design, procurement, construction and project management services.  The Company purchased SKM for approximately

$1.2 billion

in cash. The acquisition agreement includes customary representations, warranties, and indemnities supported by an escrow account.  SKM's results of operations have been included in the Company's consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition.

F-11


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company has, in total, incurred approximately

$16.6 million

of expenses directly related to the SKM acquisition.  Included in selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal


is

$9.2 million

of incremental, transaction-related expenses.

The following table presents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price (in thousands) paid for SKM:

The Company expects to collect substantially all of the acquired receivables of

$304.6 million

, net of acquired allowances.

The purchase price allocation of the SKM transaction continues to be subject to post-closing adjustment as the Company finalizes the values assigned to project-related assets and liabilities, claims, other contingencies, acquired intangible assets, and leased properties, among other items.  The Company intends to complete the purchase price allocation by the end of the measurement period provided by U.S. GAAP.  The preliminary useful lives of the intangible assets acquired from SKM range from


to


years.

Some of the factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill include: (i) access to a large, highly-trained and stable workforce; (ii) the opportunity to expand our client base in Australia, Asia, South America and the U.K.; (iii) the opportunity to expand our presence in multiple industries, including: mining, infrastructure, buildings, water and energy; and (iv) the opportunity to achieve operating synergies.  We expect that a significant portion of the the goodwill recognized in the SKM transaction will ultimately be deductible in the U.S. for federal income tax purposes.

The following table presents the unaudited, pro forma consolidated results of operations (in millions, except per share amounts) for fiscal years


and


as if the acquisition of SKM operations had occurred as of

September 28, 2012

.  The period end dates of SKM are different from those of the Company and, accordingly, certain adjustments were made to conform SKM's period end dates to those of the Company.  Management believes these adjustments make the comparative data more representative of what the combined results of operations would have been over the pro forma period.  The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of (i) the results of operations that would have occurred had we actually acquired SKM on

September 28, 2012

; or (ii) future results of operations:

The pro forma earnings for fiscal year


were adjusted to exclude

$21.4 million

of transaction-related costs incurred by both parties and, for fiscal year


, include

$21.4 million

of transaction-related costs in the pro forma earnings.

JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

For fiscal years


and


,  the pro forma earnings were adjusted to reduce interest expense by

$2.3 million

(for a total of

$2.1 million

) and to include incremental interest expense of

$5.4 million

(for a total of

$5.4 million

), respectively.  For fiscal years


and


, the pro forma earnings were adjusted to include net incremental intangible amortization of

$2.5 million

(for a total of

$19.9 million

) and

$16.1 million

(for a total of

$21.3 million

), respectively.  The difference in the total intangible amortization between the periods is due to the effects of exchange rate changes.

The  pro forma earnings for fiscal year


include an expense from SKM of

$24 million

related to a settlement with certain SKM shareholders regarding provisions of their shareholding plan that was settled and paid prior to the close of the business combination and recorded during the

three

month period ended

December 27, 2013

.

During fiscal year


, the Company also acquired Federal Network Services LLC (formerly a subsidiary of Verizon), Eagleton Engineering, LLC, FMHC Corporation, Stobbarts (Nuclear) Limited, Trompeter Enterprises, and MARMAC Field Services, Inc.  The operations of these acquisitions were not material to the Company's consolidated results for fiscal


.  During fiscal


, we also acquired an additional

15%

interest in Zamel and Turbag Consulting Engineers Company ("ZATE"), a refining, chemicals, infrastructure and civil engineering company headquartered in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia. This transaction brought the Company's ownership in ZATE to

75%

.

Foreign Currencies

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, it is necessary to translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the U.S., which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar.  In accordance with U.S. GAAP, revenues and expenses of operations outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates for the applicable period(s) being translated while the assets and liabilities of operations outside the U.S. are generally translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates.  The net effect of foreign currency translation adjustments is included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Share-Based Payments

We measure the value of services received from employees and directors in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date Fair Value of the award.  The computed value is recognized as a non-cash cost on a straight-line basis over the period the individual provides services, which is typically the vesting period of the award with the exception of awards containing an internal performance measure which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period subject to the probability of meeting the performance requirements and adjusted for the number of shares expected to be earned.  The cost of these awards is recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following table presents our stock-based compensation expense for the various types of awards made by the Company for each of the fiscal years presented (in thousands):

The Company has

two

incentive plans whereby eligible employees and directors of Jacobs may be granted stock options, restricted stock, and/or restricted stock units.

Stock Options

—Substantially all of the stock options granted during the year are awarded on the same date (although the date is different for employees and directors).  The following table presents the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model during each of the last three fiscal years for awards made to employees and directors:

Performance Awards

—

During fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, the Company granted restricted stock units containing service, performance, and market conditions.  The restricted stock unit award is split equally between Relative TSR Restricted Stock Units and Net Earnings Growth Restricted Stock Units.

The number of Relative TSR Restricted Stock Units in which the employee may ultimately vest shall be equal to the Relative TSR grant multiplied by the TSR Performance Multiplier.  The TSR Performance Multiplier will be determined by comparing the Company's total stockholder return to the total stockholder return of each of the companies in a specified industry peer group over the

three

-year period immediately following the award date.  For purposes of computing total stockholder return, the beginning stock price will be the average closing stock price over the


calendar day period ending on the award date ("Performance Period"), and the ending stock price will be the average closing price over the


calendar day period ending on the last day of the performance period.  Any dividend payments made over the Performance Period will be deemed re-invested on the ex-dividend data in additional shares of the related Company.

The following table presents the basis on which the Relative TSR Restricted Stock Units are determined:

If the Company's total stockholder return over the Performance Period falls between any of the brackets described above, the TSR Performance Multiplier will be determined using straight line interpolation based on the actual percentile ranking.

Substantially all of the TSR restricted stock units awarded during the year are awarded on the same date.  The following table presents the assumptions used to value the TSR restricted stock units:

The number of Net Earnings Growth Restricted Stock Units awarded in fiscal year 2012 in which an employee may ultimately vest shall be equal to the sum of the following:  (1) an amount, not less than zero, equal to one-third of the earned Net Earnings Growth Restricted Stock Units grant multiplied by the Net Earnings Growth Performance Multiplier (or, "NEGPM", as defined) determined based upon the growth in the Company's Net Earnings (as defined) over the period from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013; plus, (2) an amount, not less than zero, equal to (A) two-thirds of the earned Net Earnings Growth Restricted Stock Units grant multiplied by the NEGPM determined based upon the average growth in the Company's Net Earnings over the period from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2014, minus (B) the amount determined pursuant to (1) above; plus, (3) an amount, not less than zero, equal to (A) the earned Net Earnings Growth Restricted Stock Units grant multiplied by the NEGPM determined based upon the average growth in the Company's Net Earnings over the period from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2015, minus (B) the amount determined pursuant to (1) and (2) above.

For Net Earnings Growth Restricted Stock Units awarded in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, all of the criteria referenced in the paragraph above are the same over the

three

year vesting period with the exception of the performance period. The

periods for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 are based upon the Company's Net Earnings (as defined) over the period starting on the first day of the Company's third quarter of fiscal 2013 and ending on the last day of the Company's second quarter of fiscal 2016 and the Company's Net Earnings (as defined) over the period starting on the first day of the Company's third quarter of fiscal 2014 and ending on the last day of the Company's second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively.

If the Company's average growth in Net Earnings over the applicable fiscal years during the respective performance periods is between

5%

and

10%

,

10%

and

15%

, or

15%

and

20%

, the Net Earnings Growth Performance Multiplier will be determined using straight line interpolation based on the actual average growth in the Company's consolidated net earnings attributable to Jacobs.

The following table presents the basis on which the Net Earnings Growth Restricted Stock Units are determined:

Unless stated otherwise, all other awards are valued based on the closing price of the Company's common stock as reported in the NYSE Composite Price History on their respective grant dates.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Our cash balances and cash equivalents are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Australia, Africa, and Asia.  In the normal course of business, and consistent with industry practices, we grant credit to our clients without requiring collateral.  Concentrations of credit risk is the risk that, if we extend a significant amount of credit to clients in a specific geographic area or industry, we may experience disproportionately high levels of default if those clients are adversely affected by factors particular to their geographic area or industry.  Concentrations of credit risk relative to trade receivables are limited due to our diverse client base, which includes the U.S. federal government and multi-national corporations operating in a broad range of industries and geographic areas.  Additionally, in order to mitigate credit risk, we continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our major commercial clients.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to employ estimates and make assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities; the revenues and expenses reported for the periods covered by the financial statements; and certain amounts disclosed in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Although such estimates and assumptions are based on management’s most recent assessment of the underlying facts and circumstances utilizing the most current information available and past experience, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.  Our estimates, judgments, and assumptions are evaluated periodically and adjusted accordingly.

Earlier in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements we discussed three significant accounting policies that rely on the application of estimates and assumptions: revenue recognition for long-term construction contracts; the process for testing goodwill for possible impairment; and the accounting for share-based payments to employees and directors.  The following is a discussion of certain other significant accounting policies that rely on the use of estimates:

Accounting for Pensions

— We use certain assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the assets and liabilities of our pension plans.  These assumptions involve discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others.  Changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material effect on the plans’ liabilities and the projected pension expense.

F-15


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Accounting for Income Taxes

— We determine our consolidated income tax expense using the asset and liability method prescribed by U.S. GAAP.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes.  Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.  If and when we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realized for its full amount, we will recognize and record a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to earnings.  Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  In the normal course of business, we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain.  Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions.  Our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the U.S., and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the U.S.

Contractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations, and Insurance

— In the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation.  We record in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees, litigation, and insurance claims.  We perform an analysis to determine the level of reserves to establish for both insurance-related claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurance-related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis, but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates.  We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  In addition, as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the U.S. federal government, we are subject to many levels of audits, investigations, and claims by, or on behalf of, the U.S. federal government with respect to contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations, and procurement practices.  We adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations.

Accounting for Business Combinations

— U.S. GAAP requires that the purchase price paid for business combinations accounted for using the acquisition method be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective Fair Values.  Determining the Fair Value of contract assets and liabilities acquired often requires estimates and judgments regarding, among other things, the estimated cost to complete such contracts.  The Company must also make certain estimates and judgments relating to other assets and liabilities acquired as well as any identifiable intangible assets acquired.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09—

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

. The new guidance provided by ASU 2014-09 is intended to remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in the existing revenue requirements, provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improve comparability, provide more useful information and simplify the preparation of financial statements. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements.

In December 2011, the FASB adopted ASU No. 2011-11—

Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.

ASU 2011-11 amends Topic 210 of the ASC and requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of their financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on their respective financial positions.  The scope of this ASU includes derivatives, sale and repurchase agreements, reverse sale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending agreements.  Entities are required to apply the provisions of ASU 2011-11 for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.  The Company does not believe that the adoption of ASU 2011-11 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

3. Employee Stock Purchase and Stock Option Plans

Broad-Based, Employee Stock Purchase Plans

Under the 1989 ESPP and the GESPP, eligible employees who elect to participate in these plans are granted the right to purchase shares of the common stock of Jacobs at a discount that is limited to

5%

of the per-share market value on the day shares are sold to employees.  The following table summarizes the stock issuance activity under the 1989 ESPP and the GESPP during each of the last three fiscal years:

At

September 26, 2014

, there remains

1,860,820

shares reserved for issuance under the 1989 ESPP and

212,185

shares reserved for issuance under the GESPP.

Stock Incentive Plans

We also sponsor the 1999 SIP and the 1999 ODSP.  The 1999 SIP provides for the issuance of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, share appreciation rights ("SAR"), restricted stock, and restricted stock units to employees.  The 1999 ODSP provides for awards of shares of common stock, restricted stock, and restricted stock units, and grants of nonqualified stock options to our outside (i.e., nonemployee) directors.  The following table sets forth certain information about the 1999 Plans:

Effective September 28, 2012, all grants of shares under the 1999 SIP are issued on a fungible share basis.  An award of an option or SAR counts as

1.00

share issued under the 1999 SIP Plan.  A grant other than an option or SAR counts as

1.92

shares issued under the 1999 SIP Plan.

The authorization for the share repurchase program may be terminated, increased or decreased by the Company’s Board of Directors in its discretion at any time.

5. Borrowings

Short-Term Credit Arrangements

The Company maintains both committed and uncommitted credit arrangements with several banks providing for short-term borrowing capacity and overdraft protection.  There were overdrafts of

$36.7 million

outstanding under these short-term credit facilities at a weighted average interest rate of

6.4%

at

September 26, 2014

, and there were overdrafts of

$22.8 million

outstanding under these short-term credit facilities at

September 27, 2013

Long-term Debt

On February 7, 2014, Jacobs and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a

$1.6 billion

long-term unsecured, revolving credit facility (the "2014 Facility") with a syndicate of large, U.S. and international banks and financial institutions. The 2014 Facility replaced and refinanced the Company's previous

$1.21 billion

unsecured revolving credit facility originally entered into by the Company on March 29, 2012 (the "2012 Facility").  On the closing date of the 2014 Facility, all amounts outstanding and committed under the 2012 Facility were effectively terminated and refinanced under the 2014 Facility.  The 2014 Facility also provides an accordion feature that allows the Company and the lenders to increase the facility amount to

$2.1 billion

.  The 2014 Facility did not change interest rates for borrowings outstanding under the 2012 Facility, but did reduce the fees on the unused portion of the facility.

The following table presents certain information regarding the Company’s long-term revolving credit facilities at

September 26, 2014

, and

September 27, 2013

(dollars in thousands):

The total amount outstanding under the 2014 Facility in the form of direct borrowings at

September 26, 2014

was

$0.8 billion

.  The Company has issued

$2.8 million

in letters of credit leaving

$0.8 billion

of available borrowing capacity under the 2014 Facility at

September 26, 2014

.  In addition, the Company had

$312.6 million

issued under separate, committed and uncommitted letter-of-credit facilities for total issued letters of credit of

$315.4 million

at

September 26, 2014

.

The 2014 Facility expires in February 2019 and permits the Company to borrow under

two

separate tranches in U.S. dollars, certain specified foreign currencies, and any other currency that may be approved in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Facility.

Depending on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio, borrowings under the 2014 Facility will bear interest at either a eurocurrency rate plus a margin of between

1.0%

and

1.5%

or a base rate plus a margin of between

0%

and

0.5%

. The 2014 Facility also provi

des for a financial letter of credit subfacility of

$300.0 million

, permits performance letters of credit, and provides for a

$50.0 million

subfacility for swingline loans. Letters of credit are subject to fees based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio at the time any such letter of credit is issued. The Company pays a facility fee of between

0.100%

and

0.25%

per annum depending on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Amounts outstanding under the 2014 Facility may be prepaid at the option of the Company without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage fees in connection with the prepayment of eurocurrency loans. The 2014 Facility contains affirmative, negative, and financial covenants customary for financings of this type including, among other things, limitations on certain other indebtedness, loans and investments, liens, mergers, asset sales and transactions with affiliates. In

addition, the 2014 Facility contains customary events of default. We were in compliance with our debt covenants at

September 26, 2014

6. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Company-Only Sponsored Plans

We sponsor various defined benefit pension plans covering employees of certain U.S. and international subsidiaries.  The pension plans provide pension benefits that are based on the employee’s compensation and years of service.  Our funding policy is to fund the actuarially determined accrued benefits where applicable, allowing for projected compensation increases using the projected unit method.

The accounting for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic benefit cost and the value of the plans’ assets and benefit obligations.  These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, amongst others.  The discount rates used in valuing the plans' benefit obligations were determined with reference to high quality corporate/government bonds that are appropriately matched

F-21


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

to the duration of each plan's obligations.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally based on using country-specific simulation models which select a single outcome for expected return based on the target asset allocation.  The expected long-term-rates of return used in the valuation are the annual average returns generated by these assumptions over a


year period for each asset class based on the expected long-term rate of return of the underlying assets.

JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We consider various factors in developing the estimates for the expected, long-term rates of return on plan assets.  These factors include the projected, long-term rates of returns on the various types of assets in which the plans invest, as well as historical returns.  In general, investment allocations are determined by each plan’s trustees and/or investment committees.  The objectives of the plans’ investment policies are to (i) maximize returns while preserving capital; (ii) provide returns sufficient to meet the current and long-term obligations of the plan as the obligations become due; and (iii) maintain a diversified portfolio of assets so as to reduce the risk associated with having a disproportionate amount of the plans’ total assets invested in any one type of asset, issuer or geography.  None of our pension plans hold Jacobs common stock directly (although some plans may hold shares indirectly through investments in mutual funds).  The plans’ weighted average asset allocations at

Multiemployer Plans

In Canada and the U.S., we contribute to various trusteed pension plans covering hourly construction employees under industry-wide agreements.  We also contribute to various trusteed plans in Australia and certain countries in Europe covering both hourly and certain salaried employees.  Contributions are based on the hours worked by employees covered under these agreements and are charged to direct costs of contracts on a current basis.

The majority of the contributions the Company makes to multiemployer pension plans is outside the U.S.  With respect to these multiemployer plans, the Company's liability to fund these plans is generally limited to the contributions we are required to make under collective bargaining agreements.

Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Multiemployer Plans

, we have concluded that none of the multiemployer pension plans into which we contribute are individually significant to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

8. Savings and Deferred Compensation Plans

Savings Plans

We sponsor various defined contribution savings plans which allow participants to make voluntary contributions by salary deduction.  Such plans cover substantially all of our domestic, nonunion employees in the U.S. and are qualified under Section 401(k) of the U.S. IRC.  Similar plans outside the U.S. cover various groups of employees of our international subsidiaries and affiliates.  Several of these plans allow the Company to match, on a voluntary basis, a portion of the employee contributions.  The following table presents the Company’s contributions to these savings plans during each of the last three fiscal years (in thousands):

Deferred Compensation Plans

Our Executive Security Plan and Executive Deferral Plans are nonqualified deferred compensation programs that provide benefits payable to directors, officers, and certain key employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future dates, upon retirement, or death.  Benefit payments under both plans are funded by a combination of contributions from participants and the Company, and most of the participants are covered by life insurance policies with the Company designated as the beneficiary.  The following table presents the amount charged to expense for the Company’s deferred compensation plans during each of the last three fiscal years (in thousands):

10. Commitments and Contingencies, and Derivative Financial Instruments

Commitments Under Operating Leases

We lease certain of our facilities and equipment under operating leases with net aggregate future lease payments of approximately

$1.1 billion

at

September 26, 2014

, payable as follows (in thousands):

We recognize rent expense, inclusive of landlord concessions and tenant allowances, over the lease term on a straight-line basis.  We also recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis for leases containing fixed escalation clauses and rent holidays.  Contingent rentals are included in rent expense as accruable.  Operating leases relating to many of our major offices generally contain renewal options, and provide for additional rental based on escalation in operating expenses and real estate taxes.

The following table presents rent expense and sublease income offsetting the Company’s rent expense during each of the last three fiscal years (in thousands):

Guarantee

We are party to a synthetic lease agreement involving certain real and personal property located in Houston, Texas that we use in our operations.  A synthetic lease is a type of off-balance sheet transaction which provides us with certain tax and other financial benefits.  Significant terms of the lease are as follows:

The lease agreement gives us the right to request an extension of the lease term.  We may also assist the owner in selling the property at the end of the lease term, the proceeds from which would be used to reduce our residual value guarantee.  In connection with the lease, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement with a U.S. bank which fixes the amount of the Company’s lease payments.  The notional amount of this hedge at

September 26, 2014

, was

$52.2 million

.  This instrument allows us to receive a floating rate payment tied to the 1-month LIBOR from the counterparty in exchange for a fixed-rate payment from us.  We have determined this interest rate swap to be “highly effective” according to U.S. GAAP.  The minimum lease payments required by the lease agreement is included in the above lease pay-out schedule.  We have determined that the estimated Fair Value of the aforementioned financial guarantee was not significant at

September 26, 2014

.  The Company is currently exploring refinancing options with respect to the lease agreement.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Derivative Financial Instruments

In situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs.  In those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies.  The Company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

Letters of Credit

Letters of credit outstanding at

September 26, 2014

totaled

$315.4 million

.  Of this amount,

$2.8 million

has been issued under the 2014 Facility and

$312.6 million

are issued under separate, committed and uncommitted letter-of-credit facilities.

11. Contractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations, and Insurance

In the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation.  The guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance.  Most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers' compensation; personal injury; environmental; employment/labor; professional liability; and other similar lawsuits.

We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations.  Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to not pay any claims we might make.  We have also elected to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs.  As a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured.  We intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts.  Our insurers are also subject to business risk and, as a result,

one

or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise.

Additionally, as a contractor providing services to the U.S. federal government and several of its agencies, we are subject to many levels of audits, investigations, and claims by, or on behalf of, the U.S. federal government with respect to our contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations, and procurement practices.  Furthermore, our income, franchise, and similar tax returns and filings are also subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states within the U.S. as well as by various government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the U.S.

We record in our Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims, guarantees, litigation, and audits and investigations.  We perform an analysis to determine the level of reserves to establish for insurance-related claims that are known and have been asserted against us, and for insurance-related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis, but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates.  We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations.

Management believes, after consultation with counsel, that such guarantees, litigation, U.S. government contract-related audits, investigations and claims, and income tax audits and investigations should not have any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

On August 9, 2014, the Company received a Notice of Arbitration from Motiva Enterprises LLC.  The Arbitration is pending in Houston, Texas before the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution.  In 2006, Motiva contracted with Bechtel-Jacobs CEP Port Arthur Joint Venture (“BJJV”), a joint venture between Bechtel Corporation and Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.  to perform professional services in connection with the expansion project at the Motiva Port Arthur, TX refinery.  In the Notice of Arbitration, Motiva asserts various causes of action and  alleges entitlement to equitable and monetary relief in excess of

$7 billion

.  BJJV has denied liability and is vigorously defending these claims.  The Company does not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.

The Company is a defendant in a property damage lawsuit pending in North Carolina's Superior Courts arising out of a June 9, 2009, natural gas explosion at a ConAgra Foods Inc. plant in Garner, Wake County, North Carolina. The Company has settled the personal injury claims and is vigorously defending the property damage claim and believes it has meritorious defenses.  In addition, the Company believes it has adequate insurance coverage as well as a right to indemnification from ConAgra.  Accordingly, the Company does not expect these matters to have any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.

14. Segment Information

We provide a broad range of technical, professional, and construction services including engineering, design, and architectural services; construction and construction management services; operations and maintenance services; and process, scientific, and systems consulting services.  We provide our services through offices and subsidiaries located primarily in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Australia, Africa, and Asia.  We provide our services under cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts.

All of our operations share similar economic characteristics.  For example, all of our operations are highly influenced by the general availability of qualified engineers and other technical professional staff.  They also provide similar services as well as share similar processes for delivering our services.  There is also a high degree of similarity of the workforces employed among the various categories of services we provide.  For example, engineering and design services (i.e., services provided by persons who are degreed, and in certain circumstances licensed, professionals such as engineers, architects, scientists, and economists) exist in all

four

service categories.  In addition, there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and operations and maintenance projects.  In providing construction and operations and maintenance services, we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel.  These include welders, pipe fitters, electricians, crane operators, and other personnel who work on very large capital projects (in the case of projects classified within the construction services category) or on smaller capital projects (in the case of maintenance projects classified within the operations and maintenance services category).  In addition, the use of technology is highly similar and consistent throughout our organization, as is our client base (with the exception of our operations outside the U.S., which perform very little work for the U.S. federal government), and our quality assurance and safety programs.  Furthermore, the types of information and internal reports used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker and other members of management to monitor performance, evaluate results of operations, allocate resources, and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment.  Accordingly, based on these operational similarities and the way management monitors the Company’s results of operations, we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into

one

reportable segment for purposes of this disclosure.

“1999 SIP” means the Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Stock Incentive Plan, as amended.  The 1999 SIP is a shareholder-approved, equity-based compensation plan covering the Company's officers and key employees.

The "2014 Restructuring" refers to a series of initiatives intended to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, accelerate the integration of SKM, and better position the Company to drive growth of the business in the future. Actions included involuntary terminations, the abandonment of certain leased offices, and the co-location of employees. Included in the Company's consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2014 are pre-tax costs of

$93.3 million

relating to the 2014 Restructuring. These costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

“ASC” refers to the Accounting Standards Codification as maintained by the FASB.  The ASC is the primary source of U.S. GAAP to be applied by the Company and all other nongovernmental entities.

The accounting principles promulgated by the ASC are organized therein by broad topics, and is updated by the FASB through the issuances of ASUs.

“ASU” means Accounting Standards Updates, the primary means by which the ASC is updated by the FASB.

“Company” (including “we”, “us” or “our”) means Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates.

“Consolidated EBITDA" generally means consolidated net earnings attributable to Jacobs, plus consolidated (i) interest expense, (ii) tax expense, and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense (including amortization expense relating to intangible assets).

“Fair Value” means the price that would be received from selling an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the date fair value is determined (i.e., the “measurement date”).  When determining fair value, U.S. GAAP requires that we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact any sale or purchase.  U.S. GAAP also requires that the inputs (factors) we use (consider) to determine fair value be considered in the following order of priority:

•

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

•

Level 2 inputs are observable inputs (other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1) such as (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in markets that have insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (i.e., less active markets), and (iii) model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated with, observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement.

“FASB” means the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  The FASB is the designated organization within the U.S. for establishing standards of financial accounting that govern the preparation of financial reports by nongovernmental entities.

“GESPP” means the Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended.  The GESPP is a shareholder-approved, broad-based, employee stock purchase plan covering employees of certain of Jacobs' non-U.S. subsidiaries.

“Group” refers to the combined economic interests and activities of Jacobs and the persons and entities holding noncontrolling interests in the subsidiaries and affiliates that are consolidated into the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

“Jacobs” means Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.

“U.S. GAAP” means those accounting principles and practices generally accepted in the United States.

“U.S. IRC” means the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

“VIE” means a “Variable Interest Entity” as defined in U.S. GAAP.  A VIE is a legal entity in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or, as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack any one of the following three characteristics: (i) the power, through voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of a legal entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the legal entity; or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the legal entity.  Accordingly, entities issuing consolidated financial statements (i.e., a “reporting entity”) shall consolidate a VIE if the reporting entity has a “controlling financial interest” in the VIE, as demonstrated by the reporting entity having both (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (ii) the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 26, 2014 and September 27, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 26, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and subsidiaries at September 26, 2014 and September 27, 2013, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 26, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated November 21, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.

We have audited Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria). Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2014, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 26, 2014 and September 27, 2013 and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 26, 2014 of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and subsidiaries and our report dated November 21, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
