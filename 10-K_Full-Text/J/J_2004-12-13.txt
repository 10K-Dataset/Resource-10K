PART I

Item 1.    BUSINESS

General

Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 8, 1987. On March 4, 1987, it succeeded by
merger to the business and assets of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., a California corporation that, in 1974, had succeeded to a business organized originally by Dr. Joseph J. Jacobs in 1947. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references
herein to “Jacobs” or the “Registrant” are to Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and its predecessors, and references to the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our” are to both Jacobs Engineering Group
Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Registrant’s common stock has been publicly held since 1970 and is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

We are one of the largest professional services firms in the United States. Our business focuses exclusively on providing a broad
range of technical, professional, and construction services to a large number of industrial, commercial, and governmental clients around the world. We provide project services (which include engineering, design, architectural, and similar services);
process, scientific, and systems consulting services; operations and maintenance services; and construction services (which include direct-hire construction and construction management services). We provide our services through offices and
subsidiaries located principally in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

We concentrate our services on selected industry groups and markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; U.S. federal programs; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; chemicals and polymers; buildings (which includes
projects in the fields of health care and education as well as civic, governmental, and other buildings); infrastructure; technology and manufacturing; and pulp and paper, among others.

Business Strategy

General

There are four major components of our business strategy:
a relationship-based approach to client interactions, a strong focus on cost control, an organizational structure that facilitates efficient project management and execution, and safety.

Relationship-Based Business Model

Our relationship-based business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability. We aggressively pursue the development of long-term affiliations and alliances with our clients. By working as a partner with our
clients on their capital programs, we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects. This allows us the opportunity to provide a greater range of services to our clients. We
market all of our services to clients for projects where the scope of work required is within our expertise. By integrating and bundling our services (i.e., providing design, engineering, and construction services on the same project), we can price
contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering superior value to our clients. Our relationship-based business model also helps us more fully understand the risks inherent in the projects, which in turn allows us to
manage those risks better. Our approach also provides us with opportunities to market those services our clients will need in the post start-up and commissioning phases of a plant, such as operations and maintenance services. This model, however,
does not preclude us from undertaking discrete projects that do not significantly conflict with our business strategy. We will accept and perform discrete projects for our clients if we can negotiate acceptable pricing and other contract terms and
conditions.

Page 2


Cost Control

Another important component of our business strategy is our continual emphasis on cost control. As the global economy expands and companies are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries, the company
that can provide its clients with cost efficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage. Our attention to cost control throughout every level of our organization allows us to deliver superior technical, professional, and construction
services safely, efficiently, and within the cost and time parameters our clients require.

Organizational Structure

Our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering our services is
another key component of our business strategy. Our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by our various technical engineering, design and construction disciplines that
are necessary to effectively execute long-term contracts. Crucial functions, such as project controls and procurement, are local to each of our major locations and serve operations by providing the specialized services required. In addition, we
actively employ a boundaryless approach to the way we serve our clients. Our operating groups do not compete against each other for contracts. Rather, our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work cohesively while
simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services.

Safety

The final key component of our business
strategy is our intense and uncompromising focus on safety. Maintaining safe work environments has long been a mutual and unequivocal condition of the relationship we have with our employees. It is also a paramount issue in our dealings with our
clients. A safe work environment is critical to our long-term success and growth. We maintain a centralized quality and safety group to help ensure that we provide services safely and in accordance with standard work processes. Unsafe job sites and
office environments increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, and raise our operating costs as well. Safe job sites and office environments, on the other hand, benefit our clients, promote employee morale, and
enhance the long-term relationships we have with our clients, employees, and business partners.

The Role of Acquisitions in Our Business Strategy

Our relationship-based business model is a significant driver of our
acquisition activities. When we review potential acquisition targets, we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base. We favor acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance the range of services we provide our clients,
and/or gain access to new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand. By expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities, we strive to position
ourselves as a preferred, single-source provider of technical, professional, and construction services to our major clients. The following is a brief description of some of our key mergers and acquisitions over the past five years:

•

In August 2004, we acquired the Babtie Group Limited (the “Babtie Group”). The Babtie Group is a leading provider of technical and professional services to clients in the
infrastructure, facilities, environmental, defense, and governmental outsourcing markets, among others. Headquartered in Scotland, the Babtie Group employs approximately 3,500 people in offices located throughout the United Kingdom and Asia, with
smaller operations in India and the Czech Republic. The primary purpose for acquiring the Babtie Group was to expand our infrastructure and facilities business in the United Kingdom.

Page 3


•

In October 2001, we acquired McDermott Engineers & Constructors (Canada) Limited (including Delta Catalytic and Delta Hudson Engineering) (collectively, “Delta”). Delta provides
engineering, construction, and maintenance services to various industries including upstream oil and gas, petroleum refining, petrochemicals, and chemicals. Delta employed approximately 3,500 employees conducting operations located primarily in
Canada.

•

In May 2001, we purchased from LawGibb Group Inc. substantially all of its international engineering and construction management business (the “GIBB businesses”). Headquartered in
the United Kingdom, the GIBB businesses are a leading international engineering consultancy firm that provides technical, professional, and construction management services in the fields of transportation, civil and structural engineering, water and
wastewater, environmental and geotechnical services, infrastructure, building and building services, information technology, defense, finance, and commerce. The GIBB businesses employed approximately 900 employees conducting operations located
primarily in the United Kingdom and certain other European countries.

•

In February 2001, we finalized the second phase of a two-part transaction to acquire from Stork N.V., the Netherlands, all of its engineering and contracting business (the “Stork E&C
businesses”). We completed the first phase of the transaction (“Stork Phase I”) in February 2000. The Stork Phase I entities employed approximately 1,500 technical professional staff in offices located principally in Belgium, Germany,
Southeast Asia, and certain locations in the Netherlands. The second phase of the transaction (“Stork Phase II”) involved Stork N.V.’s engineering and construction management operations in the Netherlands and the Middle East. The
Stork Phase II entities employed approximately 500 technical professional staff. The Stork E&C businesses, headquartered in Leiden, the Netherlands, provide a broad range of engineering and construction management services to clients in the
refining, chemicals, basic resources, and facilities industries, among others.

•

In fiscal 1999, we merged with the Sverdrup Corporation (“Sverdrup”). As a result of this transaction, Sverdrup became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jacobs. Headquartered in St.
Louis, Missouri, Sverdrup provides engineering, architecture, construction, and scientific services for the development, design, construction, and operation of buildings, infrastructure projects, and advanced technical systems for public and private
sector clients in the United States and internationally. At the time of the merger, Sverdrup employed approximately 5,600 people in offices located throughout the United States and in selected countries abroad. The Sverdrup transaction expanded our
business opportunities in several key markets (e.g., infrastructure and defense), added professional staff, and provided us with presence in new geographic areas.

Services Provided

As we discussed
above, our business is to provide technical, professional, and construction services. The services we provide generally fall into four broad categories: project services (which includes engineering, design, architectural, and similar services);
construction services; operations and maintenance services; and process, scientific, and systems consulting services. The scope of services we can provide our clients, therefore, ranges from consulting and conceptual design services, which clients
often require in the very early stages of a project, to complete, single-responsibility, design-build-operate contracts.

Page 4


The following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the five fiscal
years ended September 30 (in thousands of dollars):

Certain amounts for fiscal years
2003 and 2002 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Project Services

We employ all of the engineering, design, architectural, and related disciplines needed to design and
engineer:

•

modern process plants (including projects for clients in the chemicals and polymers, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, oil & gas, refining, food and consumer products, and basic
resources industries);

•

buildings (including facilities in the health care, education, and criminal justice markets, as well as other buildings for clients in the private sector);

•

infrastructure projects (including highways, roads, bridges, and other transportation systems, and wastewater treatment and similar facilities);

•

technology and manufacturing facilities (for clients in the semiconductor, electronics, automotive, pulp and paper, aerospace, and defense industries);

•

and other similar facilities.

We also employ the requisite scientific, technical, and program management capabilities necessary to provide program integration, testing, and evaluation services
for clients in the defense and aerospace industries. Our services include provision of IT services to the United States federal government in support of information systems and technology centers and scientific/technical services for various
agencies of the United States federal government in support of environmental programs.

In the area of construction management, we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients. We may act as the program director, whereby we oversee, on the owner’s behalf, the complete
planning, design, and construction phases of the project; alternatively, our services may be limited to providing construction consulting.

Also included in the category of “Project Services” are construction related services (such as cost engineering, planning, scheduling, procurement,
estimating, project accounting, and quality and safety) necessary to support our engineering, design, construction, construction and program management, operations and maintenance, and consulting services.

Construction

We provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industries to which we provide project services. We
also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology. Our modular approach is an advanced form of off-site engineering and design, fabrication, assembly, and field erection. A modular approach provides clients with an

Page 5


alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction, which can compress and shorten the construction schedule. In the environmental area, we
provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients.

Historically, our field construction activities have focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and
design work. In doing so, we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties. The financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared
by third parties may be particularly significant on fixed-price contracts; therefore, we generally avoid this type of project. However, we continue to pursue construction-only projects where we can negotiate pricing and other acceptable contract
terms.

Operations and Maintenance (“O&M”)

O&M generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large, complex facilities on behalf of clients. In such situations, we can provide key
management and support services over all of the facility’s operations, including subcontractors and other on-site personnel. Within the environmental area, O&M often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program
management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites. Within the aerospace and defense areas, O&M often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain engine test facilities,
weapons integration, and high-tech simulation and verification centers. Such O&M contracts also frequently require us to provide construction support services, facilities management and maintenance services, utilities operations and maintenance
services, and property management and disposition services.

This
category also includes plant maintenance services, which generally involves the tasks required to keep a plant (typically a refinery or chemical plant) in day-to-day operation. This would include, for example, the repair and replacement of pumps,
piping, heat exchangers, and other equipment as well as “turnaround” work, which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down. Since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant, turnaround work
often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel that can work efficiently on a project on a 24-hours-per-day, seven-days-per-week basis. We use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects
quickly, and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects.

Although the gross profit margins that we realize from O&M services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide, the costs to
support maintenance activities are also generally lower. Furthermore, we view O&M contracts as presenting a lower financial risk to the Company as compared to some of the other services we provides because O&M contracts are normally
cost-reimbursable in nature. Additionally, although engineering and construction projects may be of a short-term nature, O&M services often result in long-term relationships with clients. For example, we have been providing maintenance services
at several major process plants for over 30 years. This aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services.

Process, Scientific and Systems Consulting

We employ all of the
professional and technical expertise necessary to provide a broad range of consulting services, including:

•

performing pricing studies, market analyses, and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project;

•

performing gasoline reformulation modeling; analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants;

Page 6


•

analyzing automation and control systems; analyzing, designing, and executing biocontainment strategies;

•

developing and performing process protocols with respect to Federal Drug Administration-mandated qualification and validation requirements;

•

providing consultation on proposed railway and airport expansion projects;

•

and performing geological and metallurgical studies.

Also included in the category of “Process, Scientific and Systems Consulting” are the professional and program management services required to assist
clients (such as the United States federal government and its agencies) in a wide range of defense and aerospace related programs. Such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than are other project services we provide, and
may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems; weapons modeling and simulations; computer systems development, maintenance, and support; evaluation and testing of mission-critical control systems;
and other highly technical programs and tasks.

Complementary Nature of Resources
and Business Systems Utilized

There is a high degree of similarity of the workforces among our service categories. For example, engineering
and design services (i.e., services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed, such as engineers, architects, scientists, and economists) exist in all four service categories. In addition, there is a high degree of
similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform on O&M and construction projects. In providing O&M and construction services, we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel. These may include
welders, pipe fitters, electricians, crane operators, and other personnel that work on very large capital projects (in the case of projects classified within the construction services category) or on smaller capital projects (in the case of
maintenance projects classified within the O&M services category).

Our operating units use a matrix organizational structure. Our results, therefore, are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines (e.g., electrical engineering, chemical engineering, cost engineering, aerospace engineering,
etc.) supporting project management personnel (who maintain the relationship between us and our clients, and who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely, on time, and on budget). Additionally, all of our operating
regions and divisions use common tools, policies, and procedures to manage and run their respective businesses. These include practices concerning such things as project review meetings, project performance evaluations, and project execution plans.

The use of technology throughout our organization is uniform. Whether it
is computer aided design and drafting (“CADD”) applications used by our engineering and design staff; or modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff; or scheduling, estimating, and cost control applications used by
home-office personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities, all of the service categories described above are equally vulnerable to changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large.

Industry Groups and Markets

We focus our services on clients that operate in the following industry groups and markets: oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; United States federal
programs; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; chemicals and polymers; buildings (both public and private sector); infrastructure; technology and manufacturing; and pulp and paper. We also provide services to clients in other industries and markets,
such as food and consumer products, and basic resources (e.g., mining, minerals, and fertilizers), among others. We believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit cross-utilization of our resources and help to
mitigate the negative effects of a downturn in a single industry.

Page 7


The following table sets forth our revenues from each of these industry groups and markets for each of the five
fiscal years ended September 30 (in thousands of dollars):

Oil & Gas/Refining

We provide our full line of traditional engineering, design, construction, and management services to our clients in the areas of exploration, production, and
refining. Typical projects in this area include new design and construction, revamps or expansions of existing plants, upgrades of individual process units within refineries, and maintenance services. We also provide a broad range of consulting
services to our clients including process assessments, facility appraisals, feasibility studies, technology evaluations, project finance structuring and support, and multi-client subscription services.

Historically, revenues from our hydrocarbon business related primarily to projects
associated with petroleum refining and the processes and technologies required for the conversion of crude oil and gas into petroleum fuels, chemical feedstocks, and lubricants. More recently, our services and the types of projects we perform have
expanded to include the upstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry. These projects include heavy oil processing projects (e.g., oil sands extraction projects); projects involving oil recovery through steam injection; and gas
treating, gas gathering, and gas storage projects including extraction of commercially valuable elements of the gas stream. A new area of focus is off-shore production, where we are actively pursuing project opportunities in engineering and design
of topside facilities.

Government regulations continue to influence the
need for project services by our clients in the refining industry. We see ongoing project activity in refining due to Tier II gasoline and on-road Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel requirements. We believe new regulations, such as off-road Ultra Low Sulfur
Diesel, and new ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulates will drive new investment requirements in the industry over the next several years. We are actively involved in such regulatory-based projects.

We have also used our modular construction capabilities on a number of projects in the
refining and petroleum industry. In the U.S. and European refining markets, many projects involve the revamp of existing processing units or the addition of new processes to an existing refinery. As a result of the close proximity of processing
units in these refineries, we believe the use of modular construction can decrease congestion at the construction site. Modular construction can also provide cost and project execution benefits in remote locations.

We provide maintenance services to our clients in the refining industry. We have also
established a number of formal alliances with various clients in the refining industry. Some of these alliances are both domestic (U.S.) and international in scope.

Page 8


In this industry group we also include power generation and cogeneration power projects. While this is not a major
focus for us, we provide design, engineering, procurement, construction and construction management, and maintenance services to our clients in the power generation and supply industry. Typical projects in this area include simple and combined cycle
power projects, cogeneration power plants, aeroderivative and industrial gas turbines, and emergency power generation stations. The industry is now focusing on gasification, as high energy prices, the need for hydrogen and power, availability of
lower priced solid fuels, and the potential to sequester CO


emissions make this technology a new area for project development.

Federal Programs

We categorize our Federal Programs as generally relating to environmental, aerospace and defense, or building programs.

Environmental

We are one of the leading providers of environmental engineering and consulting services in the United States and abroad, including hazardous and nuclear waste
management and site cleanup and closure. Many of our projects for the United States federal government span over ten years. Our projects within this market generally relate to all major federal and state environmental statutes, with particular
emphasis on the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We currently provide environmental investigation, restoration, engineering, construction, and site operations and
maintenance services to a number of United States federal government agencies, including the Department of Energy (“DOE”) and the Department of Defense (“DOD”).

As part of our environmental restoration work, we provide support in such areas as underground storage tank removal, contaminated soil
and water remediation, and long-term groundwater monitoring. We also design, build, install, operate, and maintain various types of soil and groundwater cleanup systems at multiple project locations across the United States and its territories for
the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence. Typical projects also include the preparation of feasibility studies and performance of remedial investigations, engineering, design, and
remediation services on several national programs.

We provide a full
range of environmental consulting services including air quality planning and permitting, water quality compliance, environmental conservation studies, pollution prevention assessments, and compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act.

As part of our support to our clients, we provide asset management
services in the form of infrastructure operations and maintenance. This is an integral part of our services for the DOE at the Oak Ridge Environmental Management sites and at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site. Asset management also
includes building closures, which involve deactivation, decommissioning, and demolition of government facilities.

Aerospace and Defense

We provide support to
aerodynamic, propulsion, and space facilities and systems for government clients at more than a dozen test centers across the continental United States. This includes military systems acquisition management and strategic planning; operations and
maintenance of test facilities, ranges, space launch facilities, and space chambers; test and evaluation in computer, laboratory, facility, and range environments; test facility computer systems instrumentation and diagnostics; and test facility
design and build. We also provide systems engineering and integration of complex weapons and space systems as well as hardware and software design of complex flight and ground systems. We support and maintain enterprise information systems for
government and commercial

Page 9


customers worldwide, ranging from the operation of complex computational networks to the development and validation of specific software applications.

We have provided advanced technology engineering services to the DOD for more than 50
years and currently support defense programs in dozens of locations, both within the United Sates and internationally. In addition to operating and maintaining several DOD test centers, our support includes services such as aerodynamic testing of
next-generation fighter aircraft; propulsion testing for space programs; launch support services for the Titan, Atlas, and Delta rockets and payloads; and acquisition support for weapons systems such as air-to-air missile systems and precision
guided smart weapons for high-value targets. We also support the acquisition and development of systems and equipment for Special Operations Forces as well as the development of biological, chemical, and nuclear detection and protection systems. We
also support the DOD in a number of information technology programs including network design, integration, and support; command and control technology; development and sustainment of databases and customized applications; and security solutions.

We provide a broad range of engineering, science, and technical support
services to five NASA centers, delivering support to virtually every major space program including the International Space Station, space shuttle recertification, space observatories, aerospace transportation systems, space propulsion systems,
advanced materials research, and advanced research and development activities such as protein crystal growth experiments for the development of new drugs and vaccines. We also provide operations and maintenance services for NASA aerospace and
propulsion research test facilities.

Buildings

Also included in Federal Programs revenues are building programs we perform for certain agencies of the United States federal government. We provide a wide range
of architectural, engineering, construction, and design-build services to agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), the General Services Administration (“GSA”), the United States Departments of State,
Treasury, Agriculture, and Defense, among others. Typical projects include the renovation and modernization of terminal radar control centers, air traffic control towers, and other facilities for the FAA. We also provide architectural and
engineering services for the United States Pentagon renovation program as well as planning and design services for Internal Revenue Service offices and customer service centers nationwide. More recent contract awards require us to provide design and
program management services in connection with certain homeland security initiatives for the GSA and the Department of Homeland Security. We are providing design/build services for the DOD on military family housing and quality of life projects as
well as maintenance facilities and command and control centers.

Pharmaceuticals
and Biotechnology

We furnish our full line of services to our clients in the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industries including master
planning, programming, feasibility studies, engineering, preliminary and detailed design, procurement, construction, construction management, commissioning and start-up, validation, and maintenance. Accordingly, we believe we are fully capable of
executing the industry’s largest capital programs on a single-responsibility basis.

Typical projects for clients in these industries include laboratories, research and development facilities, pilot plants, bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient production facilities, full-scale biotechnology production
facilities, and secondary manufacturing facilities. In addition to regulatory compliance issues, state-of-the-art technology and expertise are critical to our clients in these industries. Such technology and knowledge encompasses containment,
barrier technology, locally controlled environments, process and building systems automation, and off-the-site design and fabrication of process and building modules.

Page 10


As companies in the pharmaceuticals industry continue to experience pressure to decrease product time-to-market,
reduce costs, and increase return on investment, the types of services we provide have grown over the years to include modular construction as well as consulting and strategic planning to help our clients complete capital projects more quickly and
efficiently. As an example of this process, we increased our efforts to integrate commissioning and validation services, helping reduce the amount of time required to introduce a new drug into the marketplace.

We have cost-effective professional resources located in geographic areas of major
pharmaceutical and biotechnology concentration, and we provide single-point engineering, procurement, construction management, and validation (“EPCMV”) project delivery. We continue to enhance our 3-D design capabilities, project controls,
and automation capabilities as well as other technological aspects of our EPCMV services. This allows us to serve our clients better and to ensure that projects transition from their conceptual design phase through engineering, construction,
start-up, commissioning, and validation phases as economically and efficiently as possible.

We have also established formal alliances and preferred provider agreements with numerous clients in the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industry.

Chemicals and Polymers

The chemicals
and polymers industries remain an important element to our overall growth. Current demand and future opportunities from this market continue to be an essential part of our diversified business. We continue to expand our presence globally to better
meet the needs of our clients as they increase their operations internationally with strong focus in the Middle East and Asia.

The types of projects we execute for our clients in these industries range from chemical synthesis through polymerization. This includes high-pressure processes for
the production of industrial chemicals and low-pressure multi-product processes for the production of specialty and fine chemicals. We have extensive knowledge of, and experience with, advanced polymerization reactions and state-of-the-art,
post-reactor processing techniques.

Another important aspect of our
service to our clients in the chemicals and polymers business is in the area of field services. We have contracts with major chemical producers worldwide to provide construction, on-site maintenance, and turnaround activities. Many of these
contracts are evergreen in nature, with relationships extending over many years due to our focus on safety, value, and client satisfaction. Like the refining industry, we provide maintenance services to our clients in the chemicals industry. We have
also established formal alliances with a number of clients in this industry.

Our clients in this sector focus on safety, reliability, and maintainability to keep operating costs down. To support this initiative, we apply best practices on capital and maintenance work by leveraging synergy and resources within our
alliances and partnerships, which in some cases involve more than 25 chemical facilities for one owner.

As these multi-site relationships increase in magnitude, the range of services we provide broadens. Other services vary from providing on-site engineering services
to completing an entire capital improvement program. We provide technical consulting, project finance structuring, facility appraisal, market analysis, and business consulting services as well as fully-integrated engineering, procurement,
construction, and construction management services. Our services can guide and assist our chemical clients from a good project idea to a constructed and operating chemical facility.

Many of our clients currently engage in front-end feasibility planning as global industry volumes and prices strengthen. In addition
to large ‘mega-capacity’ projects underway in the Middle East and Asia, we are seeing incremental capacity expansions in North America and Europe. Our involvement in

Page 11


these early studies positions us to help owners capitalize on return on investment opportunities by streamlining work processes and optimizing existing plant layouts
for future expansions.

Technology and Manufacturing

We provide a broad range of project services for a variety of technology, manufacturing, and test facilities. This category includes projects involving highly
complex test facilities for clients in the aerospace and automotive industries. Typical projects range from conceptual design and feasibility studies to complete design-build programs of wind tunnels and engine test facilities, propulsion and
certification test facilities, power-train and other automotive component parts test facilities, environmental and emissions test facilities, climatic test facilities, and computer-based measurement and control systems. We are a leader in providing
support to automotive manufacturers and component suppliers for the supply of testing services and the management of test assets, with test facility operations and maintenance contracts and usage agreements in place with Ford Motor Company, Visteon,
and General Motors.

This category also includes projects for clients
operating in the semiconductor industry. We provide design, engineering, procurement, construction, and construction management services for a variety of clients in this industry. Typical projects range from on-site plant engineering and tool
hook-ups to multi-million dollar state-of-the-art wafer fabrication and crystal growing facilities used to produce microprocessors for computers and other consumer electronic devices. Projects in the semiconductor industry are more complex than many
other commercial facilities, requiring a greater emphasis on cleanroom and similar high-end technologies.

Buildings

Buildings generally refers to our full range of design and construction activities relating to
institutional, government, and corporate buildings as well as other specialized facilities, including projects at many of the world’s leading medical and research centers and universities. We are one of the leading providers of architectural,
engineering, and construction management services for buildings projects throughout the United States and in many parts of Europe.

We focus our efforts and resources in markets where strong demographic trends and capital spending initiatives drive demand. Typical projects include large,
multi-year United States federal and European governments building programs; major primary and secondary education capital improvement programs; federal, state, and local government courts and correctional facilities; hospitals and health and
research facilities (including projects at many of the world’s leading medical and research centers); and aviation facilities at many of the United States’ largest airports. We also provide design and construction-related services for
office and corporate headquarter buildings, municipal and civic facilities, commercial centers, leisure parks, and recreation complexes. We serve a diversified client base encompassing both public and private sector clients.

We provide and/or manage a full range of planning, architectural, engineering,
construction, construction management, and/or total program management services for a variety of unique and technically complex buildings and campuses. We provide our services on projects that emphasize new construction as well as those involving
expansion, renovation, and refurbishment of existing facilities.

Of
particular significance is our growing success in applying our diversified, in-house technical skill base to both public and private sector clients requiring complete program management. Such contracts typically involve providing technical,
professional, and construction services over multiple years to clients with whom we have long-standing relationships and a tenure of successful service. We also provide “resourcing” services for which we (often through joint ventures with
third parties) assume full responsibility for the ongoing operations and maintenance of entire commercial or industrial complexes on behalf of the client.

Infrastructure

We
provide a broad range of planning, design, consulting, engineering, and construction management services to our clients engaged in civil construction projects throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Asia, and other selected
countries. We significantly enhanced our infrastructure capabilities and breadth with our acquisition of The Babtie Group.

Transportation infrastructure development and rehabilitation is a core competency of our infrastructure business. By integrating a broad range of professional
disciplines, we provide comprehensive planning, engineering, and construction and program management services for transportation facilities and systems. Interdisciplinary teams work independently or as an extension of agency staff on highway,
bridge, transit, tunnel, airport, railroad, intermodal facility, maritime, and lock and dam projects. Representative clients include state departments of transportation and district and other local agencies, the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, branches of the United States military, and private industry freight transport firms.

Our services in the area of water resources have helped public and private sector clients develop and rehabilitate critical water resource systems. Integrating
water, wastewater, air quality, and hazardous waste remediation experience provides these clients with the comprehensive expertise needed to deliver complex projects. We provide planning, design, design-build, and program and construction management
services to a diverse market, including regional wastewater treatment agencies, manufacturers and power generators, local water suppliers, and military agencies. We continue to develop water/wastewater conveyance systems and water resources
management projects as specialty markets. We have developed micro-tunneling (“trenchless technology”) as a primary service and have successfully applied this specialized process to such projects as water distribution systems and pipelines.

We believe strong opportunities for planning, design, and construction
inspection will remain prominent among the types of services we perform. We also believe that opportunities for construction management and design-build services will continue to grow as these project delivery methods gain acceptance in the public
sector.

Current projects and programs we are performing include program
management services for the public utilities commissions of several major U.S. cities; construction management and asset management services for water treatment plants located in the United States and United Kingdom; design, engineering, and
construction management services for various bridge projects in the United States and overseas; and multi-year general design and consulting services for a railway entity in the United Kingdom.

Pulp and Paper

We provide a broad range of consulting, engineering, procurement, construction, construction management, and maintenance services to our clients in the pulp and
paper industry, both in the United States and internationally. With a strategy of expanding our geographic presence into areas where our clients intend to build facilities, our pulp and paper capability now extends through our offices in the United
Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy, and Mexico. Typical projects for our clients in this industry range from small mill projects to complex, multi-million dollar paper machine rebuilds, mill expansions, and the construction of new facilities.

Pulp and paper projects encompass many areas of a mill, including pulping and
bleaching, papermaking, chemical recovery, material handling, effluent treatment, and power and steam generation. In the area of papermaking, our expertise includes tissue and towel, coated and uncoated fine papers, newsprint, and linerboard. Our
expertise and skill set also include the converting and packaging of paper products for distribution and consumer use. We have been instrumental in the design and installation of state-of-the-art facilities for recycled fiber, deinking, and pulp
bleaching.

Page 13


Chemical recovery and power generation are also integral components of the papermaking process. We have broad experience in these areas and apply our expertise in the
engineering and construction of such facilities for many of our clients.

A significant portion of our work relates to assisting our clients in their compliance with environmental regulations and standards that affect the pulp and paper industry. We monitor all of the key environmental regulations affecting our
clients and offer services including compliance studies, permitting support, and design of pollution control systems. We also provide complete permitting services in support of all of our projects, including associated air modeling. In addition, we
provide compliance services regarding air pollutant standards and hazardous air pollutant emission limits from industrial boilers for many of our clients.

The escalation of energy costs is creating a renewed interest in our energy audit capabilities. This service allows our clients to improve their competitive
position by reducing energy costs, which are a major component in the cost of pulp, paper, and tissue products. Clients implementing our cost savings recommendations benefit from reduced energy costs, improved operational efficiency, and a more
effective deployment of their capital.

Like certain other markets, we
have established formal alliances with various clients in the pulp and paper industry. Such alliances allow us to expand the types of services we provide our clients and enable us to improve the overall quality, consistency, and value of our
services under the highest of expectations for confidentiality.

Other

Included in this category are projects for clients in other industry and market categories. This includes projects for clients operating in the
food and consumer products industries as well as basic resources (such as mining, minerals and fertilizers).

Backlog

For information regarding our backlog, refer to Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.

Significant Customers

For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, and 2000, revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the United
States federal government accounted for 22.3%, 22.6%, 21.5%, 19.0%, and 20.0% respectively, of total revenues.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

For financial information regarding geographic areas in which we
operate, please refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (listed in Item 15, below).

Contracts

While there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake, our
contracts generally fall into three broad categories: cost-reimbursable, fixed-price, and guaranteed maximum price. The following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts during each of the five
preceding fiscal years ended September 30:






Cost-reimbursable


%

Fixed-price






Guaranteed maximum price






Page 14


In accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the
client. Contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination.

When we are directly responsible for engineering, design, procurement, and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility, we
reflect the costs of materials, equipment, and subcontracts in both revenues and costs. On other projects, where the client elects to pay for such items directly, and we have no associated responsibility for such items, these amounts are not
reflected in either revenues or costs. The following table presents the approximate amount of such pass-through costs included in revenues for each of the five preceding fiscal years ended September 30 (in millions):






$1,165.7

$

1,389.3

$

1,541.7

$

1,272.9

1,442.1

Cost-Reimbursable Contracts

Cost-reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit. The profit element may be in the form
of a simple mark-up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee, or a combination of a mark-up and a fee. The fee element can also take several forms. The fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract; it may be an
amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred; or it may be an incentive fee based on targets, milestones, or performance factors defined in the contract. In general, we prefer cost-reimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason
for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price.

Fixed-Price Contracts

Fixed-price contracts include both
“negotiated fixed-price” contracts and “lump sum bid” contracts. Under a negotiated fixed-price contract, we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client. Negotiated fixed-price contracts
frequently exist in single-responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project. Under lump sum bid contracts, we are required to bid against other contractors based on
specifications the client furnishes. This type of pricing presents certain inherent risks that are reduced by the negotiation process, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies, and
economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Thus, although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client, the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us. However, because of economies that
may be realized during the contract term, both negotiated fixed-price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than the other types of contracts. Over the past five years, most of our fixed-price work has been either negotiated
fixed-price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services (rather than turn key construction).

Guaranteed Maximum Price Contracts

Guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as
cost-reimbursable contracts; however, the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client. If the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price, then we will bear at least some,
if not all, of the excess. In those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price, we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client. These contracts are not our preferred form of contract
because they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients, which is contrary to our relationship-based business model.

Page 15


Competition

We
engage in a highly competitive business. Some of our competitors are larger than we are or are subsidiaries of larger companies, and therefore may possess greater resources than we do. Furthermore, because the technical professional aspects of our
business do not usually require large amounts of capital, there is relative ease of market entry for a new entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications. Accordingly, we compete with regional, national, and international firms. Within
any specific geographic area, certain competitors, including regional competitors, may possess greater resources than we do.

The extent of our competition varies according to the industries and markets we serve as well as the geographic areas in which we operate. Our largest competitors
for engineering, construction, and maintenance services for process plants include the Bechtel Group, Inc., Fluor Corporation, Foster Wheeler Corp., Washington Group International, Kellogg Brown & Root, Aker Kvaerner, Technip, and AMEC plc. In
the area of buildings, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as HDR, Inc., Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, AeCOM Technology, Turner Construction, and Day & Zimmermann. In the area of infrastructure, our
competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as Parsons Brinckerhoff, URS Corporation, HNTB, and W.S. Atkins. In the area of pulp and paper, our principal competitors also include BE&K. And in the area of federal
programs, our principal competitors include several of the companies listed above as well as the Shaw Group, Montgomery Watson, SAIC, CH2M Hill, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Corporation, and Computer Sciences Corporation.

Employees

At September 30, 2004, we had approximately 24,400 full-time, staff employees (including contract staff). Additionally, as of September 30, 2004, there were approximately 11,000 persons employed in the field on a project basis.
The number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time.

Available Information

We regularly file various reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These reports include annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. We also file from time to time current reports on Form 8-K. The public may read and copy any materials we
file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20549. In order obtain information about the operation of the Public Reference Room, a person may call the SEC at 1-800-732-0330. The SEC
also maintains a site on the Internet that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC The SEC’s website is http://www.sec.gov. You may also read and download
the various reports we file with the SEC from our website, http://www.jacobs.com.

Item 2.    PROPERTIES

We own and lease offices in the locations set forth below, which are used by our technical professional and administrative staff. Our Charleston, South Carolina facilities are also the principal manufacturing and fabrication site for our
modular construction activities. The total amount of space used by us for all of our operations is approximately 4.4 million square feet. The following is a representative list of our principal locations:

[ continued ]

Page 16


Item 2.    PROPERTIES—Continued

Page 17


In addition to these properties, we lease smaller, project offices located throughout the United States, the United
Kingdom, and in certain other countries. We maintain sales offices at many of our principal locations. The majority of our offices and locations are leased. We also rent a portion of our construction equipment on a short-term basis.

Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees, litigation and investigations. Generally, such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance. Most of the litigation involves us as a
defendant in workers’ compensation, personal injury, environmental, environmental exposure, professional liability, and other similar lawsuits. In addition, as a contractor for many agencies of the United States government, we are subject to
many levels of audits, investigations and claims by, or on behalf of, the government with respect to contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations and procurement practices.

Management believes, after consultation with counsel, that such guarantees, litigation, United States government contract-related
audits, investigations and claims should not have any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In addition to the matters described above, we are involved in a dispute with a client relating to a large waste incineration project in Europe. The contract was
entered into by one of our subsidiaries several years ago, prior to the acquisition of that subsidiary. The dispute involves proper waste feed, content of residues, final acceptance of the plant, and costs of operation and maintenance of the plant.
We have initiated litigation against the client and are seeking in excess of

€

40.0 million (approximately $49.7 million) in damages.
The client has filed a counterclaim against us, which we believe is without merit. We believe our claims are valid and enforceable and that we will be ultimately successful in obtaining a favorable judgment.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), and
trades under the symbol “JEC”. According to the records of our transfer agent, there were 1,118 stockholders of record as of December 10, 2004. The following table sets forth the low and high sales price of our common stock, during each of
the fiscal quarters presented, based on the NYSE consolidated transaction report:

Our policy is to use earnings to
fund future growth, pay down debt, and repurchase common stock under a stock buy-back program approved by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, we have not paid a cash dividend since fiscal 1984. Although our Board of Directors periodically reviews
the merits of paying cash dividends, we currently have no plans to pay cash dividends in the near future.

The following table presents certain information about our equity compensation plans as of September 30, 2004:

Note (1):

The number in Column A excludes purchase rights accruing under our two, broad-based, shareholder-approved employee stock purchase plans: the Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. 1989 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the “1989 ESPP”), and the Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “GESPP”). These plans give employees the right to purchase shares at an amount and price that are not determinable until the end of the specified
purchase periods, which occur at semi-annual intervals each year. Our shareholders have authorized a total of 11.4 million shares of common stock to be issued through the 1989 ESPP and the GESPP, which our Board of Directors voluntarily reduced by
0.6 million shares on July 26, 2001. From the inception of the 1989 ESPP and the GESPP through September 30, 2004, 8.9 million shares have been issued, leaving 1.9 million shares of common stock available for future issuance at that date.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The purpose of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is to provide an overview of the Company’s
financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next.

In this discussion, we may make statements that are not based on historical fact. All such statements are “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although such statements are based on management’s current estimates and expectations, and currently available
competitive, financial, and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and we caution the reader that a variety of factors could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from what is contained in our
forward-looking statements. A list of some of the factors most likely to occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements is presented at the end of this MD&A.

In this MD&A, we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows:

Overview

Our operating results for fiscal 2004 reflected growth in earnings that was below management’s expectations. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we had
several projects where our work was either suspended or delayed, and one project that was cancelled entirely. Although changes in the timing of when work required by large projects commences is not unusual, the magnitude of the delays and
cancellation that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 had a significant impact on our results of operations for both the third and fourth fiscal quarters. These delays and cancellations contributed to a decline in revenues, and hindered
our ability to absorb the increase in our SG&A expenses. Also contributing to the decrease in revenues during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was a decline in pass-through costs. When we are responsible for subcontract labor or
third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs. Since pass-through costs (which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services) typically do not have

Page 21


significant margins, we can experience a decline in revenues without experiencing a corresponding decline in our gross margins and operating profit.

The increase in the technical and professional services component of our revenues,
relative to pass-through costs, was the chief reason for the improved gross margins for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. Gross margins increased by $38.8 million, or 6.2%, during fiscal 2004 as compared to last year. However, due to increased
G&A spending in support of higher home-office services, our operating profit percentage remained at 4.3% of revenues for fiscal 2004; the same percentage as fiscal 2003.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we completed the acquisition of the Babtie Group for a total cash purchase price of
£92.0 million (approximately $169.3 million). Headquartered in Scotland, the Babtie Group is a leading provider of technical and professional services to clients in the infrastructure, facilities, environmental, defense, and governmental
outsourcing markets, among others. Although the Babtie Group employs approximately 3,500 people and generates approximately $300.0 million of revenues annually, the effect of the acquisition on our fiscal 2004 results of operations was not material.

Because (i) the entire value of contracts is added to backlog as soon as
the contracts are awarded to us (rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time), and (ii) many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years), we
evaluate our backlog on a year-over-year basis, rather than on a sequential, quarter-over-quarter basis. Our backlog at September 30, 2004 increased by $411.5 million, or 5.8%, to $7.5 billion from $7.0 billion at September 30, 2003. The increase in
backlog during fiscal 2004 was attributable primarily to the addition of the Babtie Group, combined with new awards from clients within the oil & gas and refining industries, and the U.S. federal program area of our business. Backlog at
September 30, 2004 reflects the project cancellation discussed above. In addition, approximately $150.0 million of procurement backlog was removed during the third quarter of fiscal 2004, as well as approximately $160.0 million of backlog relating
to public sector work when it was determined that we would not receive the full value of the contract award.

Our cash balances remained strong during fiscal 2004. In spite of the cash used to acquire the Babtie Group and an increase in acquisitions of property and
equipment, cash and cash equivalents totaled $100.1 million at September 30, 2004 compared to $126.2 million at September 30, 2003. Our cash balances, combined with a borrowing capacity of $290.0 million under our long-term, unsecured revolving
credit facility, present sufficient capital resources for us to fund our on-going operations.

Additions to property and equipment totaled $37.1 million during fiscal 2004. This was $11.3 million, or 43.8%, higher than the amount spent during fiscal 2003. Contributing to the increase was certain initiatives to expand
office space in several of our larger offices in the United States and United Kingdom.

Critical Accounting Policies

In order to better understand changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition
and operating results, a reader of this MD&A should understand the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements.

The Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and the financial statements of any business entity performing long-term engineering and construction-type contracts, requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect both the
entity’s results of operations as well as the carrying values of its assets and liabilities. Although our significant accounting polices are described in Note 2 of the Notes to

Page 22


Consolidated Financial Statements, the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.

Revenue Accounting for Contracts and Use of
Joint Ventures

—In accounting for long-term engineering and construction-type contracts, we follow the provisions of the AICPA’s Statement of Position 81-1—

Accounting for Performance of

Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts

. In general, we recognize revenues at the time we provide services. Depending on the commercial terms of the contract, we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred, or using the percentage-of-completion method
of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion. This method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments
are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule, the cost of materials and labor, and productivity; and the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, and achievement of contractual performance
standards. Many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. In some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee
arrangements. In certain instances, we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates, target costs, and/or other performance criteria. Failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized
incentive fees or non-recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues recognized from the project. One such contract is with the U.S. Department of Energy for the Fernald Closure Project. This contract provides for incentive fees based on schedule
and cost. In addition, the terms of the contract stipulate that the incentive fees may not be fully billed to the DOE until the completion of the project, currently estimated to occur in 2007. At September 30, 2004 we had recognized $25.8 million of
deferred fees relating to this contract.

We provide for contract losses
in their entirety in the period they become known, without regard to the percentage of completion.

The nature of our business results in clients, subcontractors or vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of
what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible. Similarly, and in the normal course of business, we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not
contractually responsible. In those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract, we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract (and therefore, the estimated amount of margin to be earned under
the contract) an estimate, based on the relevant facts and circumstances available, of the additional costs to be incurred. In those situations where we have incurred additional costs for which we believe the client is contractually responsible, we
may present a claim to the client for such costs. In such situations, we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred, without profit, to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue, and the amount of
such additional revenue can be reliably estimated. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims.

Certain cost-reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are
subject to audit and adjustment. In this situation, revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts. In those situations where an audit indicates that we may have
billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract, we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly.

As is common in the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures. For certain of these joint
ventures (i.e., where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture), we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture

Page 23


revenues, costs and operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures, we use the
equity method of accounting.

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

—We account for stock-based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method, in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25—

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

. Accordingly, on the date a stock option is granted to
an employee, we measure compensation cost based on the excess, if any, of the market price of the Company’s common stock over the exercise price of the awarded option.

In accordance with current accounting standards, we compute a pro forma expense amount for stock options issued, and we disclose this
pro forma expense amount in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to compute the pro forma expense amount. The Black-Scholes model, however, was developed for use in estimating the value of
publicly-traded options that have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the use of assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical, fair value of an option. Changes in these
assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option. Accordingly, we caution the readers of our consolidated financial statements that the results of applying the Black-Scholes model are not necessarily a reliable
measure of the true fair value of stock options granted to employees.

Accounting for Pension Plans

—In accounting for pension plans, we follow the provisions of SFAS No. 87—

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.

SFAS 87 requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to
calculate periodic pension cost, and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities. These assumptions involve discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in
valuing the financial position of the plans, and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used. During fiscal 2004, we lowered slightly our expected rate of return on plan assets from a range of 8.0% to 9.0% in fiscal 2003 to a range of
6.0% to 9.0% in fiscal 2004. We believe this reduction better reflects the long-term returns expected on the plans’ assets, considering projected rates of inflation, the diversification of the plans’ assets, and the expected real rates of
market returns. Changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans’ assets and liabilities, and the associated pension expense. Management, together with our actuaries, monitors trends in the marketplace within which
our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used.

In connection with the fiscal 2001 acquisition of certain engineering and contracting businesses from Stork N.V., we are negotiating the value of certain plan assets and prior service obligations that may be transferred from a
multiemployer pension plan into a new, single-employer pension plan we formed during fiscal 2004 for the benefit of our employees in the Netherlands. If such a transfer were to occur presently, we believe the value of the assets we would receive
would be less than the value of the prior service pension obligations we would assume. Included in “Other Deferred Liabilities” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2004 is approximately $42.3 million for the
prior service obligations relating to the multiemployer pension plan in the Netherlands.

Accounting for Income Taxes

—We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109—

Accounting for Income Taxes

. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the
normal course of our business, we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain.
Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions. Our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the United States, and by various
government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the United States. Although our effective tax rate has been 35% during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we continually monitor the

Page 24


appropriateness of the rate, and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates.

Insurance Matters, Litigation, Claims, and Contingencies

—In the normal
course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. Generally, such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance. Most of the litigation in which we are concerned involves the Company as a defendant
in workers’ compensation, personal injury, environmental, environmental exposure, professional liability, and other similar lawsuits. We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. However, we have elected to
retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs. This situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely
uninsured. In addition, as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the United States federal government, we are subject to many levels of audits, investigations, and claims by, or on behalf of, the U.S. federal government with respect
to contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations, and procurement practices.

In accordance with SFAS No. 5—

Accounting for Contingencies

, we record in our Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims, guarantees, litigation, and audits and
investigations. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for both insurance-related claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurance-related claims that are
believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis, but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates. We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of
operations.

Testing Goodwill for Impairment

—In accordance
with SFAS No. 142

—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”), the amount of goodwill carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is tested annually for possible impairment. In conducting the impairment test, we may apply,
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, various techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These techniques are inherently subjective and the resulting values are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain
in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party. Since the adoption of SFAS 142 in fiscal 2002, we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill.

Operations Outside the United States

—In general, our principal exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the
effects of translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. We follow the provisions of SFAS No. 52—

Foreign Currency Translation

in
preparing our consolidated financial statements.

We believe our exposure
to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations primarily in their respective local functional
currencies. In situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies, we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs.

Results of Operations

General

Our business
focuses exclusively on providing technical, professional, and construction services to a large number of industrial, commercial, and governmental clients around the world. The services we provide generally fall into four broad categories:

•

project services (which includes engineering, design, architectural, and similar services);

Page 25


•

construction services (which includes revenues earned from traditional field construction activities as well as modular construction activities);

•

operations and maintenance (“O&M”) services (which includes revenues from contracts requiring us to operate and maintain large, complex facilities on behalf of clients as well
as contracts involving process plant maintenance services and activities);

•

and process, scientific, and systems consulting services (which includes revenues earned from providing a wide variety of scientific and consulting services to clients).

The scope of services we can provide our clients,
therefore, ranges from consulting and conceptual design services (which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project) to complete, single-responsibility, design-build-operate contracts.

The following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended
September 30 (in thousands):

Beginning with the second
quarter of fiscal 2002, we classify certain elements of revenues as Construction that were classified previously as Project Services. In Addition, certain amounts for fiscal 2002 and 2003 have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2004
presentation.

We focus our services on certain industry groups and
markets that we believe have sufficient common needs to permit cross-utilization of our resources. The following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended September 30 (in thousands):

“Other” includes
projects for clients operating in a number of industries including food and consumer products, and basic resources (such as mining, minerals, and fertilizers).

Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003

We recorded
net earnings of $129.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, for fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, compared to net earnings of $128.0 million, or $2.27 per diluted share for fiscal 2003.

Page 26


Total revenues for fiscal 2004 remained relatively unchanged from fiscal 2003 at $4.6 billion. The amount of
pass-through costs included in revenues in fiscal 2004 declined by approximately $223.6 million, or 16.1%, as compared to fiscal 2003. The level of pass-through costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending
principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal winding down of field services activities on construction and O&M projects. See Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of pass-through costs. Off-setting this decline in field services activity in part was approximately $54.0 million of revenues of the Babtie Group, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004. The Babtie Group is a leading provider of technical and professional services to clients in the infrastructure, facilities, environmental, defense, and governmental outsourcing markets, among others.

As a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were 85.5% for fiscal 2004
compared to 86.4% for fiscal 2003. The percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being
compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided. In general, the percentage improvement in this performance indicator from fiscal 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to a higher portion of our total revenues
being derived from technical professional services versus field services.

SG&A expenses for fiscal 2004 increased by $37.6 million, or 8.8%, to $466.4 million, compared to $428.8 million for fiscal 2003. Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2004 is approximately $13.5 million of SG&A expenses from the
Babtie Group. The balance of the increase was due primarily to the effects of foreign currency translation, and higher spending in support of our professional technical services activities.

Operating profit for fiscal 2004 totaled $198.3 million; relatively unchanged from the
fiscal 2003 amount of $197.1 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating profit was 4.3% for both fiscal 2004 and 2003.

Interest income increased by $1.7 million to $3.1 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $1.4 million for fiscal 2003. The increase in interest income was due
primarily to higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. Interest expense increased by $0.3 million, or 9.6%, to $3.6 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $3.3 million for fiscal 2003. The increase in interest
expense was due primarily to slightly higher borrowings under our long-term, revolving credit facility.

We recorded income tax expense of $69.4 million and $68.9 million for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our overall effective tax rate was 35.0% for both fiscal
years. In the normal course of our business, we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense)
is uncertain. Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions. Our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the United States, and by
various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the United States. Although our effective tax rate has been 35% for fiscal 2004 and 2003, we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate, and we adjust our income tax
expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002

We recorded net earnings of $128.0 million, or $2.27 per diluted share for
fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, compared to net earnings of $109.7 million, or $1.98 per diluted share for fiscal 2002.

Page 27


Total revenues for fiscal 2003 increased by $59.9 million, or 1.3%, to $4.6 billion compared to fiscal 2002. Our
revenues were relatively flat during the current fiscal year primarily attributable to a $152.4 million, or 9.9% decline in pass-through costs. The amount of pass-through costs included in revenues during fiscal 2003 totaled $1.4 billion compared to
$1.5 billion during fiscal 2002.

As a percentage of revenues, direct
costs of contracts were 86.4% for fiscal 2003 compared to 87.2% for fiscal 2002. The percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix
of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided.

SG&A expenses for fiscal 2003 increased by $17.5 million, or 4.2%, to $428.8 million, compared to $411.3 million for fiscal 2002. The increase in SG&A
expenses included the impact of the operations of McDermott Engineers & Constructors (Canada) Limited (including Delta Catalytic and Delta Hudson Engineering; collectively “Delta”) for a full twelve months in the current fiscal year
compared to only eleven months in fiscal 2002, since we completed the acquisition of Delta on October 31, 2001. Had Delta’s operations been included for a full twelve months for fiscal 2002, SG&A expenses would have been higher by an
additional $0.9 million. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated SG&A expenses increased to 9.3% in fiscal 2003 compared to 9.0% in fiscal 2002. Management continues efforts to tighten controls over discretionary spending.

Despite a relatively flat revenue stream during fiscal 2003, our operating profit
increased by $24.7 million, or 14.4%, to $197.1 million, compared to $172.4 million during fiscal 2002. As a percentage of revenues, operating profit increased to 4.3% in fiscal 2003, compared to 3.8% in fiscal 2002. The increase in our operating
profit was due primarily to improved margins.

Interest expense decreased
by $4.2 million, or 56.6%, to $3.3 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $7.5 million in fiscal 2002 due to significantly reduced borrowing levels. In August 2003 we entered into a new, five year $290.0 million unsecured revolving bank credit
agreement and terminated the existing revolving credit facilities that had an aggregate borrowing capacity of $275.0 million. The previous facilities that were replaced were scheduled to expire in January 2004. Amounts outstanding under our
revolving credit facilities totaled $17.8 million bearing interest of 2.9% at September 30, 2003, compared to $85.7 million bearing interest of 3.8% at September 30, 2002. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on our borrowings.

We recorded income tax expense of $68.9
million and $59.1 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our overall effective tax rate was 35.0% for both fiscal 2003 and 2002.

Contractual Obligations

The following table sets forth certain
information about our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2004 (in thousands):

Page 28


(a)

Assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal 2005, allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases, but
limited to the amount recorded as of September 30, 2004. Actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors, including amounts required by local laws and regulations, and other funding requirements.

(b)

Assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal 2004, allowing for certain growth. Due to the nonqualified nature of the plans, and the fact that benefits are
based in part on years of service, the payments included in the schedule was limited to the amount recorded as of September 30, 2004.

(c)

Represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of September 30, 2004.

Backlog

The following table summarizes our total backlog at September 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in millions):

In accordance with industry
practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client. However, we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts. In a situation where
a client terminates a contract, we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and, in certain instances, we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs. While management uses
all information available to it to determine backlog, our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein.

In fiscal 2002 we began classifying as “field services” backlog certain
engineering and scientific and systems consulting activities relating to operations and maintenance contracts that had been classified previously as “technical professional services” backlog. Backlog for fiscal years 2001 has been
reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2002 presentation.

Total backlog
at September 30, 2004 included approximately $2.3 billion (or 30.2%) of total backlog, relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the U.S. federal government and its agencies. This compares to approximately $1.9 billion (or
27.7%) and $1.8 billion (or 27.6%) of U.S. federal backlog at September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Most of our federal contracts extend beyond one year. In general, these contracts must be funded annually (i.e., the amounts to be spent under
the contract must be appropriated by the U.S. Congress to the procuring agency, and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts).

Our backlog for fiscal 2004 increased by $411.5 million, or 5.8%, to $7.5 billion, compared to fiscal 2003, and increased in fiscal 2003 by $366.8 million, or 5.5%,
to $7.0 billion, compared to fiscal 2002. The increase in backlog during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable primarily to the addition of the Babtie Group, combined with new awards from clients within the oil & gas and
refining industries; and the U.S. federal program area of our business. The increase in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable primarily to new awards from clients in the oil & gas and refining industries combined with new U.S.
federal program awards.

Page 29


We estimate that approximately $3.7 billion or 49.2% of total backlog at September 30, 2004 will be realized as
revenues within the next fiscal year.

Effects of Inflation

During fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, approximately 83%, 82%, and 85%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues were realized from cost-reimbursable type contracts.
Because a significant portion of our revenues continues to be earned under cost-reimbursable type contracts, the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations continue to be generally low. However, as we expand our
business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. To the extent permitted by competition, we intend to continue to
emphasize contracts which are either cost-reimbursable or negotiated fixed-price. For contracts with fixed-price and lump-sum terms, we closely monitor the actual costs on the project as compared to the original estimates. On these projects, we also
attempt to secure fixed-price commitments from key subcontractors and vendors. However, due to the competitive nature of our business, combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel, equipment and materials we
traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts, there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our results of operations in the future.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We finance our operations
primarily through cash provided by operations. At September 30, 2004, our principal source of liquidity consisted of $100.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $211.2 million of available capacity under our $290.0 million revolving credit
facility discussed below.

During fiscal 2004, our cash and cash
equivalents decreased by $26.1 million, to $100.1 million. This compares to a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $77.7 million, to $126.2 million, during fiscal 2003, and to a net decrease of $0.8 million, to $48.5 million, during fiscal
2002. During fiscal 2004, we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities, and financing activities of $87.8 million and $91.4 million, respectively. These inflows were offset by net cash outflows from investing activities and the effect
of exchange rate changes of $203.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively.

Our operations provided net cash of $87.8 million during fiscal 2004. This compares to net cash inflows of $147.5 million and $160.8 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $59.8 million decrease in cash provided by
operations in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to a decrease of $38.1 million relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts. Also contributing to the decline in cash flows from
operations was the effects of a $14.0 million change in deferred income taxes, and a $7.5 million increase in gains from the sales of assets (the cash flows associated with which are shown in the investing section of the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows).

The net cash we used for investing activities was $203.1
million during fiscal 2004. This compares to net cash outflows of $17.7 million and $92.5 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. The net increase of $185.4 million in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2004 as compared to
fiscal 2003 was due primarily to an increase of $163.8 million in cash used for acquisitions. Also contributing to the increase in cash used for investing activities was a $11.3 million increase in additions to property and equipment; a $10.7
million increase in investments and other non-current assets; and a $4.1 decrease in cash proceeds from the sales of investments. Off-setting these increases in part was a $4.5 million increase in proceeds from sales of property and equipment.

Our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of $91.4 million
during fiscal 2004. This compares to net cash outflows of $55.0 million and $64.7 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $146.3 million increase in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2004 as

Page 30


compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to a $54.7 million increase in borrowings, net of repayments, under our long-term credit facilities, combined with a $77.4
million reduction during fiscal 2004 of cash used to pay-off short-term indebtedness.

We believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future. We had $100.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2004, compared to $126.2
million at September 30, 2003. Our consolidated working capital position at September 30, 2004 was $397.6 million, compared to $358.7 million at September 30, 2003. We have a long-term, unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to $290.0
million of debt capacity, under which only $78.0 million was utilized at September 30, 2004 in the form of direct borrowings. We believe that the capacity, terms and conditions of our long-term revolving credit facility is adequate for our working
capital and general business requirements, as well as the working capital needs associated with the acquisition of the Babtie Group. We also had, at September 30, 2004, $38.6 million of borrowing capacity available to us through committed,
short-term credit facilities.

Under our stock repurchase program, we are
authorized by our Board of Directors to buy-back up to 6.0 million shares of the common stock of the Company in the open market. Repurchases of common stock are financed from existing credit facilities and available cash balances. From inception of
the program through September 30, 2004, we have repurchased a total of 3,732,400 shares of common stock in the open market at a total cost of $59.0 million. No shares of common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2004 and 2003. Substantially all
shares of common stock held in treasury were eventually reissued for our employee stock purchase and incentive stock plans.

Factors That May Affect Forward-Looking Statements

As mentioned
above, there are a variety of factors that could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this MD&A, including, in no particular order, the following:

•

Increase in competition by United States and international competitors;

•

Changes in global business, economic, political, and social condition;

•

Availability of qualified engineers, architects, designers and other home-office staff needed to execute contracts;

•

Availability of qualified craft personnel in the geographic areas where our construction and maintenance sites are located;

•

The timing of new awards and the funding of such awards;

•

Delays, cancellations, or suspensions of, or changes in the scope to, existing contracts;

•

Our ability to meet performance or schedule guarantees;

•

Cost overruns on fixed-price, guaranteed maximum price, or unit priced contracts;

•

The possible effects of inflation on margins available on fixed-price contracts;

•

The effects that fluctuating exchange rates may have on the U.S. dollar results of our international operations;

Page 31


•

The outcome of pending and future claims, litigation, and any government audits, investigations or proceedings;

•

The cyclical nature of the individual markets in which our clients operate;

•

Delays or defaults by clients in making payments due under contracts;

•

The successful integration of recent and future acquisitions;

•

The effect on future earnings due to any change in the way stock options are required to be accounted for.

The preceding list is not all-inclusive, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as
a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis should also read our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of our business, legal proceedings and other
information that describes factors that could cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements.

Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the Company to market risk. In the normal course
of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates.

Interest Rate Risk

Our only source for long-term
credit is a $290.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility. The total amount outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2004 was $78.8 million. This agreement expires in August of 2008, and provides for both fixed-rate and variable-rate
borrowings. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain fixed rate debt on a
majority of our borrowings and minimize our outstanding borrowings by paying down debt from cash provided from operations.

Foreign Currency Risk

In general, our exposure to
fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the United States, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. We follow the
provisions of SFAS No. 52—

Foreign Currency Translation

in preparing our consolidated financial statements.

We believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because, in general, our
various operations invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective local currencies. In situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies, we strive to have a
portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs.

In connection with the acquisition of the Babtie Group, we entered into a forward contract with a large, U.S. bank in the notional amount of £39.9 million (approximately $73.4 million). The purpose of the contract was to
hedge the Company’s foreign currency exchange exposure on a £39.9 million intercompany loan between Jacobs and one of its subsidiaries. Regardless of the degree to which the value of British Sterling may decline against the U.S. Dollar,
the maximum potential effect on our future earnings will be limited to $5.0 million. The forward contract qualifies as a cash flow hedge under the provisions SFAS No. 133—

Item 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, the Company carried
out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired
control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures.

Changes in Internal Controls.

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Sarbanes-Oxley 404 Compliance.

We have begun an assessment of our internal controls as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We are currently in
the evaluation phase of the design and operational effectiveness of our controls. To assist us with this project, we have supplemented our internal project team with outside specialists. Although we have not identified any material deficiencies in
our systems of internal controls, there is a possibility that such deficiencies exist. In the event deficiencies are discovered, we will investigate them, assess what effects, if any, they may have on our systems of internal controls and, as
appropriate, remediate them.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Description of Business and Basis of Presentation

Description of Business

Our principal business is to provide a broad range of technical, professional, and
construction services. Such services include engineering, design, and architectural services; construction and construction management services; operations and maintenance services; and process, scientific, and systems consulting services. We
provide our services through offices and subsidiaries located primarily in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. We provide our services under cost-reimbursable, cost-reimbursable with a guaranteed maximum price, and fixed-price contracts. The
percentage of revenues realized from each of these types of contracts for each fiscal year ended September 30 was as follows:




Cost-reimbursable

Fixed-price




Guaranteed maximum price




Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the parent company and each of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

2.    Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Accounting for Contracts and Use of Joint Ventures

In general, we recognize revenues at the time services are
performed. On cost-reimbursable contracts, revenue is recognized as costs are incurred, and includes applicable fees earned through the date services are provided. On fixed-price contracts, revenues are recorded using the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion. This method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such
estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule, the cost of materials and labor, and productivity; and the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, and achievement of
contractual performance standards. Many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. In some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts
with incentive-fee arrangements. In certain instances, we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates, target costs, and/or other performance criteria. Failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in
unrealized incentive fees or non-recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues recognized from the project. We provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known, without regard to the percentage-of-completion. We
recognize as revenues costs associated with claims and unapproved change orders to the extent it is probable that such claims and change orders will result in additional contract revenue, and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably
estimated.

Some of our contracts with government customers as well as
certain contracts with commercial clients provide that contract costs (including indirect costs) are subject to audit and adjustment. For all such contracts, revenues have been recorded at the time services were performed based upon those amounts
expected to be realized upon completion of the contracts.

F-7


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

As is common to the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of
joint ventures. In general, such contracts fall within the scope of AICPA Statement of Position 81-1—

Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts

(“SOP 81-1”). We therefore account for
these investments in accordance with SOP 81-1 and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-01—

Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display Under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures

. Accordingly,
for certain of these joint ventures (i.e., where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the joint venture), we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues, costs and operating profit in our Consolidated
Statements of Earnings. For other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures, we use the equity method of accounting.

Very few of our joint ventures have employees. Although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients, the services required by the contracts are
typically performed by us and our partners, or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures. The assets of our joint ventures, therefore, consist almost entirely of cash and receivables (representing amounts due
from the clients); and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners (for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures) and other subcontractors. In general, at any given time,
the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned under the contracts with clients. None of our joint ventures have third-party debt or credit facilities. Our joint ventures, therefore, are simply mechanisms used to
deliver engineering and construction services to clients. They do not, in and of themselves, present any risk of loss to us or to our partners. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our share of losses associated with
the contracts held by the joint ventures, if and when they occur, has always been reflected in our consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46R—

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(“FIN 46”), we have analyzed our
joint ventures and have classified them into two groups: the first group consists of those variable interest entities (“VIEs”) of which we are the primary beneficiary; the second group consists of those VIEs of which we are not the primary
beneficiary. In accordance with FIN 46, we apply the consolidation method of accounting for our investment in material VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary.

At September 30, 2004, the total assets and liabilities of those VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were $102.5 million and
$83.6 million, respectively. At September 30, 2004, the total assets and liabilities of those VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary were $23.9 million and $27.1 million, respectively.

When we are directly responsible for subcontractor labor, or third-party materials and
equipment, we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs. On other projects, where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items, these amounts are not reflected in either
revenues or costs. The amount of such “pass-through” costs included in revenues during fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 totaled $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.5 billion, respectively.

Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents at September 30, 2004 and 2003
consisted primarily of money market mutual funds.

F-8


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Investments in Marketable Securities

At any given time we may own marketable securities. Typically, we receive such securities through distributions from private venture capital funds in which we
invest. We classify our investments in marketable equity and debt securities as either trading securities, held-to-maturity securities or available-for-sale securities. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of
purchase, and we review the designations at each balance sheet date.

Trading securities are recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of trading securities are recognized in earnings in the period in which the change occurs and is included in “Miscellaneous income, net” in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Held-to-maturity securities and
available-for-sale securities are included as long-term investments in “Other Noncurrent Assets” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at cost, or amortized cost, adjusted for the
amortization (accretion) of any related premiums (discounts) over the estimated remaining period until maturity. Marketable equity securities that are not held for trading, and debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity, are
classified as available-for-sale securities. Securities designated as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of securities available-for-sale are recorded as unrealized gains or losses, net of the related tax effect
in “Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity.

Receivables and Billings in Excess of Costs

Included in “Receivables” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2004 and 2003 were $450.8 million and $398.0 million,
respectively, of unbilled receivables. Unbilled receivables represent costs and amounts earned and reimbursable under contracts in progress as of the date our balance sheet. Such amounts become billable according to the contract terms, which usually
consider the passage of time, achievement of certain milestones or completion of the project. Included in these unbilled receivables at September 30, 2004 and 2003 were contract retentions totaling $44.9 million and $26.9 million, respectively. We
anticipate that substantially all of such unbilled amounts will be billed and collected over the next twelve months.

“Billings in excess of costs” represent cash collected from clients on contracts in advance of revenues earned thereon as well as advanced billings to
clients in excess of costs and earnings on uncompleted contracts. We anticipate that substantially all such amounts will be earned over the next twelve months.

Amounts due from the U.S. federal government included in “Receivables” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $154.5 million and
$131.8 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In
accordance with industry practice, we include in receivables claims representing the recovery of costs incurred on contracts to the extent it is probable that such claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional
revenues can be reliably estimated. Such amounts totaled $38.7 million and $35.4 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, of which $32.5 million and $25.2 million, respectively, relate to one claim on a waste incineration project
performed in Europe. The dispute involves proper waste feed, content of residues, final acceptance of, and costs of operation and maintenance of the plant. We have initiated litigation against the client and are seeking

F-9


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

in excess of

€

40.0 million (approximately $49.7
million) in damages. The client has filed a counterclaim against us, which we believe is without merit.

Property, Equipment and Improvements

Property,
equipment and improvements are carried at cost, and are shown net of accumulated depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Depreciation and amortization is computed primarily by using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the related lease. Estimated useful
lives range from 20 to 40 years for buildings, from 3 to 10 years for equipment and from 4 to 10 years for leasehold improvements.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Consistent
with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 141—

Business Combinations

and 142

—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”), goodwill and the cost of intangible assets with
indefinite lives are not amortized, but are instead evaluated annually for possible impairment. In conducting the impairment test, we may apply, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, various techniques to estimate the fair value of our
reporting units. These techniques are inherently subjective and the resulting values are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party. Since the adoption of SFAS 142 in fiscal
2002, we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill

The cost of intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized ratably over the useful lives of the related assets. When events or circumstances or changes in our operations occur that could indicate that the value of our intangible
assets may be impaired, we would conduct an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of our intangible assets with determinable lives to determine whether an adjustment should be made to the carrying value of such assets or their
remaining useful lives of the assets, or both.

Earnings Per
Share

Earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
128—

Earnings per Share

. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive securities that were outstanding
during the period. Our dilutive securities consist solely of nonqualified stock options.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method, in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 25—

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”). Accordingly, on the date a stock option is granted to an employee, we measure compensation cost based on the excess, if any, of the market
price of the Company’s common stock over the exercise price of the awarded option.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 123—

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS 123”) prescribes an optional, fair-value based method of accounting for stock issued to employees and others. Had we
determined compensation cost under SFAS 123, our net earnings and earnings per

F-10


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

share for each fiscal year ended September 30 would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts (in thousands, except per share data):

The fair value of each option
was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option-pricing
model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Like all option-pricing models, the Black-Scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions
including the expected volatility of the underlying stock price. Since our stock options possess characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimates of our options. We believe that existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the stock options we grant. The effects of applying SFAS 123 for these pro forma disclosures are not likely to be
representative of the effects on reported earnings for future fiscal years as options vest over several years and additional awards are generally made each year.

With respect to the issuance of restricted stock, unearned compensation expense equivalent to the market value of the stock issued on
the date of award is charged to stockholders’ equity and subsequently amortized against earnings over the periods during which the restrictions lapse. During fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, we recognized compensation expense on restricted
stock of $0.8 million, $0.9 million, and $0.7 million, respectively.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and
financial institutions located primarily in the United States, Europe, Canada and Asia. In the normal course of our business, and consistent with industry practices, we grant credit to our clients without requiring collateral. Concentrations of
credit risk is the risk that, if we extend a significant amount of credit to clients in a specific geographic area or industry, we may experience disproportionately high

F-11


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

levels of default if those clients are adversely affected by factors particular to their geographic area or industry. Concentrations of credit risk relative to trade
receivables are limited due to our diverse client base, which includes the U.S. federal government and multi-national corporations operating in a broad range of industries and geographic areas. Additionally, in order to mitigate credit risk, we
continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our major commercial clients.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities; amounts contained in certain of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the revenues and expenses
reported for the periods covered by the financial statements. Although such assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future, actual results could differ significantly
from those estimates and assumptions.

We discussed above two significant
accounting policies that rely on the application of estimates and assumptions: revenue accounting for contracts; and the process for testing goodwill for possible impairment. The following is a discussion of certain other significant accounting
policies that rely on the use of estimates:

Accounting for Pension
Plans

—In accounting for pension plans, we follow the provisions of SFAS No. 87—

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

(“SFAS 87”) . SFAS 87 requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic
pension cost, and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities. These assumptions involve discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial
position of the plans, and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used. Changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans’ assets and liabilities, and the associated pension expense.

Accounting for Income Taxes

—We account for income taxes in accordance with
SFAS No. 109—

Accounting for Income Taxes

. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the normal course of our business, we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax
outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain. Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions. Our
tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the United States, and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the United States.

Insurance Matters, Litigation, Claims, and Contingencies

—In the normal
course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. In accordance with SFAS No. 5—

Accounting for Contingencies

, we record in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts representing our estimated liability
relating to such claims, guarantees, litigation, and audits and investigations. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for both insurance-related claims that are known and have been asserted
against us as well as for insurance-related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis, but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the balance sheet date. We include any adjustments to such
insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations.

F-12


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Certain of our assets, such as marketable equity securities (discussed above) and a forward contract we purchased as a cash-flow hedge (discussed below), are
required to be carried in our consolidated financial statements at fair value. The fair values of these assets are determined based on quoted market prices and similar market information, and were not significant at September 30, 2004 and 2003. The
net carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents; receivables; and notes payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Similarly, we believe the carrying value of our long-term debt also approximates fair value
based on the interest rates and scheduled maturities applicable to the outstanding borrowings.

Stock Split

On February 12, 2002, our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split. The stock split was
distributed on April 1, 2002 in the form of a 100% stock dividend to all stockholders of record on March 1, 2002. The stock split resulted in the issuance of 27.1 million shares of common stock. The par value of the common stock is unchanged at $1
per share and, accordingly, $27.1 million was transferred from additional paid-in capital to common stock in April 2002. The effect of the stock split has been recognized retroactively. Accordingly, all references in the Consolidated Financial
Statements to earnings or price per share, as well as all stock option plan data, have been restated to reflect the stock split.

3.    Stock Purchase and Stock Option Plans

Broad-Based, Employee Stock Purchase Plans

We
sponsor two, broad-based, shareholder-approved employee stock purchase plans: the Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “1989 ESPP”) and the Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the “GESPP”). Both plans give employees the right to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The purchase price for the stock varies by plan. Under the 1989 ESPP, the purchase price is generally the lower of (i) 90% of the
common stock’s closing market price on the first day of the option period, or (ii) 90% of the common stock’s closing market price on the last day of the option period. Under the GESPP, the purchase price varies by sub-plan (there is one
sub-plan for each foreign country where a participating subsidiary is domiciled), but may not be less than the lower of (i) 90% of the common stock’s closing market price on the first day of the option period, or (ii) 90% of the common
stock’s closing market price on the last day of the option period. Under both the 1989 ESPP and GESPP, option periods are six months in duration, running from September 1 to February 28 or 29, and from March 1 to August 31.

The following table summarizes the stock issuance activity under the 1989 ESPP and the
GESPP during each fiscal year ended September 30:

F-13


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

At September 30, 2004, there were 1,485,093 shares reserved for issuance under the 1989 ESPP, and there were
469,584 shares reserved for issuance under the GESPP.

Stock Option
Plans

We sponsor two, continuing, shareholder-approved stock option plans: the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the “1999 SIP”) and the
1999 Outside Director Stock Plan (the “1999 OSDP”). The 1999 SIP provides for the issuance of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options and restricted stock to employees. The 1999 OSDP provides for awards of stock and restricted
stock, and grants of nonqualified stock options to our outside (i.e., nonemployee) directors. The 1999 SIP and the 1999 OSDP (together, the “1999 Plans”) replaced our 1981 Executive Incentive Plan (the “1981 Plan”). After the
approval of the 1999 Plans by our shareholders in fiscal 2000, our Board of Directors resolved that no further stock incentive awards would be made under the 1981 Plan. The following table sets forth certain information about the 1999 SIP and 1999
OSDP:

The number of shares of common
stock that may be awarded under the 1999 SIP in the form of restricted stock is limited to 10% of the total number of shares authorized (or 560,000 shares), and shares of restricted stock that are subsequently forfeited become available again for
issuance as restricted stock. At September 30, 2004, there was a total of 426,000 shares of common stock that remained available for issuance in the form of restricted stock under the 1999 SIP.

The following table summarizes the stock option activity under the 1999 Plans and the
1981 Plan for each fiscal year ended September 30:

F-14


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Options outstanding at September 30, 2004 consisted entirely of nonqualified stock options. Included in the
number of options outstanding at September 30, 2004 were options to purchase 1,434,703 shares of common stock granted under the 1981 Plan. Certain other information regarding our stock option plans as of September 30, 2004 follows:

The following table presents
certain information regarding options outstanding, and options exercisable at September 30, 2004:

Our stock option plans allow
participants to satisfy the exercise price by tendering shares of our common stock that have been owned by the participants for at least six months. Shares so tendered are retired and canceled by us and are shown as repurchases of common stock in
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002, we issued 29,000, 23,000, and 27,000 shares, respectively, of restricted stock under our stock options plans. The restrictions generally relate to the recipient’s
ability to sell or otherwise transfer the stock. There are also restrictions that subject the stock to forfeiture back to us until earned by the recipient through continued employment or service.

The following table reconciles the denominator used to compute basic EPS to the denominator used to compute diluted EPS for each
fiscal year ended September 30 (in thousands):

5.    Business
Combinations

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we completed
the acquisition of the Babtie Group Limited (the “Babtie Group”) for a total cash purchase price of £92.0 million (approximately $169.3 million). The Babtie Group is a leading provider of technical and professional services to
clients in the infrastructure, facilities, environmental, defense, and governmental outsourcing markets, among others. Headquartered in Scotland, the Babtie Group employs approximately 3,500 people in offices located throughout the United Kingdom
and Asia, with smaller operations in India and the Czech Republic. The purchase price was financed through a combination of cash-on-hand and borrowings under our long-term, revolving credit facility. The primary purpose for acquiring the Babtie
Group was to expand our infrastructure and facilities business in the United Kingdom. Our consolidated results of operations include those of the Babtie Group from the date of acquisition.

The following table presents the unaudited, pro forma consolidated results of
operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 as if the acquisition of the Babtie Group had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2003. These pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of (i) the results of operations that
would have occurred had the Babtie Group actually been acquired at the beginning of fiscal 2003; and (ii) future results of operations. Amounts are presented in thousands of dollars, except for per-share amounts:

The following table presents the unaudited, condensed balance sheet of the Babtie Group as of the date of
acquisition (in thousands):

Immediately following the
acquisition, we engaged the services of a professional appraiser to assist us in determining the value of separately identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of the Babtie Group. The following table presents the
preliminary results of the valuation (in thousands):

The intangible assets subject to
amortization are included in “Other Noncurrent Assets” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2004, and are being amortized over lives that range from 2.5 years to 8 years (the weighted average life for all
intangibles is 5.9 years). The value of Babtie Group’s workforce in place is included in goodwill in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2004. The amount of goodwill created as a result of this transaction is summarized
as follows (in thousands):

Some of the factors contributing
to a purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill include: (i) the existence of a large, highly-trained and stable workforce; (ii) the opportunity to expand our client base in the United Kingdom and Asia; (iii) the existence of
operating synergies; and (iv) the existence of geographic synergies.

F-17


JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Following the completion of the acquisition of the Babtie Group, we initiated the purchase price allocation
process. This process, which is not yet completed due to the size of the acquisition and the fact that the transaction occurred so late in the fiscal year, resulted in increases to goodwill, net of taxes, primarily for an underfunded pension plan
(approximately $39.3 million); office consolidations and project-related reserves (approximately $10.2 million); and self-insurance reserves (approximately $6.2 million).

During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we completed the acquisition of McDermott Engineers & Constructors (Canada) Limited
(including Delta Catalytic and Delta Hudson Engineering) (collectively, “Delta”) for a total cash purchase price of $47.5 million. The primary purpose for acquiring Delta was to expand our business in North America in several markets,
including upstream oil and gas, petroleum refining, petrochemicals, chemicals and energy. The Delta acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include those of Delta from the date of acquisition.
The purchase price was allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill, net of related tax benefits, of approximately $51.5 million.

6.    Marketable Securities

Included in “Other Noncurrent Assets” in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheet at September 30, 2003 were available-for-sale equity securities of $0.3 million. The total cost of such securities (determined using the specific identification method) was approximately $0.1 million. During the year ended September
30, 2003, we realized gross, pre-tax gains totaling approximately $3.0 million from sales of such securities, and the gross, pre-tax proceeds received from such sales totaled approximately $5.2 million. The amount of available-for-sale marketable
securities held at September 30, 2004 was not significant.

7.    Property, Equipment and Improvements, Net

The following table presents the components of our property, equipment and improvements at September 30, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):

Operating expenses include
provisions for depreciation and amortization of $34.2 million, $35.4 million, and $35.1 million for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

8.    Borrowings

Short-Term Credit Arrangements

At September 30, 2004, we had approximately $38.6 million available through multiple, committed bank lines of credit, under which we may borrow on an overdraft or short-term basis. Interest under these lines is determined at
the time of borrowing based on the banks’ prime or base rates, rates paid on certificates of deposit, the banks’ actual costs of funds or other variable rates. Most of the agreements require the payment of a fee based on the amount of the
facility. Some of the agreements require us to be in compliance with the covenants, terms and conditions contained in our long-term, revolving credit facility (discussed below). Other agreements require us to maintain certain minimum levels of
working capital and net worth.

The following table presents certain
information regarding our lines of credit, both committed and uncommitted, for each fiscal year ended September 30 (dollars in thousands):

Long-term Debt and Credit
Arrangements

Amounts shown as “Long-term Debt” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets represent borrowings under our
$290.0 million, long-term, revolving credit facility. This facility expires in August 2008, and provides for unsecured borrowings at either fixed rates offered by the banks (a syndicate consisting of U.S., Canadian, and European banks) at the time
of borrowing, or at variable rates based on the agent bank’s base rate, LIBOR or the latest federal funds rate. The agreement requires us to maintain certain minimum levels of net worth, a minimum coverage ratio of certain fixed charges, and a
minimum leverage ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to funded debt (all as defined in the agreement). The agreement also restricts the payment of cash dividends and requires us to pay a facility fee based on the
total amount of the commitments. During fiscal 2004 and 2003, the weighted average interest rates charged on these borrowings were 3.49% and 3.75%, respectively.

Interest payments made during fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 totaled $2.4 million, $4.2 million, and $6.2 million, respectively.

9.    Pension Plans

Company-Only Sponsored Plans

We sponsor various defined benefit pension plans covering employees of certain U.S. and international subsidiaries. The one remaining U.S. pension plan, which was
acquired in connection with the 1999 merger with Sverdrup Corporation, was frozen in 1999 allowing no new participants to enter. As more fully explained below, a second U.S. pension plan acquired in connection with the Sverdrup merger was
transferred to another employer during fiscal 2003.

The pension plans provide pension benefits that are based on the employee’s compensation and years of
service. Our funding policy is to fund the actuarially determined accrued benefits, allowing for projected compensation increases using the projected unit method.

The following table sets forth
the change in the combined fair value of the plans’ assets for each fiscal year ended September 30 (in thousands):

During fiscal 2003, we ceased
being the sole, contributing sponsor of the Sverdrup Technology, Inc. Retirement Plan I (“SvT Plan I”), a pension plan we acquired as part of the 1999 merger with Sverdrup Corporation. SvT Plan I provided retirement benefits for certain
employees assigned to a particular cost-reimbursable contract with the U.S. federal government (the “AEDC Contract”). During fiscal 2003, the AEDC Contract was re-bid, and the winning contractor (Aerospace Testing Alliance, or
“ATA”) is an entity in which we retain an equity interest (the other owners of ATA are unrelated contractors who were providing services to the U.S. federal government at the same job site under separate contracts). As part of the process
of transferring the existing contracts and employees from the individual predecessor contractors to ATA, a separate, unrelated pension plan was merged into SvT Plan I, and SvT Plan I became the responsibility of ATA. The effect of these transactions
is referred to in the preceding tables as “transfer of plan sponsorship”. Under the terms of the AEDC Contract, we anticipate that the U.S. federal government will reimburse ATA, in accordance with applicable cost accounting standards, the
total cost of the merged pension plan.

3.5% to 4.3%

Expected rates of return on plan assets

6.0% to 9.0%

8.0% to 9.0%

8.0% to 9.5%

We consider various factors in
developing the estimate for the expected, long-term rate of return on plan assets. These factors include the projected rates of returns on the various types of assets in which the plans invest, as well as historical returns. The range of 6.0% to
9.0% expected rate of return used in the current valuation of the funded status of the plans was determined after considering the aforementioned factors. The plans’ weighted average asset allocations at June 30, 2004 and 2003 (the measurement
dates used in valuing the plans’ assets and liabilities) were as follows:

Although we have no target
allocation percentages for the various types of assets in which the plans may invest, the objectives of the plans’ investment policies are to (i) maximize returns while preserving capital; (ii) provide returns sufficient to meet the current and
long-term obligations of the plan as the obligations become due; and (iii) maintain a diversified portfolio of assets so as to avoid

concentration of investment risk in any one type of asset, issuer or geography. None of our pension plans hold a material amount of the common stock of Jacobs
Engineering Group Inc.

We anticipate our contributions into the plans
for fiscal 2005 will total approximately $26.9 million. Total benefit payments expected to be paid to the participants of our pension plans for each of the next five fiscal years, and in total for the five years thereafter, are as follows (in
thousands):

At September 30, 2004, our
pension plans were in a net, under-funded status by $153.5 million, compared to a net, under-funded status of $70.1 million at September 30, 2003.

The following table presents the components of net periodic pension cost recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each fiscal year
ended September 30 (in thousands):

Included in other comprehensive
income for fiscal 2004 are after-tax credits of $6.6 million relating to additional minimum liabilities for the pension plans. Included in other comprehensive income for fiscal 2003 and 2002 are after-tax charges of $13.1 million, and $31.2 million,
respectively, relating to additional minimum liabilities for the pension plans. In general, SFAS 87 requires companies to record a liability in the amount by which a pension plan’s accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of its
assets. This non-cash charge to stockholders’ equity will be reviewed next fiscal year in connection with the annual actuarial valuation of the pension plans and is subject to adjustment at that time.

In connection with the fiscal 2001 acquisition of certain engineering and contracting
businesses from Stork N.V., we are negotiating the value of certain plan assets and prior service obligations that may be transferred from a multiemployer pension plan into a new, single-employer pension plan we formed during fiscal 2004 for the
benefit of our employees in the Netherlands. If such a transfer were to occur presently, we believe the value of the assets we would receive would be less than the value of the prior service pension obligations we would assume. This difference would
be treated in a manner similar to unamortized prior service costs. Included in “Other Deferred Liabilities” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2004 is approximately $42.3 million for the prior service
obligations relating to the multiemployer pension plan in the Netherlands.

JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Multiemployer Plans

In the United States, we contribute to various trusteed pension plans covering hourly construction employees under industry-wide agreements. In selected operations in the Netherlands and the U.K., we contribute to multiemployer
plans covering both hourly and certain salaried employees. Contributions are based on the hours worked by employees covered under these agreements and are charged to direct costs of contracts on a current basis. Information from the plans’
administrators is not available to permit us to determine our share of unfunded benefits, if any. Our contributions to these plans totaled $39.2 million, $36.4 million, and $24.8 million for each of the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2004,
2003, and 2002, respectively.

10.    Savings and Deferred
Compensation Plans

Savings Plans

We maintain savings plans for substantially all of our domestic, nonunion employees. These plans allow participants to make contributions by salary deduction
pursuant to section 401(k) of the United States Internal Revenue Code. Our contributions to these plans totaled $20.4 million, $23.5 million, and $21.8 million, for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Company contributions are voluntary for
most of the savings plans, and represent a partial matching of employee contributions.

Deferred Compensation Plans

Our Executive Security Plan (“ESP”) and Executive Deferral Plans
(“EDP”) are nonqualified deferred compensation programs that provide benefits payable to directors, officers, and certain key employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future dates, upon retirement, or death. Benefit
payments under both plans are funded by a combination of contributions from participants and the Company, and most of the participants are covered by life insurance policies with the Company designated as the beneficiary. Amounts charged to expense
relating to these programs for each of the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002 were $4.9 million, $2.0 million, and $2.8 million, respectively.

11.    Income Taxes

The following table presents the components of our consolidated income tax expense for each fiscal year ended September 30 (in thousands):

Deferred taxes reflect the tax effects of the differences between the amounts recorded as assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the comparable amounts recorded for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected
to reverse. The following table presents the components of our net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):

During fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, we realized income tax benefits of $2.0 million, $3.8 million, and $6.1 million, respectively, relating to exercises of nonqualified stock options.

United States income taxes, net

million of such undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries was expected to be permanently reinvested. Should these earnings be repatriated, approximately $7.0 million of income taxes would be payable.

12.    Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

Commitments Under Operating Leases

We lease certain of our facilities and equipment under operating leases with net aggregate future lease payments of approximately $301.9 million at September 30,
2004 payable as follows (in thousands):

Rent expense for fiscal years
2004, 2003, and 2002 totaled $70.7 million, $66.3 million, and $65.2 million, respectively, and was offset by sublease income of approximately $6.9 million, $3.6 million, and $3.4 million, respectively. Operating leases relating to many of our major
offices generally contain renewal options, and provide for additional rental based on certain factors, including any escalation in operating expenses and real estate taxes.

Contingencies

In
connection with the acquisition of the Babtie Group, we entered into a forward contract with a large, U.S. bank in the notional amount of £39.9 million (approximately $73.4 million). The purpose of the contract was to hedge the
foreign-currency exchange cash flow exposure on a £39.9 million intercompany loan. We’ve determined the derivative to be highly effective according to the definitions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.

derivative is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2004 at its fair value. Changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other
comprehensive income and are released into earnings over the life of the forward contract. Amounts released during fiscal 2004 totaled $0.1 million. The fair value of the forward contract was approximately $0.3 million at September 30, 2004, and is
shown in “Other Noncurrent Assets” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees, litigation and investigations. Generally, such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance. Most of the litigation involves us
as a defendant in workers’ compensation, personal injury, environmental, environmental exposure, professional liability, and other similar lawsuits. We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. We have
elected, however, to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles, limits and retentions under our insurance programs. This situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured, or
completely uninsured. We intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts.

In addition, as a contractor for many agencies of the United States federal government, we are subject to many levels of audits,
investigations and claims by, or on behalf of, the U.S. federal government with respect to our contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations and procurement practices. Furthermore, our income, franchise, and similar tax returns and filings
are also subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states within the United States as well as by various government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the United States within which we operate.

Management believes, after consultation with counsel, that such guarantees, litigation,
United States Government contract-related audits, investigations and claims, and income tax audits and investigations should not have any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2004 totaled $81.5 million.

Guarantees

Prior to fiscal 2004, we leased certain real property located in Houston, Texas (property consisting of office space which we use in our operations) from a VIE.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the VIE sold the property to an unrelated third party that is not a VIE. Our lease agreement with the new owner of the property gives us the option to purchase the real property at the end of the lease term
in 2011 for $49.0 million. We also have the right to request an extension of the lease, or we may assist the owner in selling the property at the end of the lease term. The proceeds from any such sale would be used to reduce our end-of-term return
payment obligation of $35.3 million.

At September 30, 2004, we had
guaranteed the repayment of certain bank debt of an unconsolidated affiliate. The term of the guarantee is equal to the remaining term of the underlying debt, which is scheduled to terminate on July 31, 2005. We would be required to perform on the
guarantee in the event of default by the primary obligor. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this guarantee at September 30, 2004 is $4.0 million.

We have determined that the aggregate fair value of the aforementioned financial
guarantees is not significant at September 30, 2004.

13.    Common and Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue two classes of capital stock: common stock and preferred stock (each has a par value of $1.00 per share).
The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series. The number of shares to be included in a series as well as each series’ designation, relative powers, dividend and other preferences, rights and qualifications, redemption provisions, and
restrictions are to be fixed by our Board of Directors at the time each series is issued. Except as may be provided by the Board of Directors in a preferred stock designation, or otherwise provided for by statute, the holders of our common stock
have the exclusive right to vote for the election of Directors and all other matters requiring stockholder action. The holders of our common stock are entitled to dividends if and when declared by the Board of Directors from whatever assets are
legally available for that purpose.

Pursuant to our Amended and Restated
Rights Agreement dated December 20, 2000, each outstanding share of common stock has attached to it one stock purchase right (a “Right”). Each Right entitles the common stockholder to purchase, in certain circumstances generally relating
to a change in control of the Company, one one-hundredth of a share of our Series A Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) at the exercise price of $87.50 per share,
subject to adjustment. Alternatively, the Right holder may purchase our common stock having a market value equal to two times the exercise price, or may purchase shares of common stock of the acquiring corporation having a market value equal to two
times the exercise price.

The Series A Preferred Stock confers to its
holders, rights as to dividends, voting and liquidation which are in preference to common stockholders. The Rights are nonvoting, are not presently exercisable and currently trade in tandem with the common shares. In accordance with the Rights Plan,
we may redeem the Rights at $0.01 per Right. The Rights will expire on December 20, 2010, unless earlier exchanged or redeemed.

16.    Segment Information

As discussed above, our principal business is to provide a broad range of technical, professional, and construction services. We
provide our services primarily from offices located throughout the United States and Europe. With the acquisition of the Babtie Group in fiscal 2004, we expanded our operations in the United Kingdom. With the acquisition of the Delta companies in
fiscal 2002, we expanded our North American operations into Canada. We also have offices located in selected regions of Asia, Mexico and Australia.

All of our operations share similar economic characteristics. For example, all of our operations are highly influenced by the general availability of qualified
engineers and other technical professional staff. They also provide similar services as well as share similar processes for delivering our services. In addition, the use of technology is highly similar and consistent throughout our organization, as
is our client base (with the exception of our operations outside the United States, which perform very little work for the U.S. federal government), and our quality assurance and safety programs. Furthermore, the types of information and internal
reports used by management to monitor performance, evaluate results of operations, allocate resources, and otherwise manage the business, support a single reportable segment. Accordingly, based on these similarities, we have concluded that our
operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of this disclosure.

accounted for 22.3%, 22.6%, and 21.5%, respectively, of total revenues.

Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Jacobs Engineering Group
Inc. and subsidiaries at September 30, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Management’s Responsibilities for Financial Reporting

The Consolidated Financial Statements and other information included in this Form 10-K were prepared by management, who is responsible for their fairness, integrity, and objectivity. The Consolidated Financial Statements were
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, applied on a basis consistent with the prior year, and contain some amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. The other
financial information contained in this Form 10-K was prepared in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In meeting its responsibility for the fair presentation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, management necessarily relies on the Company’s
system of internal accounting controls. This system is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are executed in accordance with management’s instructions and are properly
recorded in the Company’s books and records. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that in any system of internal controls, there are certain inherent limitations and that the cost of such system should not exceed the
benefits to be derived. We believe the Company’s system of internal accounting controls is cost-effective and provides reasonable assurance that material errors and irregularities will be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements were audited by an
independent registered public accounting firm whose report thereon was based on examinations conducted in accordance with prescribed auditing standards and is presented on the previous page. As part of their audit, the independent auditors review
the Company’s system of internal accounting controls for the purpose of determining the amount of reliance to place on those controls relative to the audit tests they perform.

Management has provided written affirmation to the New York Stock Exchange that the Company is in compliance with the Exchange’s
membership, independence, and other requirements relating to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company’s Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors, meets regularly with both management and the
independent auditors to review the Company’s financial results and to ensure that both management and the independent auditors are properly performing their respective functions.
