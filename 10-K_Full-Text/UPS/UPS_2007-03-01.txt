PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

United Parcel Service, Inc. (“UPS”) is the world’s largest package delivery company and a global leader in supply chain management. We were
founded in 1907 as a private messenger and delivery service in Seattle, Washington. Today, we deliver packages each business day for 1.8 million shipping customers to 6.1 million consignees in over 200 countries and territories. In 2006,
we delivered an average of 15.6 million pieces per day worldwide. In addition, our supply chain solutions capabilities are available to clients in over 175 countries and territories.

Total revenue in 2006 was over $47.5 billion. Although our primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages and
documents, we have extended our capabilities in recent years to encompass the broader spectrum of services known as supply chain solutions, such as freight forwarding, customs brokerage, fulfillment, returns, financial transactions and even repairs.
We are also a leading provider of less-than-truckload (“LTL”) transportation services. We have established a global transportation infrastructure and a comprehensive portfolio of services and integrated solutions. We support these services
with advanced operational and customer-facing technology. Our supply chain solutions provide visibility into moving inventory across the global supply chain.

We believe the future is bright for this industry, for the following reasons:

•

Globalization of trade is a worldwide economic reality, which we believe will continue to expand as trade barriers are eliminated and large consumer markets, in
particular China, India and Europe, experience economic expansion.

•

We believe package shipments will continue to increase as a result of just-in-time inventory management, the increased use of the Internet for ordering goods and
direct-to-consumer business models. UPS is enhancing its ability to be a “warehouse in motion” for inventory on the move. The company is also an industry leader in the delivery of goods purchased over the Internet.

•

We believe the drive toward outsourcing supply chain management will continue, as customers increasingly view effective management of their supply chains as a
strategic advantage rather than a cost center.

Our vision for the future is to synchronize the world of commerce, managing the complexities of our customers’ supply chain needs. Our goal is to develop business solutions that create value and competitive advantages for any size
customers through product differentiation, better customer service and improved cash flow.

Competitive Strengths

Our competitive strengths include:

Global Reach
and Scale.

We believe that our integrated global ground and air network is the most extensive in the industry. It is the only network that handles all levels of service (express, ground, domestic, international,
commercial, residential) through one integrated pickup and delivery service system.

We operate a ground fleet of approximately 101,000 vehicles, ranging from custom-built package cars to large tractors and trailers, and utilize approximately 600 airplanes. In the contiguous U.S., we reach all
business and residential addresses. We are the eighth largest airline in the world. Our primary air hub is in Louisville, KY. Regional air hubs are located in Columbia, SC; Dallas, TX; Hartford, CT; Ontario, CA; Philadelphia, PA; and Rockford, IL.
Our largest international air hub is in Cologne, Germany, with other regional hubs in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Miami, FL and Pampanga, Philippines.


Index to Financial Statements

From the beginnings in Germany 30 years ago, our European network has grown significantly and now fully
supports air and ground shipments throughout the continent. We believe we have the most comprehensive integrated delivery and information services portfolio of any carrier in Europe. In other regions of the world, we rely on both our own and local
service providers’ capabilities to meet our service commitments.

Through more than two dozen alliances with Asian delivery companies that supplement company-owned operations, we currently serve more than 40 Asia Pacific countries and territories. Two of the fastest growing economies in the world, China
and India, are among our most promising opportunities.

Our
Canadian operations include both intra-Canada and import/export capabilities. We deliver to all addresses throughout Canada. We are also the largest air cargo carrier and a leading logistics provider in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Technology.

We are a global leader in
developing technology that helps our customers optimize their business processes to lower costs, improve service and increase efficiency. We have a strong global capability as a mover of electronic information. We currently collect electronic data
on 97% of the packages that move through our U.S. system each day – more than any of our competitors.

In 2003, we announced plans to re-engineer our package pickup and delivery processes, which we believe will result in gains in efficiency, reliability and
flexibility. Once the new technology is deployed in our package sorting facilities, we anticipate achieving savings through productivity improvements as well as in reduced fuel usage. By the end of 2006 we had deployed this technology for use by
almost 74% of our drivers.

Technology powers virtually every
service we offer and every operation we perform. Our technology initiatives are driven by our customers’ needs. We offer a variety of on-line service options that enable our customers to integrate UPS functionality into their own businesses not
only to conveniently send, manage and track their shipments, but to provide their customers with better information services. We provide the infrastructure for an Internet presence that extends to tens of thousands of customers who have integrated
UPS tools directly into their own web sites.

Broad,
Flexible Range of Services and Integrated Solutions.

Our portfolio of services enables customers to choose the delivery option that is most appropriate for their requirements. Substantially all of our U.S. small package
delivery services are guaranteed.

Our express air services are
integrated with our vast ground delivery system – one system handling all products. This integrated air and ground network enhances efficiency, improves productivity and asset utilization, and provides us with the flexibility to transport
packages using the most reliable and cost-effective transportation mode or combination of modes. Our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily basis. This unique, integrated global
business model creates consistent and superior returns – by far the best in our industry.

Increasingly, our customers benefit from business solutions that integrate many UPS services in addition to package delivery. We offer over 60 supply chain services – such as freight forwarding, customs
brokerage, order fulfillment, and returns management – that help improve efficiency of the supply chain management process.

Customer Relationships.

We focus on building and maintaining
long-term customer relationships. Thousands of customers access us daily through UPS On-Call Pickup

SM

for air and
ground delivery services. In addition, there are approximately 150,000 domestic and international access points to UPS. These include: nearly 40,000 branded drop-boxes, more than 1,000 UPS Customer Centers, over 5,800 independently owned and
operated The UPS Store

®

and Mail Boxes Etc.

®

locations worldwide (over 4,400 in the U.S.), more
than 2,400 Alliance partner locations, in excess of 15,000 Authorized Shipping Outlets and commercial counters – along with more than 85,000 UPS drivers who can accept packages given to them.


Index to Financial Statements

We place significant value on the quality of our customer relationships, and we conduct comprehensive
research to monitor customer perceptions. Since 1993, we have conducted telephone interviews with shipping decision-makers virtually every business day to determine their satisfaction with small package carriers and perception of performance on 19
service factors. Results from this survey for 2006 continue to show high levels of customer satisfaction.

Brand Equity.

We have built a leading and trusted brand in our industry – a brand that stands for quality service,
reliability and product innovation. The distinctive appearance of our vehicles and the friendliness and helpfulness of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity.

Distinctive Culture.

We believe that the dedication of our employees results in large part
from our distinctive “employee-owner” concept. Our employee stock ownership tradition dates from 1927, when our founders, who believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business, first offered stock to
employees. To facilitate employee stock ownership, we maintain several stock-based compensation programs.

Our long-standing policy of “promotion from within” complements our tradition of employee ownership, and this policy makes it generally
unnecessary for us to hire managers and executive officers from outside UPS. The vast majority of our management team began their careers as full-time or part-time hourly UPS employees, and has spent their entire careers with us. Our chief executive
officer and many of our executive officers have more than 30 years of service with UPS and have accumulated a meaningful ownership stake in our company. Therefore, our executive officers have a strong incentive to effectively manage UPS, which
benefits all our shareowners.

Financial
Strength.

Our balance sheet reflects financial strength that few companies can match. As of December 31, 2006, we had a balance of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments of
approximately $1.983 billion and shareowners’ equity of $15.482 billion. Long-term debt was $3.133 billion. We carry long-term debt ratings of AAA/Aaa from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively, reflecting our low use
of debt and strong capacity to service our obligations. Our financial strength gives us the resources to achieve global scale and to make investments in technology, transportation equipment and buildings as well as to pursue strategic opportunities
which will facilitate our growth.

Growth Strategy

Our growth strategy takes advantage of our competitive strengths while
maintaining our focus on meeting or exceeding our customers’ requirements. The principal components of our growth strategy are:

Build on Our Leadership Position in Our U.S. Business.

We believe that our tradition of reliable package delivery service,
our experienced and dedicated employees and our unmatched integrated air and ground network provide us with the advantages of reputation, service quality and economies of scale that differentiate us from our competitors. Our strategy is to increase
domestic revenue through cross-selling our existing and new services to our large and diverse customer base, to limit the rate of expense growth and to employ technology-driven efficiencies to increase operating profit.

Continued International Expansion.

We have
built a strong international presence through significant investments over several decades. The international package delivery market continues to grow at a faster rate than that of the U.S. We will use our worldwide infrastructure and broad product
portfolio to grow high-margin premium services and to implement cost, process and technology improvements in our international operations. Both Europe and Asia offer significant opportunities for growth.

Europe is our largest region outside the United States – accounting for
approximately half of our international revenue.


Index to Financial Statements

In early 2006, to accommodate growth opportunities across the whole of Europe, we completed the expansion
of our automated package sorting hub at the Cologne / Bonn airport in Germany. The expansion doubled the hub’s original sorting capacity to 110,000 packages per hour, largely through the deployment of new automation technology.

Growth in Asia will be driven by global demand, leading to improved
demographic and economic trends throughout the region, with specific emphasis on China and India. We continue to invest in infrastructure and technology in Asia. In 2002, we opened a new intra-Asia hub at Clark Air Force Base in Pampanga,
Philippines to enable future growth in the region. This hub allows us to compete more effectively in the Asian express market and improve our service between Europe and Asia.

In 2003, we received from the U.S. Department of Transportation the authority to expand service to and through Hong Kong,
including permanent authority to fly from Hong Kong to other cities, specifically to our Cologne hub in Europe. We continue our development efforts in the fast-growing China market.

In 2004, the U.S. Department of Transportation authorized us to significantly expand our air operations in China with the
award of 12 new frequencies, which tripled our access to China.

In 2005, we announced expansion plans to triple the intra-Asia hub’s sorting capacity from 2,500 packages to 7,500 packages per hour. In the same year, UPS became the first U.S. airline to launch non-stop service between the U.S. and
Guangzhou, which lies strategically in one of China’s fastest growing manufacturing regions. We also launched express delivery service for customers within China.

In 2006, we added another three daily flights between Shanghai, China and the U.S., and another new flight between Qingdao,
China and Incheon, Korea. We also began direct air service between Shanghai and Cologne with five flights per week. Those flights are supporting international express volume into and out of China, which has seen dramatic growth in recent quarters.
To continue our expansion, we plan to develop a new air hub in Shanghai. We also added two weekly flights between the U.S. and Australia.

Our Americas international gateway in Miami, Florida is the focal point for trade between Latin America and the U.S. This gateway complements our
operations in Florida and Latin America, and represents our commitment to the Americas market. We believe that there is long-term potential for us to expand our service offerings in Latin America and in 2006, UPS de Mexico enhanced territory
coverage by expanding to nine additional cities across Mexico. UPS de Mexico is now able to offer improved service and broader coverage to our customers in Mexico.

Provide Comprehensive Supply Chain Solutions.

In today’s global economy, entire
industries have outsourced all or part of their supply chains to streamline and gain efficiencies, to strengthen their balance sheets, to support new business models and to improve service. Companies’ global supply chains are growing
increasingly complex. This is creating further demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation, distribution and international trade services with financial and information services. We believe that we are well positioned to
capitalize on this growth for the following reasons:

•

We manage supply chains for large and small companies in over 175 countries and territories, with about 35 million square feet of distribution space and over 900
facilities worldwide.

•

We focus on supply chain redesign, freight forwarding, international trade services and management-based solutions for our customers rather than solely on more
traditional asset-based logistics such as warehouses and vehicle fleets.


Index to Financial Statements

•

We provide a broad range of transportation solutions to customers worldwide, including air, ocean and ground freight, as well as customs brokerage and trade and
materials management. We provide standardized service, information technology systems and specialized distribution facilities and services adapted to the unique supply chains of specific industries such as healthcare, technology, and
consumer/retail.

•

We offer a portfolio of financial services that provides customers with short-term and long-term financing, secured lending, working capital, government guaranteed
lending, letters of credit, global trade financing, credit cards and equipment leasing.

Leverage Our Leading-Edge Technology.

Our goal is to provide our customers with easy-to-use, flexible technology offerings
that streamline their shipment processing and integrate critical transportation information into their business processes, helping them create supply chain efficiencies, improve their cash flows and better serve their customers. Our leading-edge
technology has enabled our e-commerce partners to utilize UPS capabilities within their products by integrating UPS shipping and visibility functionality.

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Global Alliances.

Strategic acquisitions and global alliances play a significant role in
spurring growth. We look for opportunities that:

•

complement our global package business;

•

build our global brand;

•

enhance our technological capabilities or service offerings;

•

lower our costs; or

•

expand our geographic presence.

Products and Services

Domestic Package Products and Services.

Throughout our history, we have been engaged in the delivery of packages traveling
by ground transportation. We expanded this service gradually, and today our standard ground service is available to every address in the 48 contiguous United States. With the addition of Hawaii and Alaska, we were the first to reach every address in
all 50 states. We handle packages that weigh up to 150 pounds and are up to 165 inches in combined length and girth. We offer same-day pickup of air and ground packages. In 2006, we made the most significant upgrade ever to our U.S. ground package
delivery network, accelerating the transit times for more than a half-million packages nationwide by one day or more.

In addition to our standard ground delivery product, UPS Hundredweight Service

®

offers guaranteed, time-definite service to customers sending multiple package shipments having a combined weight of
200 pounds or more, or air shipments totaling 100 pounds or more, addressed to one recipient.

We provide domestic air delivery throughout the United States. UPS Next Day Air

®

offers guaranteed next business day delivery by 10:30 a.m. to 75% of the United States population and delivery by noon to areas covering an additional 15% of the population. We
offer Saturday delivery for UPS Next Day Air shipments for an additional fee. In 2006, we accelerated the guaranteed commit time for our UPS 2

International Package Products and Services.

We deliver international shipments to more than 200 countries and territories
worldwide, and we provide delivery within one to two business days to the world’s


Index to Financial Statements

major business centers. We offer a complete portfolio of import, export and domestic services. This portfolio includes guaranteed early morning, morning and
noon delivery to major cities around the world, as well as scheduled day-definite air and ground services. We offer worldwide customs clearance service for any mode of transportation.

In January 2007, we had the largest service expansion of our international shipping portfolio in more than a decade. UPS
began offering customers three, rather than two, daily time-definite delivery options to and from the world’s most active trading markets, giving customers the flexibility they need to manage their businesses. The changes expand the number of
early morning, morning and afternoon commit times UPS offers for urgent deliveries to and from cities throughout the world.

We classify our service as export (packages that cross national borders) and domestic (packages that stay within a single country’s boundaries). We
have a portfolio of domestic services in 23 major countries throughout the world.

The Trade Direct portfolio of ocean and air services integrates our small package and supply chain solutions capabilities to provide additional value to our international customers. In essence, the Trade Direct
service consolidates individually labeled packages or pallets into one movement across borders. When the goods arrive in the destination country, packages are deconsolidated and entered into the UPS system for delivery, often eliminating the
receiving, sorting and handling necessary in distribution centers. This service significantly cuts the supply chain cycle from point of origin to consignee. It also provides our customers with faster time to market, reduced costs, increased
visibility and better management of their global supply chain. In 2006, we completed the rollout of Trade Direct air and ocean services to facilitate export shipments from the U.S. and Canada to Europe, and introduced Trade Direct service inbound to
Japan. Previously in 2005, we had launched Trade Direct services outbound from Europe to the U.S., as well as inbound from Asia to Europe.

Mexico and Canada are also important to our international business. We developed the UPS Trade
Direct

SM

Cross Border service to manage package movements between the U.S. and these countries. This service
combines our small package, freight and brokerage capabilities to create an integrated, streamlined and economical door-to-door solution for customers with complex cross-border distribution needs. We are also the only carrier to offer guaranteed
8:00 a.m. next day delivery to most major metropolitan cities in Canada.

Starting on January 2, 2007, UPS introduced UPS Standard service support for the shipping of dangerous goods / hazardous materials, becoming the only carrier to offer a small package ground service for dangerous
goods between Canada and the United States.

portfolio of over 60 services. Among these are:

largest multi-shipping site customers, we manage sales through an organization of regionally-based account managers, reporting directly to our corporate office.

Our sales force also includes specialized groups that work together with our general sales organization to support the sale of customer technology
solutions, international package delivery, LTL and freight transportation, and warehousing and distribution services.

Our worldwide marketing organization also supports both our traditional U.S. domestic and international small package delivery business and our Supply
Chain & Freight business. Our corporate marketing function is engaged in market and customer research, brand management, rate-making and revenue management policy, new product development, product portfolio management, marketing alliances
and e-commerce, including the non-technical aspects of our web presence. Advertising, public relations, and most formal marketing communications are centrally developed and controlled.

In addition to our corporate marketing group, field-based marketing personnel are assigned to our individual operating
units, and are primarily engaged in business planning, bid preparation and revenue management activities. These local marketing teams support the execution of corporate initiatives while also managing limited promotional and public relations
activities pertinent to their local markets.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 428,000 employees.

We have received numerous awards and wide recognition as an
employer-of-choice, including the following:

•

In February 2006, we were rated “America’s Most Admired” company in our industry in a FORTUNE magazine survey, as well as ranked in the Top 20 among
all American companies. We achieved Top 10 rankings for “people management” and “management quality”.

•

In 2006, we were ranked in the Top 10 companies in

The Wall Street Journal / Harris Interactive

Corporate Reputation Study.

•

In February 2007, we were ranked eighth overall among 25 companies recognized in

Business Week’s

first-ever ranking of “Customer Service

In 2006, UPS was recognized by

Hispanic Business Magazine

as one of the top companies in the world for Hispanics in the workforce. Overall, 50 companies were
chosen based on their efforts to hire and retain those of Hispanic descent in their organization.

•

In August 2005,

Black Professionals Magazine

named UPS to its “Top 25 Companies for African Americans” list, based on workforce diversity
initiatives.

•

In September 2006, UPS ranked ninth in a survey of 152 brands ranked for corporate citizenship. Public relations firm GolinHarris interviewed 5,000
Americans, who rated 152 brands for the GolinHarris Corporate Citizenship Index (CCI).

•

UPS was recognized in 2006 as one of America’s most supportive companies of both black and Hispanic engineering students by two independent surveys. The fourth
annual survey by U.S. Black Engineer and Information Technology magazine named UPS as a private sector organization supportive of historically black engineering schools in the United States. A second survey, conducted by Hispanic Engineer and
Information Technology magazine, ranked UPS in the top five private sector organizations supportive of engineering schools at America’s Hispanic Serving Institutions.

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 246,000 employees employed
under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”). These agreements run through July 31, 2008. In the third quarter of
2006, we began formal negotiations with the Teamsters on a new agreement. We have approximately 2,800 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association (“IPA”). On June 30, 2006,
UPS and the IPA announced a tentative agreement on a new labor contract, which was ratified in the third quarter. This new contract becomes amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with
Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable on November 1, 2006. We began formal negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727 on October 2, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the
Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009.

We believe that our relations with our employees are good. Every year we survey all our employees to determine their level
of job satisfaction. Areas of concern receive management attention as we strive to keep UPS the employer of choice among our employees.

Competition

We are the largest package delivery company in the world, in terms of both revenue and volume. We offer a broad array of services in the package delivery
industry and, therefore, compete with many different companies and services on a local, regional, national and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the United States and other nations, various motor carriers, express
companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others.

We
believe one increasingly important element of competition is a carrier’s ability to integrate its distribution and information systems with its customers’ systems to provide transportation solutions at competitive prices. We rely on our
vast infrastructure and service portfolio to attract and maintain customers. As we expand our supply chain solutions service offerings, we compete with a number of participants in the supply chain, financial services and information technology
industries.

Government Regulation

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation
Security Administration (“TSA”), the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), regulates air transportation services.


Index to Financial Statements

The TSA regulates various security aspects of air cargo transportation in a manner consistent with the
TSA mission statement to “protect[s] the Nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.”

The DOT’s authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation, such as discriminatory pricing, non-competitive practices,
interlocking relations and cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates, subject to the authority of the President of the United States, international routes, fares, rates and practices, and is authorized to investigate and take action against
discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. We are subject to U.S. customs laws and related DOT regulations regarding the import and export of shipments to and from the U.S. In addition, our customs brokerage entities are subject to those
same laws and regulations as they relate to the filing of documents on behalf of client importers and exporters.

The FAA’s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, personnel and ground
facilities. In 1988, the FAA granted us an operating certificate, which remains in effect so long as we meet the operational requirements of federal aviation regulations.

FAA regulations mandate an aircraft corrosion control program, and aircraft inspection and repair at periodic intervals
specified by approved programs and procedures, for all aircraft. Our total expenditures under these programs for 2006 were $18 million. The future cost of repairs pursuant to these programs may fluctuate. All mandated repairs have been completed, or
are scheduled to be completed, within the timeframes specified by the FAA.

Our ground transportation of packages in the U.S. is subject to the DOT’s jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of routes and to both the DOT’s and the states’ jurisdiction with respect to the
regulation of safety, insurance and hazardous materials.

We
are subject to similar regulation in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights to and beyond non-U.S. jurisdictions, and non-U.S. customs regulation.

The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created the U.S. Postal Service as an
independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government, and vested the power to recommend domestic postal rates in a regulatory body, the Postal Rate Commission. We participate in the proceedings before the Postal Rate
Commission in an attempt to secure fair postal rates for competitive services.

We are subject to numerous other laws and regulations in connection with our non-package businesses, including customs regulations, Food and Drug Administration regulation of our transportation of pharmaceuticals and
state and federal lending regulations.

Properties

Operating Facilities

We own our headquarters, which are located in Atlanta, Georgia and consist of about 735,000 square feet of office space on an office campus, and our UPS
Supply Chain Solutions group’s headquarters, which are located in Alpharetta, Georgia and consist of about 310,000 square feet of office space.

We also own our 27 principal U.S. package operating facilities, which have floor spaces that range from about 310,000 to 693,000 square feet. In addition,
we have a 1.9 million square foot operating facility near Chicago, Illinois, which is designed to streamline shipments between East Coast and West Coast destinations, and we own or lease over 1,600 additional smaller package operating
facilities in the U.S. The smaller of these facilities have vehicles and drivers stationed for the pickup of packages and facilities for the sorting, transfer and delivery of packages. The larger of these facilities also service our vehicles and
equipment and employ specialized mechanical installations for the sorting and handling of packages.

We own or lease almost 600 facilities that support our international package operations and over 900 facilities that support our freight forwarding and
logistics operations. Our freight forwarding and logistics operations maintain facilities with about 35 million square feet of floor space. We own and operate a logistics campus consisting of approximately 3.5 million square feet in
Louisville, Kentucky.

UPS Freight operates over 200 service
centers with a total of 5.5 million square feet of floor space. UPS Freight owns 141 of these service centers, while the remainder are occupied under operating lease agreements. The main offices of UPS Freight are located in Richmond, Virginia
and consist of about 240,000 square feet of office space.

Our
aircraft are operated in a hub and spokes pattern in the U.S. Our principal air hub in the U.S., known as Worldport, is located in Louisville, KY. The Worldport facility consists of over 3.5 million square feet and the site includes
approximately 596 acres. We are able to sort over 300,000 packages per hour in the Worldport


Index to Financial Statements

facility. We also have regional air hubs in Columbia, SC; Dallas, TX; Hartford, CT; Ontario, CA; Philadelphia, PA; and Rockford, IL. These hubs house
facilities for the sorting, transfer and delivery of packages. Our European air hub is located in Cologne, Germany, and our Asia-Pacific air hub is located in Taipei, Taiwan. Our intra-Asia air hub is located at Clark Air Force Base in Pampanga,
Philippines, our regional air hub in Canada is located in Hamilton, Ontario, and our regional air hub for Latin America and the Caribbean is in Miami, FL.

In 2006, we announced a major expansion to our Worldport facility that will increase the sorting capacity over the next five years by 60 percent to
487,000 packages per hour. The expansion involves the addition of three aircraft load / unload wings to the hub building, followed by the installation of high-speed conveyor and computer control systems. The overall size of the Worldport facility
will increase by 1.1 million square feet to 5.1 million square feet, and the facility will be able to accommodate the Airbus A380-800 and Boeing 747-400 aircraft currently on order. The expansion will cost over $1 billion and is expected
to be completed by 2010.

In 2006, we closed the former Menlo
Worldwide Forwarding air freight facility in Dayton, OH, and integrated the former Menlo Worldwide Forwarding air freight business into other UPS facilities, including a new facility in Louisville consisting of approximately 715,000 square feet and
five new regional air freight facilities in Ontario, CA; Rockford, IL; Dallas, TX; Philadelphia, PA; and Columbia, SC that have a combined square footage of 269,000.

Our primary information technology operations are consolidated in a 435,000 square foot owned facility, the Ramapo Ridge
facility, which is located on a 39-acre site in Mahwah, New Jersey. We also own a 175,000 square foot facility located on a 25-acre site in Alpharetta, Georgia, which serves as a backup to the main information technology operations facility in New
Jersey. This facility provides production functions and backup capacity in the event that a power outage or other disaster incapacitates the main data center. It also helps us to meet our internal communication needs.

We believe that our facilities are adequate to support our current
operations.

Fleet

Aircraft

The following table shows information about our aircraft fleet as of December 31, 2006, including the Boeing 767-300
order discussed further below:


Index to Financial Statements

We maintain an inventory of spare engines and parts for each aircraft.

All of the aircraft we own meet Stage III federal noise regulations and can
operate at airports that have aircraft noise restrictions. We became the first major airline to successfully operate a 100% Stage III fleet more than three years in advance of the date required by federal regulations.

During 2006, we took delivery of 13 Boeing MD-11 aircraft and six Airbus
A300-600 aircraft. We have firm commitments to purchase four Boeing MD-11 aircraft, and we expect to take delivery of these aircraft during 2007. In February 2007, we announced an order for 27 Boeing 767-300ER freighters to be delivered between 2009
and 2012 (this order is reflected in the table above). We also have firm commitments to purchase eight Boeing 747-400F aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2007 and 2008, and two Boeing 747-400BCF aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2008.

In addition, we currently have a firm commitment to purchase
10 Airbus A380-800 freighter aircraft and options to purchase 10 additional A380-800 aircraft. In February 2007, we announced that we had signed an agreement with Airbus to set out a timetable for deciding the status of this previous order. The
agreement specifies changed delivery dates for the A380-800 and provides for possible termination of the original purchase agreement by either party later in 2007. The revised delivery schedule specifies the delivery dates for the 10 Airbus
A380-800’s on order as being between 2012 and 2013, whereas we were originally scheduled to take delivery of the Airbus A380-800 aircraft between 2009 and 2012. The signing of this agreement will have no material impact on our results of
operations or financial condition.

Vehicles

We operate a ground fleet of approximately 101,000 package cars, vans,
tractors and motorcycles. Our ground support fleet consists of over 26,000 pieces of equipment designed specifically to support our aircraft fleet, ranging from non-powered container dollies and racks to powered aircraft main deck loaders and cargo
tractors. We also have about 41,000 containers used to transport cargo in our aircraft.

Safety

We promote safety throughout our
operations. Our Automotive Fleet Safety Program is built with the following components:

•

Selection.

Five out of every six drivers come from our part-time ranks. Therefore, many of our new drivers are familiar with our philosophies, policies,
practices and training programs.

•

Training.

Training is the cornerstone of our Fleet Safety Program. Our approach starts with training the trainer. All trainers are certified to ensure that
they have the skills and motivation to effectively train novice drivers. A new driver’s employment includes extensive classroom and on-line training as well as on-road training, followed by three safety training rides integrated into his or her
training cycle.

•

Responsibility.

Our operations managers are responsible for their drivers’ safety records. We investigate every accident. If we determine that an
accident could have been prevented, we retrain the driver.

•

Preventive Maintenance.

An integral part of our Fleet Safety Program is a comprehensive Preventive Maintenance Program. Our fleet is tracked by computer to
ensure that each vehicle is serviced before a breakdown or accident is likely to occur.

•

Honor Plan.

A well-defined safe driver honor plan recognizes and rewards our drivers when they achieve success. We have over 4,200 drivers who have driven
for 25 years or more without an avoidable accident.

Our workplace safety program is built upon a comprehensive health and safety process. The foundation of this process is our employee-management health and safety committees. The workplace safety process focuses


Index to Financial Statements

on employee conditioning and safety-related habits. Our employee co-chaired health and safety committees complete comprehensive facility audits and injury
analyses, and recommend facility and work process changes.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class-action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws.
In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and
attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,200 full-time supervisors. The court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS on all claims and plaintiffs have appealed. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims
and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

In another
case, Cornn v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they were improperly denied wages and/or overtime and meal and rest periods. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of
approximately 23,600 drivers and seek back wages, penalties, interest and attorneys’ fees. UPS has agreed in principle to settle this matter in full for a total payment of $87 million. On December 6, 2006, the court granted tentative approval
of the settlement.

We are named as a defendant in four
putative class action lawsuits filed in federal courts, alleging a conspiracy relating to certain surcharges by a number of air cargo carriers. We are not named as a defendant in at least eighty-six related cases that make similar allegations. These
cases have been consolidated in a Multi-District Litigation proceeding pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. UPS was not included as a defendant in the amended consolidated complaint on which the
Multi-District Litigation is proceeding. In addition, in July 2006, we were named as a defendant in a comparable lawsuit filed in the Ontario (Canada) Superior Court of Justice. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases.

We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course
of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Our Class A common stock is not listed on a national securities
exchange or traded in an organized over-the-counter market, but each share of our Class A common stock is convertible into one share of our Class B common stock.

The following is a summary of our Class B common stock price activity and dividend information for 2006 and 2005. Our Class
B common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “UPS.”

As of January 31,
2007, there were 174,096 and 17,237 record holders of Class A and Class B common stock, respectively.

The policy of our Board of Directors is to declare dividends each year out of current earnings. The declaration of future dividends is subject to the
discretion of the Board of Directors in light of all relevant facts, including earnings, general business conditions and working capital requirements.

On February 8, 2007, our Board declared a dividend of $0.42 per share, which is payable on March 6, 2007 to shareowners of record on
February 20, 2007.

In February 2007, the Board of
Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2.0 billion. This amount replaced the remaining authority available under the previously authorized $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved in July 2006. Unless
terminated earlier by the resolution of our Board, the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program.

A summary of repurchases of our Class A and Class B common stock during the fourth quarter of 2006 is as follows (in millions, except per share

U.S. Domestic Package Operations

2006 compared to 2005

U.S. Domestic Package revenue increased $1.846 billion, or 6.5%, for the year, with average daily package volume up 4.4%.
Volume gains were realized across all products primarily due to a solid U.S. economy, strong small package market and continuing efforts to generate new volume. Overall domestic volume growth moderated in the latter half of 2006 compared with 2005,
due to slower overall economic growth in the U.S. and a downturn in industrial production during the fourth quarter.

Pricing remained firm as overall revenue per piece was up 2.5% for the year. Ground revenue per piece increased 2.7% and Next Day Air revenue per piece
increased 3.3% for the year, primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2006 and the impact of an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2006 compared to 2005. Deferred revenue per piece increased 0.5% for the year for the same
reasons, but was adversely affected by the growth in lighter weight, lower revenue packages.

On January 2, 2006, a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years’ rate increases. We increased rates 5.5% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 3.9% on UPS
Ground. Other pricing changes included a new charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts and an increase in rates for proof of delivery features for our Delivery Required and Signature Confirmation services. The residential
surcharge increased $0.25 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select.

In January 2006, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The air fuel
surcharge was subject to a maximum cap of 12.50% through June 4, 2006. Effective June 5, 2006, we reduced the index by another 2% and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge. This fuel surcharge continues to be based on the U.S.
Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 14.02% in 2006, as compared with 10.23% in 2005. Additionally, the UPS Ground
fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 4.13% in 2006, as compared to 2.86% in 2005. Total
domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $542 million in 2006, due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices, volume growth, and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above. These fuel surcharges are used to provide some protection against
the increased fuel expense that we incur due to higher fuel prices, as well as the increased purchased transportation expense which is also affected by higher fuel prices.

U.S. Domestic Package operating profit increased $430 million, or 9.6%, for the year, and the operating margin increased by
approximately 50 basis points to 16.2%. This increase was primarily a result of the revenue growth described previously, combined with efficiencies from leveraging our integrated ground and air networks. The 2006 operating profit for our U.S.
Domestic Package segment was negatively impacted by a tentative settlement of a class action litigation (see “Contingencies” section below), which resulted in an $87 million charge to expense.

The expense associated with our self-insurance accruals for workers’
compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities was $83 million less in 2006 compared with 2005. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as
estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on ultimate reserve levels determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels
of cost per claim. The lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from company initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors, including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies, improved oversight and
management of claims, improved trends in health care costs, and favorable state legislative reforms, primarily in California.


Index to Financial Statements

2005 compared to 2004

U.S. Domestic Package revenue increased $1.650 billion, or 6.1%, for the year, primarily due to a 3.4% increase in average daily package volume and a 2.5%
increase in revenue per piece. Ground volume grew 3.4%, and was positively impacted by a solid U.S. economy and our focus on middle market sales initiatives. Next Day Air volume grew 2.8% and deferred volume increased 4.0%, with growth in the
manufacturing, business services, telecommunications and retail sectors. The growth in total U.S. Domestic Package volume strengthened throughout the year.

Ground revenue per piece increased 3.7% for the year, primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2005, as well as the
implementation of a fuel surcharge on ground products. Next Day Air revenue per piece increased 2.0% for the year, primarily due to the rate increase and an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2005 compared to 2004. Next Day Air revenue per piece was
adversely affected by relatively higher growth in our Saver product. Both Next Day Air and deferred revenue per piece were adversely affected by lighter average package weights.

On January 3, 2005, a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years’ rate increases. We
increased rates 2.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, UPS 3 Day Select, and UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included an increase of $0.25 for delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. The
residential surcharge increased $0.10 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select.

In January 2005, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by setting a maximum cap of 9.50%, which was increased to 12.50% effective in
October 2005. This fuel surcharge continued to be based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 10.23% in
2005, as compared with 7.07% in 2004. Additionally, an initial fuel surcharge of 2.00% was applied to UPS Ground services in January 2005, which fluctuated based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published
rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 2.86% in 2005. Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $683 million for the year, due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices, volume increases, and the modifications to our
fuel surcharges noted above.

U.S. Domestic Package operating
profit increased $791 million, or 21.4%, for the year, and domestic operating margin increased by 200 basis points. Operating profit increased by $274 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in
“Operating Expenses”), which also favorably impacted the operating margin. The remaining increase in operating profit and margin resulted from the revenue growth described previously, as well as controlled growth of operating expenses.

International Package Operations

2006 compared to 2005

International Package revenue improved $1.112 billion, or 13.9%, for the year, primarily due to the 11.9% volume growth for
our export products and the impact of acquisitions completed in 2005. Total international revenue per piece declined slightly for the year due to changes in product mix, as lower-yielding domestic products comprised a larger proportion of overall
international volume. The change in revenue was positively affected by $83 million during the year due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity. Revenue increased by $247 million during the year due to business acquisitions completed
previously.

In January 2006, we increased rates 5.5% for
international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States
varied by geographical market and occurred throughout the year.


Index to Financial Statements

Also in January 2006, we modified the fuel surcharge on certain U.S.-related international air services
by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The air fuel surcharge continued to remain subject to a maximum cap of 12.5% through June 4, 2006. Effective June 5, 2006, we reduced the index by another 2% and no longer
applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending upon where the shipment takes place. Total
international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $189 million during the year due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume.

Export volume increased throughout the world, with solid volume increases in Europe, Asia, and U.S. export products. Asian export volume continues to
benefit from geographic service expansion and strong economic growth in Asia, while European export volume gains are impacted by our growing transborder business and the expansion of the European Union. International domestic volume increased 21.0%
for the year, due to volume growth in Canada and Europe, which also benefited from the acquisition of Stolica in Poland during the second quarter of 2005 and the acquisition of Lynx in the U.K. during the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact
of acquisitions, international domestic volume and revenue increased 6.9% and 8.3%, respectively, for the year.

Export revenue per piece increased 0.5% for the year, largely due to the rate increases discussed previously, the impact of the fuel surcharge, and
currency fluctuations, partially offset by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products. For the year, total international average daily package volume increased 17.3%, while average revenue per piece decreased 2.2%
(decreased 3.3% currency-adjusted).

The improvement in
operating profit for our International Package segment was $216 million for the year, or 14.5%, and the operating margin increased 10 basis points to 18.8%. The increases in operating profit and margin were driven by the volume and revenue growth
described previously. The change in operating profit was also positively affected by $26 million during the year due to currency fluctuations.

2005 compared to 2004

International Package revenue improved $1.168 billion, or 17.2%, for the year, primarily due to the 13.9% volume growth for our export products and
revenue per piece improvements. The improvements in revenue per piece were impacted by rate changes, currency fluctuations, and the fuel surcharge applied to international shipments. Revenue increased $121 million during the year due to currency
fluctuations, net of hedging activity, and also increased by $133 million during the year due to business acquisitions.

In January 2005, we increased rates 2.9% for international shipments originating in the United States, which includes our Worldwide Express, Worldwide
Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard services. Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States varied by geographical market and occured throughout the year.

In January 2005, we modified the fuel surcharge on U.S. export products by
setting a maximum cap of 9.50%, which was increased to 12.50% effective in October 2005. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continued to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending
upon where the shipment takes place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $246 million during the year, due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume.

Export volume increased throughout the world, with strong growth in Asia and
Europe. Asian export volume, which increased 29% for the year, was driven by export growth from China. Asian export volume continues to benefit from our expanding international delivery network, including the additional flights from Shanghai, China
that were added in the fourth quarter of 2004, and express air service between the U.S. and Guangzhou, China that began in the second quarter of 2005. European export volume increased 13% for the year, while export volume from the U.S. and Americas
also showed solid increases. International domestic volume

increased 12.4% for the year, due to volume growth in Canada and Europe, which also benefited from the acquisition of Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in
Poland during the second quarter of 2005 and Lynx Express Ltd. in the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, international domestic volume increased 3.7%.

Export revenue per piece increased 3.1% for the year (1.4%
currency-adjusted), due to the rate increases discussed previously and the impact of the fuel surcharge, but was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder product. In total, international average daily
package volume increased 13.0% and average revenue per piece increased 4.0% (2.4% currency-adjusted).

The improvement in operating profit for our International Package operations was $345 million for the year, or 30.0%, with an increase in the operating
margin of 180 basis points. This increase in operating profit and margin was positively impacted by the strong volume growth described previously, as well as better network utilization due to volume growth and geographic service expansion. The
increase in operating profit was also favorably affected by $78 million due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense (net of hedging activity), and by $45 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program
(discussed below in “Operating Expenses”). Operating profit was negatively affected in 2005 by $23 million in currency repatriation losses, as compared with repatriation gains of $32 million in 2004.

Supply Chain & Freight Operations

2006 compared to 2005

Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $2.008 billion, or 33.5%, for the year. UPS Freight, formerly known as
Overnite Corp., provided $1.155 billion of the increase in revenue for the year. Excluding the impact of the Overnite acquisition in August 2005, segment revenues grew 16.4% for the year. Total average daily LTL shipments for UPS Freight in 2006
declined against the full year 2005 (both the pre and post-acquisition period) due to service issues caused by the integration of the UPS Freight business, as well as a weakening in the overall LTL market in the United States in the latter half of
2006. LTL revenue per LTL hundredweight increased as we proactively reduced less profitable accounts and focused on higher yielding customer segments.

Forwarding and logistics revenue increased $822 million, or 16.9% for the year, largely due to continued changes in the business model for this unit. The
forwarding and logistics business is moving towards a model that places more transactional ownership risk on UPS, including increased utilization of UPS-owned assets. This has the effect of increasing revenue as well as purchased transportation
expense. The increased revenue associated with these forwarding transactions was somewhat offset by certain revenue management initiatives, which involved reducing less profitable accounts. In addition, revenue increased by $29 million during the
year due to currency fluctuations.

The other businesses within
Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business and our financial business, increased revenue by 9.2% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased financial services revenue, as well as revenue
earned from our previously-announced contract to provide domestic air transportation for the U.S. Postal Service.

For the year, the Supply Chain & Freight segment reported $2 million in operating profit, as compared with a $156 million in operating profit for
2005. These results were impacted by the integration of the acquired Menlo Worldwide Forwarding business into our air network, and the integration of the Motor Cargo business unit within the acquired Overnite Corp. operations into the UPS Freight
network. The UPS Freight integration led to service issues, which resulted in a loss of revenue, as well as productivity setbacks resulting in increased costs. The integration of the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding business resulted in increased costs
and some lost sales resulting from customer turnover. The increase in operating profit was positively affected by $2 million during 2006 due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense.


Index to Financial Statements

In an effort to rationalize our cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth, we initiated a
restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in the fourth quarter of 2006. This restructuring plan is expected to generate efficiencies resulting in improved operating profits by further integrating all of our transportation
services to better serve our customers. This restructuring involves plans to reduce non-operating expenses by approximately 20%, including a reduction in non-operating staff of approximately 1,400 people. As of December 31, 2006, $12 million in
costs have been accrued related to employee severance.

2005 compared to

Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased
$3.181 billion, or 113.1%, for the year. Forwarding services and logistics revenue increased by $2.383 billion during the year, largely due to the acquisition of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding in December 2004. The growth in our existing forwarding
services and logistics businesses (excluding Menlo Worldwide Forwarding) was driven by solid growth in our ocean and ground forwarding operations. Revenue increased by $17 million during the year due to favorable currency fluctuations. Overall
growth continues to benefit from the expansion of our freight forwarding network throughout the world, as well as the increase in global trade and the increased outsourcing of manufacturing and distribution.

During the third quarter of 2005, we completed our acquisition of Overnite
Corp., now known as UPS Freight, which offers a variety of LTL and truckload services to customers in North America. Overnite’s results have been included in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment since the August 5, 2005
acquisition date. Overnite generally reported improvements in its operating performance measures in the post-acquisition period versus the same period a year ago when it was not a part of UPS, including improvements in average daily LTL shipments
and average LTL revenue per LTL hundredweight.

The other
businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business, our mail and consulting services, and our financial business, increased revenue by 0.3% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to
increased revenue at our mail and financial services units.

Operating profit for the Supply Chain & Freight segment increased by $18 million, or 13.0%, for the year, largely due to the operating profits generated by Overnite. Operating profit and margin were negatively affected by operating
losses incurred in the acquired Menlo Worldwide Forwarding operations, as well as costs incurred in integrating this business into our existing forwarding services business. Currency fluctuations positively affected operating profit by $4 million
during the year. Operating profit also was favorably impacted by $15 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in “Operating Expenses”).

Operating Expenses

2006 compared to 2005

Consolidated operating expenses increased by $4.474 billion, or 12.3%, for the year, and were significantly impacted by the
acquisitions of Overnite, Stolica, and Lynx. Currency fluctuations in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments resulted in operating expenses increasing by $84 million for the year.

Compensation and benefits increased by $1.904 billion, or 8.5%, for the year,
largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense. These increases were partially offset by the decline in workers compensation expense, as previously discussed.
Excluding the effect of acquisitions, compensation and benefits expense increased 5.1% for the year. Stock-based and other management incentive compensation expense increased $49 million, or 8.0% in 2006, due to the expensing of restricted stock
units granted in the fourth quarter of 2005, the impact of a new grant of stock options and restricted performance units in the second quarter of 2006, and the impact of adopting the non-substantive vesting period approach of FAS 123R (discussed
further in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). These grants were partially offset by lower accruals for our Management Incentive Awards program in 2006.


Index to Financial Statements

Other operating expenses increased by $2.570 billion, or 18.5%, for the year, largely due to the
acquisitions mentioned above, as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation. The table below indicates the impact of business acquisitions completed in 2005 on the increase in operating expenses by category in 2006.

Excluding the effect
of acquisitions, the 20.2% increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet-A, diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as higher usage, but was partially mitigated by hedging gains. The 30.1% increase in purchased
transportation was influenced by volume growth in our International Package business, currency fluctuations, higher fuel prices, increased rail costs, and changes to the freight forwarding business model described previously. The 2.3% increase in
repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased expense on airframe and engine repairs. The 3.2% increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was caused primarily by higher depreciation expense on plant equipment, aircraft and
engines, and higher amortization expense on intangible assets. The 3.4% increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher electricity and other utilities expenses. The increase in other expenses was impacted by several items, including
the $87 million tentative settlement of a class action litigation (see “Contingencies” section below).

2005 compared to 2004

Consolidated operating expenses increased by $4.845 billion, or 15.3%, for the year, and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of Menlo
Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite. Operating expenses also increased $56 million for the year due to the impact on revenue and expense of currency fluctuations (net of hedging activity) in our International Package and Supply Chain &
Freight segments, and increased $55 million for the year due to currency repatriation losses in our International Package segment.

Compensation and benefits increased by $1.694 billion, or 8.1%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite,
as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense for our union benefit plans. Stock-based and other management incentive compensation expense decreased $297 million, or 33.4%, in the year, due to a change in our
Management Incentive Awards program implemented in 2005, described in the next paragraph, which was partially offset by the impact of prospectively adopting the measurement provisions of FAS 123 beginning with 2003 stock-based compensation awards.

During the first quarter of 2005, we modified our Management
Incentive Awards program under our Incentive Compensation Plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units (“RSUs”). The RSUs granted in November 2005 under this program have a five-year graded vesting
period, with approximately 20% of the total RSU award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant. The other half of the award granted in November 2005 was in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of Class A common stock and was fully
vested at the time of grant. Previous awards under the Management Incentive Awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant. This change had the effect of lowering 2005 expense. As a result, 2005 expense for our
Management Incentive Awards program (reported in operating expenses under “compensation and benefits”), including the RSUs, decreased $334 million ($213 million after-tax, or $0.19 per diluted share) compared with 2004.


Index to Financial Statements

Other operating expenses increased by $3.151 billion, or 29.3%, for the year, largely due to the Menlo
Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite acquisitions, as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation. The 47.2% increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet-A, diesel and unleaded gasoline, as well as
higher fuel usage, but was partially mitigated with hedging gains. The 95.5% increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding acquisition, but was also influenced by volume growth in our International Package
business and higher fuel prices. The 9.2% increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to higher expense on vehicle parts (partially affected by the Overnite acquisition), airframe and aircraft engine maintenance. The 6.5% increase in
depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by higher depreciation expense on buildings (largely due to acquisitions), aircraft, and capitalized software. The 16.0% increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher facilities
rent expense in our Supply Chain & Freight segment, which was impacted by the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding acquisition, and increased utilities expense. The 4.5% increase in other expenses was primarily due to the Overnite acquisition, but
partially offset by the absence in 2005 of the $110 million aircraft impairment charge that we incurred in 2004.

Investment Income and Interest Expense

2006 compared to 2005

The decrease in investment income of $18 million during the year was primarily due to a lower average balance of interest-earning investments, due to the
timing of cash payments for pension fundings, business acquisitions, and capital expenditures. This was partially offset by a higher average interest rate earned on investments, as well as the absence of any investment impairments during 2006 ($16
million of investment impairments were recognized in 2005, as described below).

The $39 million increase in interest expense during the year was primarily due to higher average interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps, as well as interest expense incurred on debt related to
real estate investment partnerships. This was partially offset by slightly lower average debt balances during 2006, as well as higher capitalized interest due to large aircraft contract deposit payments made during the year.

2005 compared to 2004

The increase in investment income of $22 million during the year was primarily due to higher average yields earned caused by
the increasing short-term interest rates in the United States, but partially offset by a lower average balance of interest-earning investments, increased equity-method losses on certain investment partnerships, and an investment impairment charge on
certain available-for-sale securities. We periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors, including the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value has been less than its
cost, overall economic and market conditions, and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer. After considering these factors, we recorded an impairment charge of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to several
variable rate preferred securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC).

The $23 million increase in interest expense for the year was primarily due to higher floating interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate
swaps, as well as higher imputed interest expense associated with real estate investment partnerships.

Net Income and Earnings Per Share

2006 compared to 2005

Net income for 2006 was $4.202 billion, an 8.6% increase from the $3.870 billion achieved in 2005, resulting in a 11.2% increase in diluted earnings per
share to $3.86 in 2006 from $3.47 in 2005. Net income in 2006 benefited from a $52 million reduction in income tax expense ($0.05 impact to diluted earnings per share)


Index to Financial Statements

due to favorable developments with certain U.S. Federal tax contingency matters involving non-U.S. operations. Diluted earnings per share has increased at a
faster rate than the growth in net income due to the reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program. The increase in net income for 2006 was largely due to higher operating profits for both our U.S. Domestic and
International Package segments.

2005 compared to 2004

Net income for 2005 was $3.870 billion, a 16.1% increase from the $3.333
billion achieved in 2004, resulting in an 18.4% increase in diluted earnings per share to $3.47 in 2005 from $2.93 in 2004. The increase in net income for 2005 was largely due to higher operating profit for both our U.S. Domestic and International
Package segments. Net income was adversely impacted by an increase in our effective tax rate to 36.3% in 2005 from 32.3% in 2004. The lower tax rate in 2004 was impacted by credits to income tax expense totaling $142 million ($0.13 per diluted
share) related to various items, including the resolution of certain tax matters, the removal of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards, and an adjustment for identified tax
contingency items.

Net income in 2004 was adversely impacted
by a $70 million after-tax impairment charge ($0.06 per diluted share) on Boeing 727, 747, and McDonnell Douglas DC-8 aircraft, engines, and parts, as well as a $40 million after-tax charge ($0.04 per diluted share) to pension expense resulting from
the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net Cash From Operating
Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was
$5.589, $5.793, and $5.331 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The decrease in 2006 operating cash flows compared with 2005 was primarily due to higher pension and retirement plan fundings, but partially offset by increased net income. In
2006, we funded $1.625 billion to our pension and postretirement benefit plans as compared to $995 million in 2005. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, pension and postretirement health contributions to plan trusts in
2007 are projected to be approximately $581 million. In 2005, we received a $374 million tax refund associated with the 1985-1990 settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) reached previously, primarily on tax matters related to
excess value package insurance. In 2004, we received $610 million from a tax settlement with the IRS for tax years 1983-84 and 1991-98. Additionally, we expect to pay a total of $69 million between 2007 and 2008 related to employees who accepted a
recently-announced special voluntary separation opportunity, which is discussed further in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

On November 17, 2006, we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on January 1, 2007. We increased the base
rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS Ground. We also increased the base rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS
Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). We increased our Ground Hundredweight rates by an average of 5.9%. Other pricing changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and a $0.75 increase in the charge for
undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts. These rate changes are customary, and are consistent with previous years’ rate increases. Additionally, in January 2007 we will modify the fuel surcharge on domestic and U.S.-origin
international air services by reducing by 2% the index used to determine the fuel surcharge. The UPS Ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Rate changes for shipments
originating outside the U.S. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market.

Net Cash Used In Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $2.340 billion, $975 million, and $3.638 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The increased cash used in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to increased
capital expenditures and fewer net sales of marketable securities and short-term investments. During 2006, we


Index to Financial Statements

sold a net $482 million in marketable securities and short-term investments, primarily due to the pension and postretirement medical benefit plan fundings in
the third quarter. During 2005, we sold a net $2.752 billion in marketable securities and short-term investments, largely to fund the acquisition of Overnite as well as to make fundings to our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. In
2005, we spent $1.488 billion on business acquisitions, primarily Overnite Corp., Lynx Express Ltd. in the United Kingdom, Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in Poland, and the express operations of Sinotrans Air Transportation Development Co. Ltd. in
China (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). We generated cash of $68, $95, and $318 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively, due to the sales and customer paydowns of finance receivables, primarily in our leasing, asset-based
lending, and receivable factoring businesses.

In the second
quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash, which is reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows. These derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for
purchases of fuel products. As these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting, we anticipate that the gains associated with these hedges will be recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through
2007.

Capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in
investing activities, as follows (in millions):

As described in the
“Commitments” section below, we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We fund our capital expenditures
with our cash from operations.

Net Cash Used In Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $3.851, $4.175,
and $2.014 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Our primary uses of cash in financing activities have been to repurchase stock, pay dividends, and repay long-term debt. In July 2006, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.0
billion for future share repurchases, in addition to the amount remaining under our August 2005 share repurchase authorization. We repurchased a total of 32.6 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock for $2.455 billion in 2006
($2.460 billion reported on statement of cash flows due to timing of settlements), and 33.9 million shares for $2.479 billion in 2005. As of December 31, 2006, we had $936 million of our share repurchase authorization remaining; in
February 2007, the Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2.0 billion, which replaced the remaining amounts available under our July 2006 authorization. On February 8, 2007, our Board declared a dividend of
$0.42 per share, which is payable on March 6, 2007 to shareowners of record on February 20, 2007.

We increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.38 per share in 2006 from $0.33 per share in 2005, resulting in an increase in total cash dividends
paid to $1.577 billion from $1.391 billion. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects,
and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends.

Issuances of debt during 2006 consisted primarily of issuances of commercial paper, UPS Notes, and facility notes and bonds. Repayments of debt consisted
primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain equity-method partnerships. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio
and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt.


Index to Financial Statements

Sources of Credit

We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion in the United States. We had $791 million outstanding
under these programs as of December 31, 2006, with an average interest rate of 5.20%. The entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under
which we are authorized to borrow up to €1.0 billion in a variety of currencies. There were no amounts outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2006.

We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. These agreements provide revolving credit facilities of $1.0
billion each, with one expiring on April 19, 2007 and the other on April 21, 2010. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under either of
these agreements as of December 31, 2006.

In August 2003,
we filed a $2.0 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the United States. There was $136 million issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2006, all of which consists of issuances
under our UPS Notes program.

Our existing debt instruments and
credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. These covenants generally require us to maintain a $3.0 billion minimum net worth and
limit the amount of secured indebtedness available to the company. These covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company, and all covenant tests were satisfied as of December 31, 2006.

Commitments

We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase
commitments, and certain other liabilities. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2006 (in millions),
including the Boeing 767-300ER order discussed further below:

Our capital lease
obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft. These lease obligations and commitments, as well as our debt principal obligations, are discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The amount of interest on our debt was
calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed-rate debt, in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2006. The calculations of debt interest do not take into
account the effect of interest rate swap agreements.

Purchase
commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding, the largest of which are orders for aircraft, engines, and parts. We have firm commitments to purchase four Boeing MD-11 aircraft, and we expect to
take delivery of these aircraft during 2007. In February 2007, we announced an order for 27 Boeing 767-300ER freighters to be delivered between 2009 and 2012 (this order is


Index to Financial Statements

reflected in the purchase commitment numbers above). We also have firm commitments to purchase eight Boeing 747-400F aircraft scheduled for delivery during
2007 and 2008, and two Boeing 747-400BCF aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2008. These aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth.

In addition, we currently have a firm commitment to purchase 10 Airbus
A380-800 freighter aircraft and options to purchase 10 additional A380-800 aircraft (this order is reflected in the purchase commitment numbers above). In February 2007, we announced that we had signed an agreement with Airbus to set out a timetable
for deciding the status of this previous order. The agreement specifies changed delivery dates for the A380-800 and provides for possible termination of the original purchase agreement by either party later in 2007. The revised delivery schedule
specifies the delivery dates for the 10 Airbus A380-800’s on order as being between 2012 and 2013, whereas we were originally scheduled to take delivery of the Airbus A380-800 aircraft between 2009 and 2012. The signing of this agreement will
have no material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

The contractual payments due under the other liabilities column includes commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships. The commitments above exclude our planned pension and postretirement
benefit plan contributions, as we do not have any material funding requirements for our UPS-sponsored pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2006. In 2007, we plan to contribute $533 million to our U.S. pension and postretirement
benefit plans and $48 million to our international pension plans. Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute amounts annually that are at least equal to the amounts required by applicable laws and regulations, or to directly fund payments to
plan participants, as applicable. International pension plans will be funded in accordance with local regulations. We have also guaranteed our obligations for certain international pension plans up to a maximum amount of $118 million. See Note 5 to
the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans.

As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $2.213 billion issued in connection with routine business
requirements. As of December 31, 2006, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $604 million associated with our financial business.

We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected
long-term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, such as commitments for aircraft purchases, for the foreseeable future.

Contingencies

We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class-action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws.
In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and
attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,200 full-time supervisors. The court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS on all claims and plaintiffs have appealed. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims
and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

In another
case, Cornn v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they were improperly denied wages and/or overtime and meal and rest periods. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of
approximately 23,600 drivers and seek back wages, penalties, interest and attorneys’ fees. UPS has agreed in principle to settle this matter in full for a total payment of $87 million. On December 6, 2006, the court granted tentative approval
of the settlement.


Index to Financial Statements

We are named as a defendant in four putative class action lawsuits filed in federal courts, alleging a
conspiracy relating to certain surcharges by a number of air cargo carriers. We are not named as a defendant in at least eighty-six related cases that make similar allegations. These cases have been consolidated in a Multi- District Litigation
proceeding pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. UPS was not included as a defendant in the amended consolidated complaint on which the Multi-District Litigation is proceeding. In addition, in July 2006,
we were named as a defendant in a comparable lawsuit filed in the Ontario (Canada) Superior Court of Justice. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases.

We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual
resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

We participate in a number of trustee-managed multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining
agreements. Several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in demographics, and increased
benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity would result from our
participation in these plans.

As of December 31, 2006, we
had approximately 246,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”). These agreements run through
July 31, 2008. In the third quarter of 2006, we began formal negotiations with the Teamsters on a new agreement. We have approximately 2,800 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association
(“IPA”). On June 30, 2006, UPS and the IPA announced a tentative agreement on a new labor contract, which was ratified in the third quarter. This new contract becomes amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by
a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable on November 1, 2006. We began formal negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727 on October 2, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are
not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009.

Other Matters

On July 14, 2006, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice
(“DOJ”). The subpoena relates to the DOJ’s publicly-announced criminal investigation of the air cargo pricing practices of a number of domestic and foreign airlines. We do not believe that we are a target of this investigation and we
intend to cooperate.

With the assistance of outside counsel,
we investigated certain conduct within our Supply Chain Solutions subsidiary in certain locations outside the United States. Our investigation determined that certain conduct, which commenced prior to
our subsidiary’s 2001 acquisition of a freight forwarding business that was part of Fritz Companies Inc., may have violated the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The monetary value involved in this conduct appears
to be immaterial. We have implemented numerous remediation steps. We informed the SEC and the DOJ of our investigation, and we intend to cooperate fully with any review by the government of these issues. We do not believe that the results of this
investigation, the remediation or related penalties, if any, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, nor do we believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business
and prospects.

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices,
foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not


Index to Financial Statements

engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate,
equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps.

The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of
the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns,
models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel
fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled

.

A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and
further disclosures are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to an
increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products, primarily natural gas
and electricity, used in our operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative instruments generally cover
forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods of one to three years. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was an asset of $10 and $192 million,
respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $8 and $35 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities.

In the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash. These derivatives were designated as hedges of
forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products. As these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting, we anticipate that the gains associated with these hedges will be recognized in income over the original
term of the hedges through 2007.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue,
operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets,
liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow
currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset of
$30 and $52 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $183 and $65 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of
changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.


Index to Financial Statements

Interest Rate Risk

As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have issued debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that
accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix
of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of
the swaps match the terms of the associated debt.

Our floating
rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short-term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in short-term interest
rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at December 31, 2006 and 2005 would be approximately $29 million each year.

We have investments in debt and preferred equity securities (including auction rate securities), as well as cash-equivalent instruments, some of which
accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at December 31,
2006 and 2005 would be approximately $12 and $14 million, respectively.

Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. The potential change in the annual income resulting from a
hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at December 31, 2006 and 2005 would be immaterial.

This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate
changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our
interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions.

Equity Price Risk

We
hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of such investments was $80 and
$89 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $8 and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Credit Risk

The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an
element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established
credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R))” (“FAS
158”). This statement requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006.


Index to Financial Statements

FAS 158 also requires delayed recognition items, consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits, to be recognized in other
comprehensive income and subsequently amortized to the income statement. On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158. The effect of adopting FAS 158 on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 has
been included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, while there was no effect on our balance sheet for prior periods.

Additionally, we currently utilize the early measurement date option available under Statement No. 87 “Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions”, and we measure the funded status of our plans as of September 30 each year. Under the provisions of FAS 158, we will be required to use a December 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans
no later than 2008. We do not expect the impact of the change in measurement date to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109)”. This interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, financial statement classification, tax-related interest and penalties, and additional disclosure requirements. We are required to adopt this interpretation
effective January 1, 2007. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements. Any necessary transition adjustments will not affect net income in the period of adoption and will be reported as
a change in accounting principle in our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 was issued to
define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 is not anticipated to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

The adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a
material impact on our results of operations or financial condition:

•

FSP AUG AIR-1 “Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities”;

•

FAS 156 “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets”; and

•

FSP FAS 13-2 “Accounting for a Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Related to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction”.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial
statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on
prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are
applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.

Contingencies

— As discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and
contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“FAS 5”). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on
our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would
result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result.


Index to Financial Statements

The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable.
At the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our FAS 5 evaluation. We record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of FAS 5. These criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss
is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. Events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. These factors could result in a material
difference between estimated and actual operating results. Contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under FAS 5, excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below, were not material to the
Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2006. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of December 31, 2006, because a loss is not reasonably estimable.

Goodwill Impairment

— We account for goodwill in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units. Goodwill impairment testing
requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet.

We use a discounted cash flow model (DCF model) to estimate the fair value of our goodwill. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number
of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs and working capital changes. In addition, we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other
relevant variables, as required, in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions
for each of our reporting units.

As of December 31, 2006,
our recorded goodwill was $2.533 billion, of which $2.243 billion relates to our Supply Chain and Freight segment. This segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years, largely due to a number of acquisitions that we
have made. Because of its growth, this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies, resulting in higher volatility in our DCF model projections than for our other segments. Our annual impairment tests
performed in 2006, 2005 and 2004 resulted in no goodwill impairment.

Self-Insurance Accruals

—We self-insure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established
for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate
historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are
adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations.

Workers’ compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently,
actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in health care
costs and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. Changes in state legislation with respect to workers
compensation can affect the adequacy of our self-insurance accruals. All of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results.

We sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees.
We use estimates from third party actuaries to establish the liabilities for these plans. These liabilities and related expenses are based on


Index to Financial Statements

estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical
costs and inflation. Actual results may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results.

Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits

—As discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, we
maintain several defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” These assumptions include discount
rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods
and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries
and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. A 25 basis point change in the
assumed discount rate, expected return on assets, and health care cost trend rate for the pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases (decreases) on the Company’s costs and obligations for the year 2006 (in
millions):

Financial
Instruments

—As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 15 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the “Market Risk” section of this report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk. Certain of
these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other
relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations,
time value, credit spreads, and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. A
quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices is presented in the “Market Risk” section of this report.

Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets

—As
of December 31, 2006, we had $16.779 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we


Index to Financial Statements

make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of
the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets.

In
estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in
the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and
assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.

In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 144”), we review long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying
amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. We review long-lived assets for
impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. The circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change
in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different
air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business. Adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or
projected demand. This situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense).

During 2006, we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of
our Boeing 757, Boeing 767, and Airbus A300 fleets, and as a result of this evaluation, increased the depreciable lives from 20 to 30 years and reduced the residual values from 30% to 10% of original cost. This change did not have a material effect
on our results of operations.

In December 2004, we permanently
removed from service a number of Boeing 727, 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-8 aircraft. As a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft, we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a $110 million impairment charge
during the fourth quarter of 2004 for these aircraft (including the related engines and parts), $91 million of which impacted the U.S. domestic package segment and $19 million of which impacted the international package segment. This charge was
classified in the caption “other expenses” on the income statement. UPS continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow, and no impairments of aircraft were recognized in 2006 or 2005.

Income Taxes

—We operate in numerous countries
around the world and are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. We estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on statutory income tax rates in these jurisdictions and take into consideration items that are treated differently for
financial reporting and tax purposes. The process of estimating our effective income tax rate involves judgments related to tax planning and expectations regarding future events, including the impact of adjustments, if any, resulting from the
resolution of audits of open tax years by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities.

We recognize deferred tax assets for items that will generate tax deductions or credits in future years. Realization of deferred tax assets requires
sufficient future taxable income (subject to any carry-forward limitations) in the applicable jurisdictions. We make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets based, in part, on estimates of future taxable income. A valuation
allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not (likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Income tax related contingency
matters also affect our effective income tax rate. In this regard, we make judgments related to the identification and quantification of income tax related contingency matters.


Index to Financial Statements

During the third quarter of 2006, we recognized a $52 million reduction of income tax expense related to
favorable developments with certain U.S. Federal tax contingency matters involving non-U.S. operations.

During 2004, the resolution of tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities produced reductions in income tax expense of
$142 million.

Forward-Looking Statements

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” and other parts of this report contain “forward-looking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. The words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “we
see,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have
described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in
the forward-looking statements.

Risk Factors

The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to
differ materially from the expected results described in our forward-looking statements:

•

The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in
international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks.

•

The impact of competition on a local, regional, national, and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations,
various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business.

•

The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new
laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of September 11, 2001. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of
our authority to conduct our operations.

•

Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs, and customers may do more business with
competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also
may affect our competitive position and results of operations.

•

Possible disruption of supplies, or an increase in the prices, of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other
factors. We require significant quantities of fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products.

•

Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Board of Directors and Shareowners

United Parcel Service, Inc.

Atlanta, Georgia

We have
audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that United Parcel Service, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Shareowners

United Parcel Service, Inc.

Atlanta, Georgia

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Parcel
Service, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United Parcel Service, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on
January 1, 2006 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” and on December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)).”

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Financial
Statements and Business Activities

The accompanying
financial statements include the accounts of United Parcel Service, Inc., and all of its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively “UPS” or the “Company”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

UPS concentrates its operations in the field of transportation
services, primarily domestic and international letter and package delivery. Through our Supply Chain & Freight subsidiaries, we are also a global provider of specialized transportation, logistics, and financial services.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

U.S. Domestic and International Package Operations

—Revenue is recognized upon delivery of a letter or package, in accordance with EITF 91-9
“Revenue and Expense Recognition for Freight Services in Process”.

Forwarding and Logistics

—Freight forwarding revenue and the expense related to the transportation of freight is recognized at the time the services are performed in accordance with EITF 99-19
“Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent”. Material management and distribution revenue is recognized upon performance of the service provided. Customs brokerage revenue is recognized upon completing documents
necessary for customs entry purposes.

Freight

—Revenue is recognized upon delivery of a less-than-truckload (“LTL”) or truckload (“TL”) shipment, in accordance with EITF 91-9.

Financial Services

—Income on loans and direct finance leases is recognized on the effective interest method.
Accrual of interest income is suspended at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days delinquent. Income on operating leases is recognized on the straight-line method over the terms of
the underlying leases.

During 2006, we began classifying
deferred revenue and cost on our consolidated balance sheet as reductions of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued wages and withholdings. Previously, deferred revenue and cost had been included in other current liabilities and other
current assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We reclassified 2005 balance sheet line items for consistent presentation. This reclassification had the effect of reducing reported 2005 accounts receivable by $207 million, other current assets by
$68 million, accounts payable by $27 million, accrued wages and withholdings by $41 million, and other current liabilities by $207 million.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash. We consider securities with maturities of three
months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Marketable Securities and Short-Term Investments

Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with related unrealized gains and
losses reported, net of tax, as accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), a separate component of shareowners’ equity. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of

F-9

Index to Financial Statements

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion is included in investment income, along with interest and dividends. The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method; realized gains and losses resulting from such sales are included in investment income.

Investment securities are reviewed for impairment in accordance with FASB Statement No. 115 “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities” and FASB Staff Position (FSP) 115-1 “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.” We periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary
impairment considering many factors, including the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value has been less than its cost, overall economic and market conditions, and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer.
Impairment of investment securities results in a charge to income when a market decline below cost is other than temporary.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets, which are as follows: Vehicles—3 to 15 years; Aircraft—12 to 30 years; Buildings—20 to 40 years; Leasehold Improvements—terms of leases; Plant Equipment—6 to 10 years; Technology Equipment—3 to 5 years.
The costs of major airframe and engine overhauls, as well as routine maintenance and repairs, are charged to expense as incurred. During 2006, we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our Boeing 757, Boeing 767, and Airbus A300 fleets, and as
a result of this evaluation, increased the depreciable lives from 20 to 30 years and reduced the residual values from 30% to 10% of original cost. This change did not have a material effect on our results of operations.

Interest incurred during the construction period of certain property, plant
and equipment is capitalized until the underlying assets are placed in service, at which time amortization of the capitalized interest begins, straight-line, over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Capitalized interest was $48, $32,
and $25 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with the provisions of
FASB Statement No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we review long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the
undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or
external appraisals, as applicable. We review long-lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified.

In December 2004, we permanently removed from service a number of Boeing 727,
747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-8 aircraft. As a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft, we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a $110 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft
(including the related engines and parts), $91 million of which impacted the U.S. domestic package segment and $19 million of which impacted the international package segment.

This charge is included in the caption “Other expenses”. UPS continues to operate all of its other aircraft and
continues to experience positive cash flow, and no impairments of aircraft were recognized in 2006 or 2005.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Costs of purchased businesses in excess of net assets acquired (goodwill), and intangible assets are accounted for under the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”). Under FAS 142, we are required to test all goodwill for impairment at least annually, unless changes in circumstances indicate an
impairment may have occurred sooner. We are required to test goodwill on a “reporting unit” basis. A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, for businesses within that operating segment, discrete financial information is prepared
and regularly reviewed by management, in which case such a component business is the reporting unit.

A fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of
goodwill exceeds its fair value. Fair values are established using discounted cash flows. When available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples were used to corroborate discounted cash flow results. Our annual impairment tests performed in
2006, 2005, and 2004 resulted in no goodwill impairment.

Finite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, licenses, patents, customer lists, and franchise rights are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 2 to 20 years. Capitalized software is amortized
over periods ranging from 3 to 5 years.

Self-Insurance Accruals

We self-insure costs associated with workers’
compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as
estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost
per claim.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes” (“FAS 109”). FAS 109 is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, FAS 109 generally considers all expected future events other than proposed changes in the tax law or rates. Valuation allowances are provided if it is more
likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

We record accruals for tax contingencies related to potential assessments by tax authorities. Such accruals are based on management’s judgment and best estimate as to the ultimate outcome of any potential tax audits. Actual tax audit
results could vary from these estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

We translate the results of operations of our foreign
subsidiaries using average exchange rates during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of each period. Balance sheet currency translation adjustments are recorded in OCI. Net currency transaction
gains and losses included in other operating expenses were pre-tax gains (losses) of $(5), $(22), and $44 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS
123(R)”), which replaces FASB Statement No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. FAS 123(R) requires
all share-based awards to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be measured based on their fair values and expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting
period). We had previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the original FAS 123, prospectively for all new stock compensation awards granted to employees subsequent to January 1, 2003. FAS 123(R) was effective beginning with
the first interim or annual period after September 15, 2005; the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) deferred the effective date, and as a result, we adopted FAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the modified
prospective method. On that date, there were no unvested stock options or other forms of employee stock compensation issued prior to January 1, 2003, and thus all unvested stock-based awards were being expensed. A comparison of reported net
income and pro-forma net income (assuming all stock-based compensation was expensed in each year) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

We issue employee
share-based awards under the UPS Incentive Compensation Plan that are subject to specific vesting conditions; generally, the awards cliff vest or vest ratably over a five year period, “the nominal vesting period,” or at the date the
employee retires (as defined by the plan), if earlier. For awards that specify an employee vests in the award upon retirement, we account for the awards using the nominal vesting period approach. Under this approach, we record compensation expense
over the nominal vesting period. If the employee retires before the end of the nominal vesting period, any remaining unrecognized compensation expense is recorded at the date of retirement.

Upon our adoption of FAS 123(R), we revised our approach to apply the
non-substantive vesting period approach to all new share-based compensation awards. Under this approach, compensation cost is recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or over the period from the grant date to the
date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period. We continue to apply the nominal vesting period approach for any awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, and for the remaining portion of
the then unvested outstanding awards.

If we had accounted for
all share-based compensation awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 under the non-substantive vesting period approach, the impact to our net income and earnings per share would have been immaterial for all prior periods. The adoption of the
non-substantive vesting period approach reduced 2006 net income by $23 million, or $0.02 per diluted share.

Derivative Instruments

Derivative instruments are accounted for in accordance with FASB Statement No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS 133”), as amended, which requires all financial derivative instruments to be recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value
through income. If a derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in its fair value that are considered to be effective, as defined, either offset the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or
firm commitments through income, or are recorded in OCI until the hedged item is recorded in income. Any portion of a change in a derivative’s fair value that is considered to be ineffective, or is excluded from the measurement of
effectiveness, is recorded immediately in income.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued
Statement No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R))” (“FAS 158”). This statement requires the
recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. FAS 158 also requires delayed recognition terms,
consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits, to be recognized in other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized to the income statement. On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure
provisions of FAS 158. The effect of adopting FAS 158 on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 has been included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, while there was no effect on our balance sheet for prior periods.

Additionally, we currently utilize the early measurement date
option available under Statement No. 87 “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”, and we measure the funded status of our plans as of September 30 each year. Under the provisions of FAS 158, we will be required to use a
December 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans no later than 2008. We do not expect the impact of the change in measurement date to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109)”. This interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, financial statement classification, tax-related interest and penalties, and additional
disclosure requirements. We are required to adopt this interpretation effective January 1, 2007. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements. Any necessary transition adjustments will
not affect net income in the period of adoption and will be reported as a change in accounting principle in our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”), which is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 was issued to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 is not anticipated to have a material impact on our
results of operations or financial condition.

The adoption of
the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition:

•

FSP AUG AIR-1 “Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities”;

•

FAS 156 “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets”; and

•

FSP FAS 13-2 “Accounting for a Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Related to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction”.

NOTE 5. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

We sponsor various retirement and pension plans,
including defined benefit and defined contribution plans which cover our employees worldwide. In the U.S. we maintain the following defined benefit pension plans: UPS Retirement Plan, UPS Pension Plan, and several non-qualified plans including the
UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan. Effective January 1, 2006, the qualified defined benefit plans covering Overnite and Motor Cargo employees were merged with the UPS Retirement Plan and UPS Pension Plan.

We also sponsor various defined benefit plans covering certain of our
International employees. The majority of our International obligations are for defined benefit plans in Canada and the United Kingdom (including the Lynx acquisition in 2005). In addition, many of our International employees are covered by
government-sponsored retirement and pension plans. We are not directly responsible for providing benefits to participants of government-sponsored plans.

The UPS Retirement Plan is noncontributory and includes substantially all eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries who are not members of
a collective bargaining unit. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on average compensation levels earned by employees prior to retirement. Benefits payable under this plan are subject to maximum compensation limits and the
annual benefit limits for a tax qualified defined benefit plan as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service.

The UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to participants in the UPS Retirement Plan for amounts that exceed
the benefit limits described above.

The UPS Pension Plan is
noncontributory and includes certain eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries and members of collective bargaining units that elect to participate in the plan. This plan provides for retirement benefits based on service credits
earned by employees prior to retirement.

We also sponsor
postretirement medical plans in the U.S. that provide health care benefits to our retirees who meet certain eligibility requirements and who are not otherwise covered by multi-employer plans. Generally, this includes employees with at least 10 years
of service who have reached age 55 and employees who are eligible for postretirement medical benefits from a Company-sponsored plan pursuant to collective bargaining

agreements. We have the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans. These benefits have been provided to certain retirees on a noncontributory
basis; however, in many cases, retirees are required to contribute all or a portion of the total cost of the coverage.

On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158. FAS 158 required us to recognize the funded status of our
defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in our balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to AOCI, net of tax. The adoption of FAS 158 did not affect our operating results in the current period and will not have any effect in
future periods. We have presented below the incremental effects of adopting FAS 158 to our balance sheet for the individual line items impacted from this adoption, as of December 31, 2006 (in millions).

Net Periodic Benefit Cost

Actuarial Assumptions

The table below provides the weighted-average
actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost.

F-18

Index to Financial Statements

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The table below provides the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit
obligations of our plans.

Our pension and other
postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” These assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates, inflation,
rate of compensation increases, mortality rates, and other factors. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis.

A discount rate is used to determine the present value of our future benefit obligations. For U.S. plans, the discount rate is determined by matching the
expected cash flows to a yield curve based on long-term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date. For international plans, the discount rate is selected based on high quality fixed income indices available in
the country in which the plan is domiciled. These assumptions are updated each year.

An assumption for return on plan assets is used to determine the expected return on asset component of net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal year. This assumption for our U.S. plans was evaluated using input from
third-party consultants and various pension plan asset managers, including their long-term projection of returns for each asset class and our target allocation. For our U.S. plans, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is the foundation for all other
asset class returns, and various risk premiums are added to determine the expected return for each allocation.

For plans outside the U.S., consideration is given to local market expectations of long-term returns. Strategic asset allocations are determined by
country, based on the nature of liabilities and considering the demographic composition of the plan participants.

Health care cost trends are used to project future postretirement benefits payable from our plans. For year-end 2006 obligations, future postretirement
medical benefit costs were forecasted assuming an initial annual increase of 9.0%, decreasing to 5.0% by the year 2011 and with consistent annual increases at those ultimate levels thereafter.

Assumed health care cost trends have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for the U.S. postretirement medical plans. A one-percent change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (in millions):

Plan Asset Investment Policy

The asset allocation for our U.S. pension and other postretirement plans as of September 30, 2006 and 2005 and the
target allocation as of September 30, 2006, by asset category, are as follows:

Equity securities
include UPS Class A shares of common stock in the amounts of $440 (2.8% of total plan assets) and $423 million (3.4% of total plan assets), as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The applicable benefit plan committees establish investment guidelines and
strategies, and regularly monitor the performance of the funds and portfolio managers. Our investment strategy with respect to pension assets is to invest the assets in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The long-term primary
objectives for our pension assets are to (1) provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital, without undue exposure to risk; and protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power, and (2) provide investment results that
meet or exceed the plans’ actuarially assumed long-term rate of return.

Expected Cash Flows

Information about
expected cash flows for the pension and postretirement benefit plans is as follows (in millions):

Expected benefit
payments for pensions will be primarily paid from plan trusts. Expected benefit payments for postretirement benefits will be paid from plan trusts and corporate assets. Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute amounts annually that are at
least equal to the amounts required by applicable laws and regulations, or to directly fund payments to plan participants, as applicable. International plans will be funded in accordance with local regulations. We have also guaranteed our
obligations for certain international pension plans up to a maximum amount of $118 million. Additional discretionary contributions will be made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans.

Other Plans

We also contribute to several multi-employer pension plans for which the previous disclosure information is not determinable. Amounts charged to
operations for pension contributions to these multi-employer plans were $1.405, $1.234, and $1.111 billion during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

We also contribute to several multi-employer health and welfare plans that cover both active and retired employees for which the previous disclosure
information is not determinable. Amounts charged to operations for contributions to multi-employer health and welfare plans were $862, $798, and $761 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

We also sponsor a defined contribution plan for all employees not covered
under collective bargaining agreements. The Company matches, in shares of UPS common stock, a portion of the participating employees’ contributions. Matching contributions charged to expense were $113, $105, and $94 million for 2006, 2005, and
2004, respectively.

Contributions are also made to defined
contribution money purchase plans under certain collective bargaining agreements. Amounts charged to expense were $62, $55, and $52 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

NOTE 6. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The following table indicates the allocation of goodwill by reportable segment (in millions):

The goodwill acquired
in the International Package segment during 2006 resulted primarily from the purchase of the express operations of Sinotrans Air Transportation Development Co. Ltd. in China, offset by adjustments to the purchase price allocation of Lynx Express
Delivery Ltd. The decrease in goodwill for the Supply Chain & Freight segment during 2006 resulted primarily from finalizing the purchase price allocation of Overnite Corp. The goodwill acquired in the International Package segment during
2005 resulted primarily from the purchase of Lynx Express Delivery Ltd. in the United Kingdom, Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in Poland, and the express operations of Sinotrans Air Transportation Development Co. Ltd. in China. The goodwill acquired
in the Supply Chain & Freight segment in 2005 resulted primarily from the purchase of Overnite Corp., as well as purchase accounting adjustments resulting from the restructuring costs incurred in exiting certain activities from the Menlo
Worldwide Forwarding operations acquired previously (See Note 16 for further discussion of the restructuring). The currency / other balance includes the translation effect on goodwill from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, as well as escrow
reimbursements from acquisitions completed previously. See Note 7 for further discussion of these business acquisition transactions.

The following is a summary of intangible assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in millions):

Amortization of
intangible assets was $255, $255, and $221 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Expected amortization of finite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2006 for the next five years is as follows (in millions):
2007—$181; 2008—$131; 2009—$70; 2010—$24; 2011—$20. Amortization expense in future periods will be affected by business acquisitions, software development, and other factors.

NOTE 7. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

We regularly explore opportunities to make acquisitions that would enhance
our businesses. During the three years ended December 31, 2006, we completed several acquisitions, including both domestic and international transactions, which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. In connection with
these transactions, we paid cash (net of cash acquired) in the aggregate amount of $50 million, $1.488 billion, and $238 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented for any of the
acquisitions because the effects of these transactions were not material on either an individual or aggregate basis. The results of operations of each acquired company are included in our statements of consolidated income from the date of
acquisition. The purchase price allocations of acquired companies can be modified up to one year after the date of acquisition.

In March 2004, we acquired the remaining 49% minority interest in UPS Yamato Express Co., which was previously a joint venture with Yamato Transport Co.
in Japan, for $65 million in cash. UPS Yamato Express provides express package delivery services in Japan. Upon the close of the acquisition, UPS Yamato Express became a wholly-owned subsidiary of UPS, and is included in our International Package
reporting segment. The acquisition had no material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

In December 2004, we acquired Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, Inc. from CNF Inc. for $150 million in cash (net of cash acquired) plus the assumption of $110
million in principal amount of debt and capital lease obligations. Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, Inc. was a global freight forwarder that provided a full suite of heavy air freight forwarding services, ocean services and international trade
management, including customs brokerage. The former operations of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, Inc. are included as part of our Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment.

In December 2004, we agreed with Sinotrans Air Transportation Development Co., Ltd.
(“Sinotrans”) to acquire direct control of the international express operations in 23 cities within China, and to purchase Sintotrans’ interest in our current joint venture in China. As of December 31, 2006, we have made all cash
payments under the purchase agreement, a total of $114 million, and have taken direct control of operations in all 23 locations. The operations acquired are reported within our International Package reporting segment from the dates of acquisition.

In May 2005, we acquired Messenger Service Stolica S.A.
(“Stolica”), one of the leading parcel and express delivery companies in Poland. Stolica’s operating results are included in our International Package reporting segment from the date of acquisition.

In August 2005, we acquired Overnite Corporation (“Overnite”) for
approximately $1.225 billion in cash. Overnite offers a variety of LTL and TL services to more than 60,000 customers in North America. The operating results of Overnite, which is now known as UPS Freight, are included in our Supply Chain &
Freight reporting segment from the date of acquisition.

In
September 2005, we acquired Lynx Express Ltd. (“Lynx”) for approximately $68 million in cash. Lynx Express was one of the largest independent parcel carriers in the United Kingdom. Lynx also offers customers a broad suite of logistics and
spare parts logistics services. The operating results of Lynx are included in our International Package reporting segment from the date of acquisition.

NOTE 8. LONG-TERM DEBT AND COMMITMENTS

Long-term debt, as of December 31, consists of the following (in millions):

8.38% Debentures:

On January 22, 1998, we exchanged $276 million
of an original $700 million in debentures for new debentures of equal principal with a maturity of April 1, 2030. The new debentures have the same interest rate as the 8.38% debentures due 2020 until April 1, 2020, and, thereafter, the
interest rate will be 7.62% for the final 10 years. The 2030 debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at our option at any time. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount and accrued interest or the sum of the
present values of the remaining scheduled payout of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption at a benchmark treasury yield plus five basis points plus accrued interest. The remaining $424 million of 2020

F-26

Index to Financial Statements

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

debentures are not subject to redemption prior to maturity. Interest is payable semiannually on the first of April and October for both debentures and
neither debenture is subject to sinking fund requirements. The fixed obligations associated with the debentures are swapped to floating rates, based on six month LIBOR plus a spread. Including the effect of the swaps, the average interest rate paid
on the debentures for 2006 and 2005 was 8.00% and 7.39%, respectively.

Commercial Paper:

The weighted average
interest rate on the commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, was 5.20% and 4.01%, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the entire commercial paper balance has been classified as a current liability. The
amount of commercial paper outstanding in 2007 is expected to fluctuate. We are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion under the two U.S. commercial paper programs we maintain as of December 31, 2006. We also maintain a European commercial
paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €1.0 billion in a variety of currencies, however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2006.

Floating Rate Senior Notes:

The floating rate senior notes bear interest at one-month LIBOR less 45
basis points. The average interest rates for 2006 and 2005 were 4.66% and 2.87%, respectively. These notes are callable at various times after 30 years at a stated percentage of par value, and putable by the note holders at various times after 10
years at a stated percentage of par value. The notes have maturities ranging from 2049 through 2053.

Capital Lease Obligations:

We have certain aircraft subject to capital leases. Some of the obligations associated with these capital leases have been legally defeased. The recorded value of aircraft subject to capital leases, which are included
in Property, Plant and Equipment is as follows as of December 31 (in millions):

Facility Notes and Bonds:

We have
entered into agreements with certain municipalities to finance the construction of, or improvements to, facilities that support our U.S. Domestic Package and Supply Chain & Freight operations in the United States. These facilities are
located around airport properties in Louisville, KY; Dallas, TX; Philadelphia, PA; and Dayton, OH. Under these arrangements, we enter into a lease or loan agreement that covers the debt service obligations on the bonds issued by the municipalities,
as follows:

•

Bonds with a principal balance of $149 million issued by the Louisville Regional Airport Authority associated with our Worldport facility in Louisville, KY. The
bonds, which are due in January 2029, bear interest at a variable rate, and the average interest rates for 2006 and 2005 were 3.43% and 2.41%, respectively.

•

Bonds with a principal balance of $43 million issued by the Louisville Regional Airport Authority associated with our air freight facility in Louisville, KY. The
bonds were issued in November 2006 and are due in November 2036. The bonds bear interest at a variable rate, and the average interest rate from the time of issuance in November 2006 was 3.77%.

•

Bonds with a principal balance of $29 million issued by the Dallas / Forth Worth International Airport Facility Improvement Corporation associated with our Dallas,
TX airport facilities. The bonds are due in May 2032 and bear interest at a variable rate, however the variable cash flows on the obligation have been swapped to a fixed 5.11%.

•

Bonds with a principal balance of $100 million issued by the Delaware County, Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority associated with our Philadelphia, PA
airport facilities. The bonds, which are due in December 2015, bear interest at a variable rate, and the average interest rates for 2006 and 2005 were 3.34% and 2.21%, respectively.

•

Bonds with a principal balance of $108 million issued by the city of Dayton, OH associated with the Dayton airport facility, $62 million of which is due in 2009 and
the remaining $46 million is due in 2018. The balance due in 2018 is callable beginning in 2008. The bond principal due in 2018 bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.63%, while the bond principal due in 2009 bears interest at fixed rates ranging from
6.05% to 6.20%.

UPS Notes:

The UPS Notes program involves the periodic issuance of fixed rate notes in
$1,000 increments with various terms and maturities. At December 31, 2006, the coupon rates of the outstanding notes varied between 3.00% and 6.20%, and the interest payments are made either monthly, quarterly or semiannually. The maturities of
the notes range from 2008 to 2024. Substantially all of the fixed obligations associated with the notes were swapped to floating rates, based on different LIBOR indices plus or minus a spread. The average interest rate payable on the swaps for 2006
and 2005 was 4.73% and 3.09%, respectively.

Pound Sterling
Notes:

The Pound Sterling notes were issued in 2001
with a principal balance of £500 million, accrue interest at a 5.50% fixed rate, and are due on February 12, 2031.

Other Debt:

The other debt balance primarily relates to loans entered into in conjunction with our investment in various partnerships. Substantially all of this debt
is classified as a current liability. The implied interest rates on this debt range from 3.2% to 6.4%.

Other Information

Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for long-term debt with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt, including current maturities, is approximately $4.391 and 4.327 billion as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

We lease
certain aircraft, facilities, equipment and vehicles under operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2055. Certain of the leases contain escalation clauses and renewal or purchase options. Rent expense related to our operating leases
was $912, $843, and $759 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The following table sets forth the aggregate minimum lease payments under capital and operating
leases, the aggregate annual principal payments due under our long-term debt, and the aggregate amounts expected to be spent for purchase commitments (in millions).

As described in Note
18, we placed orders for 27 Boeing 767-300ER freighter aircraft in February 2007, which are scheduled to be delivered between 2009 and 2012. Additionally, also described in Note 18, we reached an agreement with Airbus in February 2007 to set out a
timetable for deciding the status of our previous order for the freighter version of the Airbus A380-800. We have included the purchase commitments associated with both the new Boeing 767-300ER order and the existing Airbus A380-800 order in the
purchase commitments information presented in the table above.

As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $2.213 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements.

We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks that provide revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion each,
with one expiring April 19, 2007 and the other April 21, 2010. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. At December 31, 2006, there were no outstanding borrowings
under these facilities.

We have a $2.0 billion shelf
registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the U.S. The debt may be denominated in a variety of currencies. There was approximately $136 million issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2006.

Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not
have cross-default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. These covenants generally require us to maintain a $3.0 billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of
secured indebtedness available to the company. These covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company, and all covenant tests were passed as of December 31, 2006.

NOTE 9. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES

We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts
containing various class-action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime,
and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class

F-29

Index to Financial Statements

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

of 1,200 full-time supervisors. The court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS on all claims and plaintiffs have appealed. We have denied any liability
with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

In another case, Cornn v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they were improperly denied wages and/or overtime and meal and rest periods. Plaintiffs purport to represent a
class of approximately 23,600 drivers and seek back wages, penalties, interest and attorneys’ fees. UPS has agreed in principle to settle this matter in full for a total payment of $87 million. On December 6, 2006, the court granted tentative
approval of the settlement.

We are named as a defendant in
four putative class action lawsuits filed in federal courts, alleging a conspiracy relating to certain surcharges by a number of air cargo carriers. We are not named as a defendant in at least eighty-six related cases that make similar allegations.
These cases have been consolidated in a Multi-District Litigation proceeding pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. UPS was not included as a defendant in the amended consolidated complaint on which the
Multi-District Litigation is proceeding. In addition, in July 2006, we were named as a defendant in a comparable lawsuit filed in the Ontario (Canada) Superior Court of Justice. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases.

We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course
of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

We participate in a number of trustee-managed multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered
under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in
demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or
liquidity would result from our participation in these plans.

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 246,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
(“Teamsters”). These agreements run through July 31, 2008. In the third quarter of 2006, we began formal negotiations with the Teamsters on a new agreement. We have approximately 2,800 pilots who are employed under a collective
bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association (“IPA”). On June 30, 2006, UPS and the IPA announced a tentative agreement on a new labor contract, which was ratified in the third quarter. This new contract becomes
amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable on November 1, 2006. We began formal negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727 on
October 2, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009.

NOTE 10.
SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY

Capital Stock, Additional Paid-In Capital,
and Retained Earnings

We maintain two classes of common
stock, which are distinguished from each other by their respective voting rights. Class A shares of UPS are entitled to 10 votes per share, whereas Class B shares are entitled to one

vote per share. Class A shares are primarily held by UPS employees and retirees, and these shares are fully convertible into Class B shares at any time.
Class B shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “UPS.” Class A and B shares both have a $0.01 par value, and as of December 31, 2006, there were 4.6 billion Class A shares and 5.6
billion Class B shares authorized to be issued. Additionally, there are 200 million preferred shares, with no par value, authorized to be issued; as of December 31, 2006, no preferred shares had been issued.

The following is a rollforward of our common stock, additional paid-in
capital, and retained earnings accounts (in millions, except per share amounts):

We repurchased a total
of 32.6 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock for $2.455 billion in 2006, and 33.9 million shares for $2.479 billion in 2005. As of December 31, 2006, we had $936 million of our share repurchase authorization
remaining. In February 2007, the Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2.0 billion, which replaces the remaining amount available under our July 2006 share repurchase authorization.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

We incur activity in AOCI for unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, foreign currency
translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses from derivatives that qualify as hedges of cash flows, and unrecognized pension and postretirement benefit costs. The activity in AOCI is as follows (in millions):

As discussed in Note
5, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158 on December 31, 2006. The adoption of FAS 158 required us to eliminate the previous minimum pension liability charge to AOCI, and to record a charge, net of tax, to AOCI
representing the unrecognized pension and postretirement benefit costs as of December 31, 2006.

Deferred Compensation Obligations and Treasury Stock

We maintain a deferred compensation plan whereby certain employees were previously able to elect to defer the gains on stock option exercises by deferring the shares received upon exercise into a rabbi trust. The
shares held in this trust are classified as treasury stock, and the liability to participating employees is classified as “deferred compensation obligations” in the shareowners’ equity section of the balance sheet. The amount of
shares needed to settle the liability for deferred compensation obligations is included in the denominator in both the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Employees are generally no longer able to defer the gains

from stock options vesting subsequent to April 2004. Activity in the deferred compensation program for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004
is as follows (in millions):

NOTE 11. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Incentive Compensation Plan

The UPS Incentive Compensation Plan permits the grant of nonqualified stock
options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units, and management incentive awards to eligible employees. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan is
112 million, with the number of shares reserved for issuance as restricted stock limited to 34 million. As of December 31, 2006, management incentive awards, stock options, restricted performance units, and restricted stock units had been
granted under the Incentive Compensation Plan.

Management Incentive
Awards & Restricted Stock Units

Persons earning
the right to receive management incentive awards are determined annually by the Compensation Committee of the UPS Board of Directors. Our management incentive awards program provides that half of the annual management incentive award, with certain
exceptions, be made in restricted stock units (“RSUs”), which generally vest over a five-year period. The other half of the award is in the form of cash or unrestricted shares of class A common stock and is fully vested at the time of
grant. These management incentive awards are generally granted in the fourth quarter of each year.

Upon vesting, RSUs result in the issuance of the equivalent number of UPS class A common shares after required tax withholdings. Except in the case of
death, disability, or retirement, RSUs granted for our management incentive awards generally vest over a five year period with approximately 20% of the award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant. The entire grant is expensed on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period. All RSUs granted are subject to earlier cancellation or vesting under certain conditions. Dividends earned on management incentive award RSUs are reinvested in additional RSUs at each dividend
payable date.

We also award RSUs in conjunction with our
long-term incentive performance awards program to certain eligible employees. The RSUs ultimately granted under the long-term incentive performance award will be based upon the achievement of certain performance measures, including growth in
consolidated revenue and operating return on invested capital, each year during the performance award cycle, and other measures, including growth in consolidated earnings, over the entire three year performance award cycle.

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

As of December 31, 2006, we had the following RSUs outstanding, including reinvested dividends:

The fair value of each
RSU is the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) closing price on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during 2006 and 2005 was $74.87 and $72.82, respectively. The total fair value of RSUs vested was
$82 million in 2006, and zero in 2005 and 2004. As of December 31, 2006, there was $437 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 4 years
and 5 months.

Nonqualified Stock Options

We maintain fixed stock option plans, under which options are granted to
purchase shares of UPS class A common stock. Stock options granted in connection with the Plan must have an exercise price at least equal to the NYSE closing price of UPS class B common stock on the date the option is granted.

Persons earning the right to receive stock options are determined each year
by the Compensation Committee. Except in the case of death, disability, or retirement, options granted under the Plan are generally exercisable three to five years from the date of grant and before the expiration of the option 10 years after the
date of grant. All options granted are subject to earlier cancellation or exercise under certain conditions. Option holders may exercise their options via the tender of cash or class A common stock, and new class A shares are issued upon exercise.
Options granted to eligible employees will generally be granted annually during the second quarter of each year at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.

The following is an analysis of options to purchase shares of class A common stock issued and outstanding:

are based on the historical returns on our stock and, due to our limited history of being a publicly-traded company, an index of peer companies, as well as the implied volatility of our publicly-traded options. The expected dividend yield is based
on the recent historical dividend yields for our stock, taking into account changes in dividend policy. The risk-free interest rate is based on the term structure of interest rates at the time of the option grant. The expected life represents an
estimate of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding, and we have relied upon a combination of the observed exercise behavior of our prior grants with similar characteristics, the vesting schedule of the grants, and an index of
peer companies with similar grant characteristics.

We received
cash of $30, $21, and $60 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, from option holders resulting from the exercise of stock options. We received a tax benefit of $12, $5, and $38 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, from the
exercise of stock options. The adoption of FAS 123(R) required us to change the statement of cash flow classification of these tax benefits, and as a result, these tax benefits are reported as cash from financing activities rather than cash from
operating activities.

The total intrinsic value of options
exercised during 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $45, $24, and $331 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, there was $80 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested options. That cost is expected to be recognized over
a weighted average period of 3 years and 4 months.

The
following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2006:

Restricted Performance Units

Beginning in 2003, we issued restricted performance units
(“RPUs”) under the Plan. Upon vesting, RPUs result in the issuance of the equivalent number of UPS class A common shares after required tax withholdings. Persons earning the right to receive RPUs are determined each year by the
Compensation Committee. Except in the case of death, disability, or retirement, RPUs vest five years after the date of grant. All RPUs granted are

F-35

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

subject to earlier cancellation or vesting under certain conditions. Dividends earned on RPUs are reinvested in additional restricted performance units at
each dividend payable date. RPUs also allow for an additional award equal to 10% of the outstanding RPUs to be issued if certain company-wide performance goals are attained in the year of vesting. RPUs granted to eligible employees will generally be
granted annually during the second quarter of each year at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.

As of December 31, 2006, we had the following RPUs outstanding, including reinvested dividends:

The fair value of each
RPU is the NYSE closing price on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant date fair value of RPUs granted during 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $80.88, $72.07, and $70.70, respectively. The total fair value of RPUs vested during 2006, 2005, and 2004
was $13, $13, and $11 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, there was $140 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RPUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years and
4 months.

Discounted Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We maintain an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees.
Under the plan, shares of UPS class A common stock may be purchased at quarterly intervals at 90% of the lower of the NYSE closing price of UPS class B common stock on the first or the last day of each quarterly period. Employees purchased 1.9, 2.0,
and 1.8 million shares at average prices of $66.64, $64.54, and $62.75 per share during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Compensation cost is measured for the fair value of employees’ purchase rights under our discounted employee stock
purchase plan using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The weighted average assumptions used and the calculated weighted average fair value of employees’ purchase rights granted, are as follows:

*

Includes the 10% discount from the market price.

Expected volatilities are based on the historical price volatility on our publicly-traded class B shares. The expected dividend yield is based on the
recent historical dividend yields for our stock, taking into account changes in dividend policy. The risk-free interest rate is based on the term structure of interest rates on U.S. Treasury securities at the time of the option grant. The expected
life represents the three month option period applicable to the purchase rights.

NOTE 12. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We report our operations in three segments: U.S. Domestic Package operations, International Package operations, and Supply
Chain & Freight operations. Package operations represent our most significant business and are broken down into regional operations around the world. Regional operations managers are responsible for both domestic and export operations
within their geographic area.

U.S. Domestic Package

Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters,
documents, and packages throughout the United States.

International Package

International Package operations include delivery to more
than 200 countries and territories worldwide, including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or distribution outside the United States. Our International Package reporting segment includes the
operations of our Europe, Asia, and Americas operating segments.

Supply
Chain & Freight

Supply Chain & Freight
includes our forwarding and logistics operations, UPS Freight, and other aggregated business units. Our forwarding and logistics business provides services in more than 175 countries and territories worldwide, and includes supply chain design and
management, freight distribution, customs brokerage, mail and consulting services. UPS Freight offers a variety of LTL and TL services to customers in North America. Other aggregated business units within this segment include Mail Boxes, Etc. (the
franchisor of Mail Boxes, Etc. and The UPS Store) and UPS Capital.

In evaluating financial performance, we focus on operating profit as a segment’s measure of profit or loss. Operating profit is before investment income, interest expense, and income taxes. The accounting policies of the reportable
segments are the same as those described in the summary of accounting policies (see Note 1), with certain expenses allocated between the segments using activity-based costing methods. Unallocated assets are comprised primarily of cash, marketable
securities, short-term investments, and equity-method real estate investments.

Segment information as of, and for the years ended, December 31 is as follows (in millions):

Revenue, for geographic disclosure, is based on the location in which service originates. Long-lived
assets include property, plant and equipment, pension and postretirement benefit assets, long-term investments, goodwill, and intangible assets.

NOTE 13. INCOME TAXES

The income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31 consists of the following (in millions):

Income before income
taxes includes income of non-U.S. subsidiaries of $490, $337, and $270 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31 consists of the following:

During the third
quarter of 2006, we recognized a $52 million reduction of income tax expense related to favorable developments with certain U.S. Federal tax contingency matters involving non-U.S. operations.

During the third quarter of 2004, we recognized a $99 million reduction of
income tax expense related to the favorable settlement of various U.S. federal tax contingency matters with the IRS pertaining to tax years 1985 through 1998, and various state and non-U.S. tax contingency matters.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recognized a $109 million reduction of
income tax expense primarily related to the favorable resolution of a U.S. state tax contingency matter, improvements in U.S. state and non-U.S. effective tax rates, and the reversal of valuation allowances associated with certain U.S.
state & local and non-U.S. net operating loss and credit carryforwards due to sufficient positive evidence that the related subsidiaries will be profitable and generate taxable income before such carryforwards expire.

F-39

Index to Financial Statements

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following at December 31 (in millions):

The valuation
allowance decreased by $11, $32, and $31 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, we have U.S. state & local operating loss and credit carryforwards of approximately $937 million and $54 million,
respectively. The operating loss carryforwards expire at varying dates through 2026. The majority of the credit carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely. We also have non-U.S. loss carryforwards of approximately $874 million as of
December 31, 2006, the majority of which may be carried forward indefinitely. As indicated in the table above, we have established a valuation allowance for certain non-U.S. and state loss carryforwards, due to the uncertainty resulting from a
lack of previous taxable income within the applicable tax jurisdictions.

Undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries amounted to approximately $1.225 billion at December 31, 2006. Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. federal or
state deferred income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes and withholding taxes payable in various non-U.S. jurisdictions, which could
potentially be offset by foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which provided for a temporary 85%
dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one-year period (expired in December 2005), did not have an impact on UPS as we did not repatriate any earnings subject to the Act.

NOTE 14. EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions except per share
amounts):

Diluted earnings per
share for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 exclude the effect of 6.3, 5.9, and 4.1 million shares, respectively, of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of employee stock options because such effect would be
antidilutive.

NOTE 15. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

We are exposed to market risk, primarily related to
foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and interest rates. These exposures are actively monitored by management. To manage the volatility relating to certain of these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative financial
instruments. Our objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and interest rates. It is our policy and
practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures. As we use price sensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of our existing and anticipated transactions, we expect that any loss in value for
those instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of those hedged transactions.

We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Commodity Price Risk Management

We are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally
jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline. Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products, principally natural gas and electricity. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide partial
protection from rising fuel and energy prices. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was an asset of $10 and $192 million, respectively. We have

F-41

Index to Financial Statements

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

designated and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges, and, therefore, the resulting gains and losses from these hedges are recognized as a
component of fuel expense or other occupancy expense when the underlying fuel or energy product being hedged is consumed.

In the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash, which is reported in other investing activities
in the statement of cash flows. These derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products. As these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting, we anticipate that the
gains associated with these hedges will be recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through 2007.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Management

We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in
which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro,
the British Pound Sterling, and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge currency cash flow exposures. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the net fair value of the hedging
instruments described above was an asset of $30 and $52 million, respectively. We have designated and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated revenue and, therefore, the resulting gains and losses
from these hedges are recognized as a component of international package revenue when the underlying sales occur.

Interest Rate Risk Management

Our indebtedness under our various financing arrangements creates interest rate risk. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest
rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are entered into concurrently with the
issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating rate debt.

We have designated and account for these contracts as either
hedges of the fair value of the associated debt instruments, or as hedges of the variability in expected future interest payments. Any periodic settlement payments are accrued monthly, as either a charge or credit to interest expense, and are not
material to net income. The net fair value of our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was a liability of $79 and $47 million, respectively.

Credit Risk Management

The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the
agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of
counterparty default.

Derivatives Not Designated As Hedges

Derivatives not designated as hedges primarily consist of a small
portfolio of stock warrants in public and private companies that are held for investment purposes. These warrants are recorded at fair value, and the impact of these warrants on our results was immaterial for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

F-42

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Income Effects of Derivatives

In the context of hedging relationships, “effectiveness” refers to the degree to which fair value changes in the
hedging instrument offset corresponding changes in the hedged item. Certain elements of hedge positions cannot qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133 whether effective or not, and must therefore be marked to market through income. Both the
effective and ineffective portions of gains and losses on hedges are reported in the income statement category related to the hedged exposure. Both the ineffective portion of hedge positions and the elements excluded from the measure of
effectiveness were immaterial for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

As of
December 31, 2006, $111 million in pre-tax gains related to cash flow hedges that are currently deferred in OCI are expected to be reclassified to income over the 12 month period ending December 31, 2007. The actual amounts that will be
reclassified to income over the next 12 months will vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. No amounts were reclassified to income during 2006 in connection with forecasted transactions that were no longer considered
probable of occurring.

At December 31, 2006, the maximum
term of derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions, except those related to cross-currency interest rate swaps on existing financial instruments, was 2 years. We maintain cross-currency interest rate swaps that extend through 2009.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, our financial instruments included cash
and cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments, accounts receivable, finance receivables, accounts payable, short-term and long-term borrowings, and commodity, interest rate, foreign currency, and equity options, forwards,
and swaps. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of our marketable securities and short-term
investments is disclosed in Note 2, finance receivables in Note 3, and debt instruments in Note 8.

NOTE 16. RESTRUCTURING COSTS

In connection with recent acquisitions and integration initiatives, we have incurred restructuring costs associated with the termination of employees, facility consolidations and other costs directly related to the restructuring initiatives
implemented. These costs have resulted from the integration of our Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Lynx acquisitions as well as restructuring activities associated with our Supply Chain Solutions operations. For specific restructuring costs
recognized in conjunction with the cost from acquisitions, we have accounted for these costs in accordance with EITF 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities Assumed in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination.” All other restructuring
costs have been accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” and SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”

Menlo Worldwide Forwarding

In February 2005, we announced our intention to transfer the heavy
air freight operations at our facility in Dayton, Ohio (acquired with the operations of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding in December 2004) to other UPS facilities over approximately 12 to 18 months. This action was taken to remove redundancies
between the Dayton air freight facility and existing UPS transportation networks, and thus provide efficiencies and better leverage the current UPS infrastructure in the movement of air freight. During the third quarter of 2005, we finalized our
plans to exit the Dayton facility, as well as various other acquired facilities, and accrued certain costs related to employee severance, lease terminations, and related items. As part of this restructuring program, the recorded

F-43

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

value of the Dayton facility was reduced to its fair market value as of the date of the acquisition. These accrued costs, and related reductions in the fair
value of recorded assets, resulted in an adjustment of $160 million to the amount of goodwill initially recorded in the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding acquisition.

Additionally, we incurred costs related to integration activities, such as employee relocations, the moving of inventory and fixed assets, and the
consolidation of information systems, and these amounts were expensed as incurred. We completed the majority of our integration activities for the air freight restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2006. The remaining restructuring
liabilities existing as of December 31, 2006, primarily represent costs that will continue to be incurred under various long-term contracts without any economic benefit to our Company.

Set forth below is a summary of activity related to the air freight
restructuring program and resulting liability for the year ended December 31, 2006 (in millions):

Employee severance
costs related to severance packages for approximately 550 people. These packages were involuntary and were formula-driven based on salary levels and past service. The separations spanned the entire business unit, including the operations,
information technology, finance, and business development functions.

Asset impairment charges resulted from establishing new carrying values for assets which were abandoned. Impaired assets consisted primarily of the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding facility in Dayton, Ohio, which we closed in June 2006.

Facility consolidation costs are associated with terminating
operating leases on offices, warehouses, and other acquired facilities as well as other maintenance costs associated with certain facilities.

Other costs consist primarily of costs associated with the termination of certain acquired legal entities and joint ventures, as well as environmental
remediation costs.

Lynx Express Ltd.

In conjunction with our integration of the Lynx business, we have
implemented a series of initiatives to reduce operating costs and maximize the efficiencies of the UPS network in the United Kingdom. These initiatives include closing existing hubs and constructing a consolidated sorting facility as well as
establishing a European shared service center in Poland. As a result of these initiatives, we have accrued certain costs related to employee severance, lease terminations and other facility costs as well as recorded a reduction in the fair value of

F-44

Index to Financial Statements

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

certain assets acquired. These restructuring costs impacting the acquired Lynx business have resulted in an adjustment to goodwill of $7 million. The
remaining integration costs for this restructuring program, including facility costs associated with capacity expansion, will be recognized as incurred. We anticipate completing this integration program by fiscal year 2008 at which time certain hubs
will be closed and the new consolidated sorting facility will be fully operational.

Supply Chain Solutions

In an effort to
rationalize our cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth, we initiated a restructuring plan for our Supply Chain Solutions Forwarding & Logistics operations in the fourth quarter of 2006. This restructuring plan is expected to
generate efficiencies resulting in improved revenues and operating profits by further integrating all of our transportation services to better serve our customers. This restructuring involves plans to reduce non-operating expenses by approximately
20%, including a reduction in non-operating staff of approximately 1,400 people. As of December 31, 2006, $12 million in costs have been accrued related to employee severance.

UPS Special Voluntary Separation Opportunity

In December 2006, we offered a special voluntary separation opportunity (“SVSO”) to approximately 640 employees
who work in non-operating functions. This program is an effort to improve the efficiency of non-operating processes by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company. The SVSO ended in February 2007, and approximately 30% of
eligible employees accepted the offer. As a result, we will record a charge to expense of approximately $80 million in the first quarter of 2007, to reflect the anticipated cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree
healthcare benefits under the SVSO program.

NOTE 18. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In February 2007, we announced an order for 27 Boeing 767-300ER freighters to be delivered between 2009 and 2012. We
anticipate using these 767-300ER aircraft primarily to support the growth in our International Package business, and to improve the efficiency and speed of our air network as we eventually replace aging aircraft.

In February 2007, we signed an agreement with Airbus to set out a timetable
for deciding the status of our previous order for the freighter version of the Airbus A380-800. The agreement specifies changed delivery dates for the A380-800 and provides for possible termination of the original purchase agreement by either party
later in 2007. The revised delivery schedule specifies the delivery dates for the 10 Airbus A380-800’s on order as being between 2012 and 2013, whereas we were originally scheduled to take delivery of the Airbus A380-800 aircraft between 2009
and 2012. The signing of this agreement will have no material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

In conjunction with these changes, we have initiated a re-evaluation process of our aircraft fleet types, to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of
aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses. This process might result in the planned retirement of certain less-efficient and older aircraft models at dates earlier than originally anticipated. As a result, we will
reassess our assumptions of the expected lives and residual values on these aircraft. Any resulting adjustments would be accounted for on a prospective basis, potentially resulting in increased depreciation expense in future periods. Additionally,
this process could result in circumstances that would indicate the net book value of the aircraft might not be recoverable, based on the undiscounted future cash flows the aircraft are anticipated to generate. If the net book value of the aircraft
is determined not to be recoverable, we would be required to record an impairment based on the fair value of the aircraft, in accordance with FAS 144. We anticipate completing this process by the end of the first quarter of 2007.
