UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008



PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

United Parcel Service, Inc. (“UPS”) is the world’s largest package
delivery company, a leader in the U.S. less-than-truckload industry, and a global leader in supply chain management. We were founded in 1907 as a private messenger and delivery service in Seattle, Washington. Today, we deliver packages each business
day for 1.8 million shipping customers to 6.1 million consignees in over 200 countries and territories. In 2008, we delivered an average of 15.5 million pieces per day worldwide, or a total of 3.92 billion packages. Total revenue in
2008 was $51.5 billion.

Our primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages and documents worldwide. In recent years, we have
extended our service portfolio to include global supply chain services and less-than-truckload transportation, primarily in the U.S. We report our operations in three segments: U.S. Domestic Package operations, International Package operations, and
Supply Chain & Freight operations.

•

U.S. Domestic Package.

U.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents, and packages throughout the United States.

•

International Package.

International Package operations include delivery to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, including shipments wholly
outside the United States, as well as shipments from or to the United States with another country as the destination or origin point.

•

Supply Chain & Freight.

Supply Chain & Freight includes our forwarding and logistics operations, UPS Freight, and other related business
units. Our forwarding and logistics business provides services in more than 175 countries and territories worldwide, and includes supply chain design and management, freight distribution, customs brokerage, mail and consulting services. UPS Freight
offers a variety of less-than-truckload (“LTL”) and truckload (“TL”) services to customers in North America. Other business units within this segment include Mail Boxes, Etc. (the franchisor of Mail Boxes, Etc. and The UPS Store)
and UPS Capital.

Transportation and Infrastructure.

We operate a ground fleet of
approximately 107,000 vehicles, which reaches all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous U.S. We also operate an air fleet of about 570 aircraft, the ninth largest airline in the world. Our primary air hub is in Louisville, KY.
Regional air hubs are located in Columbia, SC; Dallas, TX; Hartford, CT; Ontario, CA; Philadelphia, PA; and Rockford, IL. Our largest international air hub is in Cologne, Germany, with other regional international hubs in Miami, FL; Canada; Hong
Kong; Singapore; Taiwan; China; and the Philippines.

We have established a global transportation infrastructure and a comprehensive
portfolio of services. We support these services with advanced operational and customer-facing technology. Our supply chain solutions enable customers’ inventory to move more effectively. As a consequence, they can concentrate on their own core
competencies.

Outlook.

We believe that the following trends will allow us to continue to grow our business
over the long term:

•

Globalization of trade is a worldwide economic reality, which will continue to expand as trade barriers are eliminated and large consumer markets, in particular
China, India and Europe, experience economic growth.

•

To be effective, just-in-time inventory management, increased use of the Internet for ordering goods, and direct-to-consumer business models require transportation
services.

•

Outsourcing supply chain management is becoming more prevalent, as customers increasingly view effective management of their supply chains as a strategic advantage
rather than a cost center.



Our vision for the future is to synchronize the world of commerce, addressing the complexities of our
customers’ supply chain needs. Our goal is to develop business solutions that create value and competitive advantages for our customers, enabling them to achieve supply chain efficiencies, better customer service for

their

customers and
improved cash flow.

Operations

We believe that our integrated global network is the most extensive in the industry. It is the only network that handles all levels of service (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial, residential) through
one integrated pickup and delivery service system.

U.S. Domestic Package

The U.S. business consists of air and ground delivery of small packages—up to 150 pounds in weight—and letters to and from all 50 states. It
also provides guaranteed, time-definite delivery of certain heavy-weight packages. Substantially all of our U.S. small package delivery services are guaranteed.

This business is built on an integrated air and ground pick-up and delivery network. We believe that this model improves productivity and asset utilization, and provides the flexibility to transport packages using the
most reliable and cost-effective transportation mode or combination of modes.

In 2006, we made the most significant upgrade ever to our
U.S. ground package delivery network, accelerating the transit times for more than a half-million packages nationwide by one day or more. Additional lane enhancements were introduced in February 2008.

We believe that our broad product portfolio, reliable package delivery service, experienced and dedicated employees and unmatched, integrated air and
ground network provide us with the advantages of reputation, service quality and economies of scale that differentiate us from our competitors. Our strategy is to increase domestic revenue through cross-selling services to our large and diverse
customer base, to control costs through effective network modification and limited expense growth, and to employ technology-driven efficiencies to increase operating profit.

International Package

The International Package segment provides air and ground delivery of small
packages and letters to more than 200 countries and territories around the world. Export services cross country boundaries; domestic services move shipments within a country’s borders. UPS’s global presence grew out of its highly refined
U.S. domestic business.

•

Europe is our largest region outside the United States—accounting for approximately half of our international revenue. In Europe we provide both express and
domestic service, much like the service portfolio we offer in the U.S., and based on the same integrated network.

•

Through more than two dozen alliances with Asian delivery companies that supplement company-owned operations, we serve more than 40 Asia Pacific countries and
territories. Two of the fastest growing economies in the world, China and India, are among our most promising opportunities.

•

Our Canadian operations include both domestic and import/export capabilities. We deliver to all addresses throughout Canada.

•

We are also the largest air cargo carrier in Latin America and the Caribbean.

We have built a strong international presence through significant investments over several decades. Some of our recent acquisitions and investments
include the following:

•

In 2006, to capitalize on growth opportunities across the whole of Europe, we completed the expansion of our automated package sorting hub at the Cologne/Bonn
airport in Germany. The expansion doubled



the hub’s sorting capacity to 110,000 packages per hour, largely through the use of new automation technology.

•

In 2007, we implemented the largest service expansion of our international shipping portfolio in more than a decade. UPS began offering customers three, rather than
two, daily time-definite delivery options to and from the world’s most active trading markets, giving customers greater flexibility in managing their businesses.

•

In 2008, we completed construction of a new hub in Tamworth, England, UPS’s largest ground hub outside the U.S. It replaces three smaller facilities, and adds
more capacity and better efficiencies than existed with the three separate facilities.

•

Also in 2008, we acquired our partner’s interest in the small package joint venture operation in Romania.

Growth in Asia is being driven by global demand, which is stimulating improved demographic and economic trends throughout the region, particularly in
China and India. Over the last few years UPS has steadily increased air service between the U.S. and Asia.

•

In 2006, we added three additional daily flights between Shanghai, China and the U.S., and another new flight between Qingdao, China and Incheon, Korea. We also
began direct air service between Shanghai and Cologne. Those flights support international express volume into and out of China, which has seen dramatic growth in recent years.

•

In 2007, we added six daily flights between the U.S. and Nagoya, Japan. This new service complements our 78 weekly flights into and out of Tokyo and Osaka, Japan.
These flights connected to Shanghai in 2008, enhancing intra-Asia service.

•

In 2008, we opened a new air hub in Shanghai, the first constructed in China by a U.S. carrier. It links all of China via Shanghai to UPS’s international
network with direct service to the Americas, Europe and Asia. It also connects points served in China by UPS.

•

Also in 2008, we broke ground on a new intra-Asia air hub in Shenzhen, China, which is expected to be operational in 2010. We also acquired our partner’s
interest in a small package shipping joint venture in Korea.

The international package delivery market has been growing
at a faster rate than that of the U.S., and our international package operations have historically been growing faster than the market. We plan to use our worldwide infrastructure and broad product portfolio to grow high-margin premium services. We
will also implement cost, process and technology improvements in our international operations. We believe that both Europe and Asia offer significant opportunities for long-term growth.

Supply Chain & Freight Segment

The Supply Chain & Freight segment consists of our
forwarding and logistics capabilities as well as our UPS freight business unit.

In today’s global economy, companies’ supply
chains are growing increasingly complex, as shown in Diagram 1 below. Many of our customers, large and small, have outsourced all or part of their supply chains to streamline and gain efficiencies, to improve service, to support new business models
and to strengthen their balance sheets.



This increasing complexity creates demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation,
distribution and international trade services with financial and information services. We believe that we can capitalize on this opportunity because:

•

We manage supply chains in over 175 countries and territories, with about 35 million square feet of distribution space worldwide.

•

We focus on supply chain optimization, freight forwarding, international trade services and management-based solutions for our customers rather than solely on more
traditional asset-based logistics such as warehouses and vehicle fleets.

•

We provide a broad range of transportation solutions to customers worldwide, including air, ocean and ground freight, as well as customs brokerage, and trade and
materials management.

•

We provide service, information technology systems and distribution facilities adapted to the unique supply chains of specific industries such as healthcare,
technology, and consumer/retail. We call this “configurable solutions.” In a configurable solution, multiple customers share standardized IT systems and processes as well as a common network of assets. A configurable solution is repeatable
for multiple customers and has a package transportation component.

•

We offer a portfolio of financial services that provides customers with short-term and long-term financing, secured lending, working capital, government guaranteed
lending, letters of credit, global trade financing, credit cards and equipment leasing.

UPS Freight is an LTL service,
which offers a full range of regional, inter-regional and long-haul LTL capabilities in all 50 states, Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and Mexico. This business also offers a TL service.

Our growth strategy is to increase the number of customers benefiting from repeatable supply chain solutions, particularly in the healthcare, high tech
and retail sectors, and to increase the amount of small package transportation from these customers. We intend to leverage our small package and freight customers through cross-selling the full complement of UPS services.



Products and Services

Our goal is to provide our customers with easy-to-use products and services. We seek to streamline their shipment processing and integrate critical
transportation information into their own business processes, helping them create supply chain efficiencies, better serve their customers and improve their cash flows. These products and services support LTL and air freight shipments, as well as
small package transportation. UPS offers a variety of technology solutions for automated shipping, visibility and billing. We believe we have the most comprehensive suite of such services in the industry.

Global Small Package.

Our global small package portfolio consists of a spectrum of export and domestic services. Export
services are those provided for packages crossing a country’s borders, while domestic services are for packages that stay within the borders of a single country. We provide domestic services in 23 major countries outside the United States. This
portfolio includes guaranteed delivery options to major cities around the world. We handle packages that weigh up to 150 pounds and are up to 165 inches in combined length and girth. We offer same-day pickup of air and ground packages. We also offer
worldwide customs clearance service for any mode of transportation.

Additional products that provide enhanced shipping, visibility,
billing and returns services are available to customers who require customized package solutions.

Our enhanced, data-driven package
pick-up and delivery technology is the basis for new services introduced in 2007. For example, UPS introduced a unique paperless invoice service for international small package shippers that integrates order processing, shipment preparation and
commercial invoice data and then transmits that data to customs offices across the globe, eliminating the need for paper commercial invoices. Another new offering, UPS Returns, is the first industry offering that facilitates international commerce
for any size customer by simplifying package returns to 98 countries or territories. Package recipients can obtain international return labels and commercial invoices via e-mail, local post or from a UPS driver picking up the return package.

We provide our customers with easy access to UPS. There are almost 150,000 domestic
and international access points to UPS. These include: 38,800 branded drop-boxes, 1,000 UPS Customer Centers, 6,000 independently owned and operated The UPS Store

®

and Mail Boxes Etc.

®

locations worldwide, 2,800 alliance partner locations, 13,200 Authorized Shipping Outlets and commercial counters, and 87,000 UPS drivers who can accept packages given to them.

.    Our freight forwarding and logistics businesses meet customers’ supply chain needs through a
comprehensive portfolio of services, including:

•

•

UPS Capital

SM

provides asset-based lending, global trade finance and export-import lending services.

In 2008, UPS launched a
new, simplified global portfolio for shipping air freight, with guaranteed day-specific, door-to-door service as well as non-guaranteed service options.



Freight Services.

UPS Freight provides LTL services through a network of
owned and leased service centers and carrier partnerships. UPS Freight also provides our customers with truckload and dedicated truckload transportation solutions. Since expanding into the freight transport market, we have enhanced our value
proposition through improvements in technology, operations and the customer experience. In 2007, we integrated all freight products, into our small package visibility systems, enabling shippers to view the status of package and freight shipments
from a single web page. Since mid-2007, UPS Freight has accelerated transit times on over 12,000 lanes. Significant service and reliability improvements for freight transportation enabled us to implement a no-fee, guaranteed delivery service in
early 2008 and expand it to Canadian deliveries later in the year.

Technology

Technology is the backbone of everything we do at UPS. It is at the heart of customer access to the company.

•

UPS.com

processes over 18 million package tracking transactions daily. A growing number of those tracking requests now come from customers in countries
that have wireless access to UPS tracking information.

•

Package tracking, pickup requests, rate quotes, account opening, wireless registration, drop-off locator, transit times and supply ordering services are all
available at customers’ desktops or laptops. The site also displays full domestic and international service information and allows customers to process outbound shipments as well as return labels for their customers.

•

Businesses in a number of countries also can download UPS

OnLine Tools SM

to their own websites for direct use by their customers. This allows users to
access the information they need without leaving our customers’ websites.

•

In 2007, we integrated all freight products, including international air freight forwarding shipments, into our small package visibility systems. Now a shipper can
view the status of package and freight shipments from a single web page.

Technology is also the foundation for process
improvements within UPS that enhance productivity, improve efficiency and reduce costs. The most comprehensive improvement to our U.S. small package handling facilities was completed in 2007. This multi-year effort re-engineered our domestic
business, based on a data-driven platform, and included software, hardware and process changes. It enables a package center to produce an optimized dispatch plan for every driver and detailed loading instructions for every vehicle before center
employees handle any packages. This plan reduces mileage driven, resulting in substantial savings in fuel usage. The re-engineered system provides the basis for unique customer-focused services based on the customer-specific data which powers the
system.

In 2008, we began deploying Telematics, a technology that combines information from our drivers’ hand-held computers with GPS
and automotive sensors to help us better manage our ground fleet operations. It will help us to improve vehicle maintenance, enhance safety and fine-tune delivery and pick-up service. This technology will also help us improve on-road performance by
reducing vehicle expense, fuel consumption, and carbon emissions. In 2008, we equipped 3,226 of our U.S. vehicles with the sensors needed to achieve the benefits from this technology.

Sustainability

UPS takes seriously its commitment to operate in a socially, environmentally and
economically sustainable manner. In 2003, the company was the first in its industry to publish a sustainability report that set forth its five-year goals – and then to provide annual updates on progress toward attaining those goals. The website

sustainability.ups.com

provides complete information on these efforts.



UPS constantly reviews our processes, programs and policies to ensure we are operating in a sustainable
and responsible manner that benefits all our stakeholders—customers, employees, shareowners and the communities in which we operate. Multiple recognitions in 2008 attest to our success, such as:

•

Included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the sixth consecutive year and the FTSE4Good Index for the fourth consecutive year,

•

Listed in the top tier of the World’s Most Respected Companies by the Reputation Institute,

•

Named as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Magazine,

Received the Corporation of the Year award from the National Minority Supplier Development Council,

•

UPS Supply Chain Solutions ranked among top “Green” Outsourcers,

•

Ranked No. 11 in

Barron’s

World’s Most Respected Companies.

Sales and Marketing

The UPS worldwide sales organization is responsible for
the complete spectrum of UPS products and services. This field sales organization consists primarily of locally based account executives assigned to our individual operating units. For our largest multi-shipping-site customers, we manage sales
through an organization of regionally based account managers, reporting directly to executive management.

Our sales force also includes
specialized groups that work with our general sales organization to support the sale of customer technology solutions, international package delivery, LTL and freight transportation, and warehousing and distribution services.

In 2007, we completed a major sales force reorganization to better align our sales resources and integrate with customer business processes. Our goal is
to enhance the customer experience when dealing with the extensive scope of UPS capabilities, at any point in the shipping or supply chain management process.

Our worldwide marketing organization also supports global small package and our supply chain and freight businesses. Our corporate marketing function is engaged in market and customer research, brand management,
rate-making and revenue management policy, new product development, product portfolio management, marketing alliances and e-commerce, including the non-technical aspects of our web presence. Advertising, public relations, and most formal marketing
communications are centrally developed and controlled.

In addition to our corporate marketing group, field-based marketing personnel are
assigned to our individual operating units and are primarily engaged in business planning, bid preparation and revenue management activities. These local marketing teams support the execution of corporate initiatives while also managing limited
promotional and public relations activities pertinent to their local markets.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 426,000 employees.

Approximately 260,000 of our employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
(“Teamsters”). These agreements run through July 31, 2013.



We have approximately 2,900 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the
Independent Pilots Association (“IPA”). The current contract becomes amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable on November 1,
2006. We began formal negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727 in October 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (approximately 3,000). These agreements run through July 31, 2009.

We
believe that our relations with our employees are good. We survey all our employees to determine their level of job satisfaction. Areas of concern receive management attention as we strive to keep UPS the employer of choice among our employees.

We consistently receive numerous awards and wide recognition as an employer-of-choice, resulting in part from our emphasis on diversity
and corporate citizenship.

Competition

We are the largest package delivery company in the world, in terms of both revenue and volume. We offer a broad array of services in the package and freight delivery industry and, therefore, compete with many
different local, regional, national and international companies. Our competitors include worldwide postal services, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Through our supply chain service offerings,
we compete with a number of participants in the supply chain, financial services and information technology industries.

Competitive Strengths

Our competitive strengths include:

Integrated Global Network.

We believe that our integrated global ground and air network is the most extensive in the
industry. It is the only network that handles all levels of service (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial, residential) through a single pickup and delivery service system.

Our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily basis. This unique, integrated global
business model creates consistent and superior returns.

We believe we have the most comprehensive integrated delivery and information
services portfolio of any carrier in Europe. In other regions of the world, we rely on both our own and local service providers’ capabilities to meet our service commitments.

Leading-edge Technology.

We are a global leader in developing technology that helps our customers optimize their shipping
and logistics business processes to lower costs, improve service and increase efficiency.

Technology powers virtually every service we
offer and every operation we perform. Our technology initiatives are driven by our customers’ needs. We offer a variety of on-line service options that enable our customers to integrate UPS functionality into their own businesses not only to
conveniently send, manage and track their shipments, but to provide their customers with better information services. We provide the infrastructure for an Internet presence that extends to tens of thousands of customers who have integrated UPS tools
directly into their own web sites.

Broad Portfolio of Services.

Our portfolio of services enables customers
to choose the delivery option that is most appropriate for their requirements. Increasingly, our customers benefit from business solutions that integrate many UPS services in addition to package delivery. For example, our supply chain
services—such as freight forwarding, customs brokerage, order fulfillment, and returns management—help improve the efficiency of the supply chain management process.



Customer Relationships.

We focus on building and maintaining long-term
customer relationships. We serve 1.8 million pick-up customers and 6.1 million delivery customers daily. Cross-selling small package, supply chain and freight services across our customer base is an important growth mechanism for UPS.

Brand Equity.

We have built a leading and trusted brand in our industry—a brand that stands for quality
service, reliability and product innovation. The distinctive appearance of our vehicles and the friendliness and helpfulness of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity.

Distinctive Culture.

We believe that the dedication of our employees results in large part from our distinctive
“employee-owner” concept. Our employee stock ownership tradition dates from 1927, when our founders, who believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business, first offered stock to employees. To facilitate
employee stock ownership, we maintain several stock-based compensation programs.

Our long-standing policy of “promotion from
within” complements our tradition of employee ownership, and this policy reduces the need for us to hire managers and executive officers from outside UPS. The majority of our management team began their careers as full-time or part-time hourly
UPS employees, and have spent their entire careers with us. Many of our executive officers have more than 30 years of service with UPS and have accumulated a meaningful ownership stake in our company. Therefore, our executive officers have a strong
incentive to effectively manage UPS, which benefits all our shareowners.

Financial Strength.

Our balance
sheet reflects financial strength that few companies can match. As of December 31, 2008, we had a balance of cash and marketable securities of approximately $1.049 billion and shareowners’ equity of $6.780 billion. As of December 31, 2008,
our Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) short-term credit ratings were P-1 and A-1+, respectively, and our Moody’s and S&P long-term credit ratings were Aa2 and AA-, respectively, with a stable outlook
from both of these credit rating agencies. This reflects our strong capacity to service our obligations. Our financial strength gives us the resources to achieve global scale; to invest in technology, transportation equipment and buildings; to
pursue strategic opportunities that facilitate our growth; and to return value to our shareowners in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

Government Regulation

Air Operations

The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), have
regulatory authority over United Parcel Service Co.’s (“UPS Airlines’”) air transportation services. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, is the statutory basis for DOT and FAA authority and the Aviation and
Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, is the basis for TSA aviation security authority.

The DOT’s authority primarily
relates to economic aspects of air transportation, such as discriminatory pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates, subject to the authority of the President of the United States,
international routes, fares, rates and practices, and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. International operating rights for U.S. airlines are usually subject to bilateral
agreement between the U.S. and foreign governments. UPS Airlines has international route operating rights granted by the DOT and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient
operation of our international network. The efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is dependent on DOT and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions.

The FAA’s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of air transportation, including aircraft operating procedures, transportation of hazardous
materials, record keeping standards and maintenance activities, personnel and ground facilities. In 1988, the FAA granted us an operating certificate, which remains in effect so long as we meet the safety and operational requirements of the
applicable FAA regulations.



FAA regulations mandate an aircraft corrosion control program, along with aircraft inspection and repair
at periodic intervals specified by approved programs and procedures, for all aircraft. Our total expenditures under these programs for 2008 were $12 million. The future cost of repairs pursuant to these programs may fluctuate according to aircraft
condition, age and the enactment of additional FAA regulatory requirements.

The TSA regulates various security aspects of air cargo
transportation in a manner consistent with the TSA mission statement to “protect the Nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.” UPS Airlines, and specified airport and off airport
locations, are regulated under TSA regulations applicable to the transportation of cargo in an air network. In addition, personnel, facilities and procedures involved in air cargo transportation must comply with TSA regulations.

UPS Airlines, along with a number of other domestic airlines, participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) program. Our participation
in the CRAF program allows the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) to requisition specified UPS Airlines wide-body aircraft for military use during a national defense emergency. The DOD compensates us for the use of aircraft under the CRAF
program. In addition, participation in CRAF entitles UPS Airlines to bid for military cargo charter operations.

Ground Operations

Our ground transportation of packages in the U.S. is subject to the DOT’s jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of routes and to both the
DOT’s and the states’ jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of safety, insurance and hazardous materials.

We are subject
to similar regulation in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions, and non-U.S. customs regulation.

The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created the U.S. Postal Service as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government,
and vested the power to recommend domestic postal rates in a regulatory body, the Postal Rate Commission. We participate in the proceedings before the Postal Rate Commission in an attempt to secure fair postal rates for competitive services.

We are subject to numerous other laws and regulations in connection with our non-package businesses, including customs regulations, Food
and Drug Administration regulation of our transportation of pharmaceuticals, and state and federal lending regulations.

Customs

We are subject to U.S. customs laws and related DOT regulations regarding the import and export of shipments to and from the U.S. In addition, our customs
brokerage entities are subject to those same laws and regulations as they relate to the filing of documents on behalf of client importers and exporters.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The following
are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward-looking statements:

•

The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in
international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks.

•

The impact of competition on a local, regional, national, and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations,
various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business.

•

The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new
laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of September 11, 2001. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of
our authority to conduct our operations.

•

Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs, and customers may do more business with
competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also
may affect our competitive position and results of operations.



•

Possible disruption of supplies, or unanticipated changes in the prices, of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles, as a result of
war, actions by producers, or other factors. We require significant quantities of fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products.

•

Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services.

Properties

Operating Facilities

We own our headquarters, which are located in Atlanta, Georgia and consist
of about 735,000 square feet of office space on an office campus, and our UPS Supply Chain Solutions group’s headquarters, which are located in Alpharetta, Georgia and consist of about 310,000 square feet of office space.

We also own our 27 principal U.S. package operating facilities, which have floor spaces that range from about 310,000 to 693,000 square feet. In
addition, we have a 1.9 million square foot operating facility near Chicago, Illinois, which is designed to streamline shipments between East Coast and West Coast destinations, and we own or lease over 1,100 additional smaller package operating
facilities in the U.S. The smaller of these facilities have vehicles and drivers stationed for the pickup of packages and facilities for the sorting, transfer and delivery of packages. The larger of these facilities also service our vehicles and
equipment and employ specialized mechanical installations for the sorting and handling of packages.

We own or lease almost 600 facilities
that support our international package operations and over 900 facilities that support our freight forwarding and logistics operations. Our freight forwarding and logistics operations maintain facilities with about 35 million square feet of
floor space. We own and operate a logistics campus consisting of approximately 3.5 million square feet in Louisville, Kentucky.

UPS
Freight operates approximately 200 service centers with a total of 5.9 million square feet of floor space. UPS Freight owns 135 of these service centers, while the remainder are occupied under operating lease agreements. The main offices of UPS
Freight are located in Richmond, Virginia and consist of about 240,000 square feet of office space.

Our aircraft are operated in a hub and
spokes pattern in the U.S. Our principal air hub in the U.S., known as Worldport, is located in Louisville, KY. The Worldport facility consists of over 4.1 million square feet and the site includes approximately 596 acres. We are able to sort
over 300,000 packages per hour in the Worldport facility. We also have regional air hubs in Columbia, SC; Dallas, TX; Hartford, CT; Ontario, CA; Philadelphia, PA; and Rockford, IL. These hubs house facilities for the sorting, transfer and delivery
of packages. Our European air hub is located in Cologne, Germany, and we maintain Asia-Pacific air hubs in Shanghai, China; Pampanga, Philippines; Taipei, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and Singapore. Our regional air hub in Canada is located in Hamilton,
Ontario, and our regional air hub for Latin America and the Caribbean is in Miami, FL.

In 2008, work continued on our Worldport facility
expansion that will increase sorting capacity by 37 percent to 416,000 packages per hour. The expansion involves the addition of two aircraft load / unload wings to the hub building, followed by the installation of high-speed conveyor and computer
control systems. The overall size of the Worldport facility will increase by 1.1 million square feet to 5.2 million square feet, and the facility will be able to accommodate the Boeing 747-400 aircraft currently on order. The expansion
will cost over $1 billion and is expected to be completed by 2010.



Over the past five years, UPS has made a successful transition to become the first wholly-owned foreign
express carrier in China. In 2008, we opened the UPS International Air Hub at Pudong International Airport, which was built on a parcel totaling 1 million square feet with a planned sorting capacity of 17,000 packages per hour. The new hub
links all of China via Shanghai to UPS’s international network with direct service to the Americas, Europe and Asia. It also connects points served in China by UPS through a dedicated service provided by Yangtze River Express, a Chinese
all-cargo airline.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we began construction of a new intra-Asia air hub at Shenzhen International Airport in
China. Once completed, the Shenzhen facility will replace our current intra-Asia air hub at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, and will serve as our primary transit hub in Asia. The facility is expected to open in 2010. The facility is being
built on a parcel of almost 1 million square feet, and will have a planned sorting capacity of 18,000 packages per hour.

Our primary
information technology operations are consolidated in a 435,000 square foot owned facility, the Ramapo Ridge facility, which is located on a 39-acre site in Mahwah, New Jersey. We also own a 175,000 square foot facility located on a 25-acre site in
Alpharetta, Georgia, which serves as a backup to the main information technology operations facility in New Jersey. This facility provides production functions and backup capacity in the event that a power outage or other disaster incapacitates the
main data center. It also helps us to meet our internal communication needs.

We believe that our facilities are adequate to support our
current operations.

Fleet

Aircraft

The following table shows information about our aircraft fleet as of December 31, 2008:

We maintain an inventory of spare engines and parts for each aircraft.

All the aircraft we own meet Stage III federal noise regulations and can operate at airports that have aircraft noise restrictions. We became the first
major airline to successfully operate a 100% Stage III fleet, more than three years in advance of the date required by federal regulations.

During 2008, we took delivery of four Boeing 747-400F aircraft and two Boeing 747-400BCF aircraft. We have firm commitments to purchase 27 Boeing 767-300ER freighters to be delivered between 2009 and 2012,



and five Boeing 747-400F aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2009 and 2010. Also, during 2008 we sold eight Boeing 727-100 aircraft, two Boeing 727-200
aircraft, one McDonnell-Douglas DC-8-71 aircraft and one McDonnell-Douglas DC-8-73 aircraft.

Vehicles

We operate a ground fleet of approximately 107,000 package cars, vans, tractors and motorcycles. Our ground support fleet consists of 31,000 pieces of
equipment designed specifically to support our aircraft fleet, ranging from non-powered container dollies and racks to powered aircraft main deck loaders and cargo tractors. We also have 37,000 containers used to transport cargo in our aircraft.

Safety

We
promote safety throughout our operations. Our Automotive Fleet Safety Program is built with the following components:

•

Selection.

Five out of every six drivers come from our part-time ranks. Therefore, many of our new drivers are familiar with our philosophies, policies,
practices and training programs.

•

Training.

Training is the cornerstone of our Fleet Safety Program. Our approach starts with training the trainer. All trainers are certified to ensure that
they have the skills and motivation to effectively train novice drivers. A new driver’s employment includes extensive classroom and on-line training as well as on-road training, followed by three safety training rides integrated into his or her
training cycle.

•

Responsibility.

Our operations managers are responsible for their drivers’ safety records. We investigate every accident. If we determine that an
accident could have been prevented, we retrain the driver.

•

Preventive Maintenance.

An integral part of our Fleet Safety Program is a comprehensive Preventive Maintenance Program. Our fleet is tracked by computer to
ensure that each vehicle is serviced before a breakdown or accident is likely to occur.

•

Honor Plan.

A well-defined safe driver honor plan recognizes and rewards our drivers when they achieve success. We have over 4,450 drivers who have driven
for 25 years or more without an avoidable accident.

Our workplace safety program is built upon a comprehensive health
and safety process. The foundation of this process is our employee-management health and safety committees. The workplace safety process focuses on employee conditioning and safety-related habits. Our employee co-chaired health and safety committees
complete comprehensive facility audits and injury analyses, and recommend facility and work process changes.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are a
defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class-action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which was certified as a class action in a California federal court
in June 2004, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,300 full-time supervisors. In August
2005, the court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS on all claims, and plaintiff appealed the ruling. In October 2007, the appeals court reversed the lower court’s ruling. In April 2008, the Court decertified the class and vacated the
trial scheduled for April 29, 2008. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this
matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.



In another case, Hohider v. UPS, which in July 2007 was certified as a class action in a Pennsylvania
federal court, plaintiffs have challenged certain aspects of the Company’s interactive process for assessing requests for reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of over 35,000
current and former employees, and seek back-pay, and compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. In August 2007, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Company’s Petition to hear the appeal of the trial
court’s certification order. Oral argument took place in November 2008. The appeal will likely take one year. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we
have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

UPS and Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. are defendants in various lawsuits brought by franchisees who operate Mail Boxes Etc. centers and The UPS Store locations.
These lawsuits relate to the rebranding of Mail Boxes Etc. centers to The UPS Store, The UPS Store business model, the representations made in connection with the rebranding and the sale of The UPS Store franchises, and UPS’s sale of services
in the franchisees’ territories. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether
such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

UPS Freight,
along with several other companies involved in the LTL freight business, is a defendant in a Multi-District Litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The lawsuits allege that the defendants
conspired to fix fuel surcharge rates, and they seek injunctive relief, treble damages and attorneys’ fees. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases, and defendants’
motion to dismiss is pending for decision by the Court. These cases are at a preliminary stage and at this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that
arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. At this time, we have not determined the amount of
any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Other Matters

We received grand jury subpoenas from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) regarding the DOJ’s investigations into certain pricing practices in the air cargo industry in July 2006, and into certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry in December 2007. In October 2007 and June
2008, we received information requests from the European Commission relating to its investigation of certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry. We also received and responded to related information requests from competition
authorities in other jurisdictions. We are cooperating with these inquiries.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our Class A common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized over-the-counter market, but each share of our
Class A common stock is convertible into one share of our Class B common stock.

The following is a summary of our Class B common
stock price activity and dividend information for 2008 and 2007. Our Class B common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “UPS.”

As of January 29, 2009, there were 170,327 and 206,558 record holders of Class A and
Class B common stock, respectively.

The policy of our Board of Directors is to declare dividends out of current earnings. The declaration
of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors.

On February 11, 2009, our Board declared a dividend of $0.45 per share, which is payable on March 10, 2009 to shareowners of record on
February 23, 2009.

In January 2008, we announced a new financial policy regarding our capital structure to enhance shareowner value.
We intend to manage our balance sheet to a target debt ratio of approximately 50%-60% funds from operations to total debt. In connection with this policy, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $10.0
billion. Share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases, open market purchases, or other such methods as we deem appropriate. The timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions. Unless terminated earlier by
the resolution of our Board, the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program.

A
summary of repurchases of our Class A and Class B common stock during the fourth quarter of 2008 is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

U.S. Domestic Package Operations

2008 compared to 2007

U.S. domestic package revenue
increased $293 million, or 0.9%, for the year, largely due to a 3.0% improvement in revenue per piece, partially offset by a 2.0% decrease in average daily package volume.

Next Day Air volume, deferred air volume and ground volume declined 7.1%, 2.8%, and 1.4%, respectively for the year, primarily as a result of the current
U.S. recession. These declining volume trends worsened through the year with Next Day Air, deferred air, and ground volume declining 8.6%, 3.5%, and 2.1%, respectively, during the fourth quarter. Relatively high energy costs during most of the year
combined with the deepening recession and weak output within the industrial production and retail sales sectors adversely affected the small package market, which places additional pressure on our domestic package volume.

The increase in overall revenue per piece of 3.0% resulted primarily from a rate increase that took effect during the first quarter and higher fuel
surcharge rates, but was partially offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix. Next Day Air and Deferred revenue per piece increased 4.8% and 1.8%, respectively, and were positively impacted by the base rate increase and a higher fuel surcharge
rate for air products (discussed further below). This increase was adversely impacted by lower average package weights, a mix shift toward lower yielding products, and hedging losses. Ground revenue per piece increased 3.9%, mainly due to the rate
increase, as well as a higher fuel surcharge rate due to increased diesel fuel prices in 2008 compared with 2007.

On November 9,
2007, we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on December 31, 2007. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS Ground. Other pricing
changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and an increase of $0.10 in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes.

We also modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. This fuel surcharge
continues to be based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 25.17% in 2008, an increase from the 12.17% in
2007, due to the significant increase in jet fuel prices in early and mid-2008, but partially offset by the 2% reduction in the index. The ground fuel surcharge rate continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel
Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products increased to 7.97% in 2008 from 4.30% in 2007, due to significantly higher diesel fuel prices in early and mid-2008. Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue,
net of the impact of hedging losses, increased by $1.119 billion in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to the higher fuel surcharge rates discussed above, but partially offset by the decline in volume for our air and ground products.

U.S. domestic package operating profit increased $5.438 billion in 2008 compared with 2007. Operating profit for 2007 was adversely affected by a
charge to withdraw from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest



Areas Pension Fund (“Central States Pension Fund”), an aircraft impairment and a Special Voluntary Separation Opportunity (“SVSO”) charge
(all discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section), which reduced domestic operating profit by $6.100 billion, $159 million and $53 million, respectively. The absence of these charges in 2008 favorably affected the operating
profit comparison between periods.

Operating profit in 2008 was adversely impacted by the current U.S. recession, lower asset utilization
due to the decline in volume, lower average package weights, and a shift in product mix away from our premium services, partially offset by the increase in the fuel surcharge relative to the cost of fuel. Because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the
latter half of the year, operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments. Because of this time lag, fuel positively impacted the
change in operating profit during 2008, which is opposite of the effect the company experienced in 2007, when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted.

2007 compared to 2006

U.S. Domestic Package revenue
increased $529 million, or 1.7%, in 2007, due to a 1.6% improvement in revenue per piece and a 0.4% increase in average daily package volume. Next Day Air volume increased 0.8% and Ground volume increased 0.6% for the year, largely as a result of a
solid peak season in the fourth quarter, when our Next Day Air volume rose 2.2% and Ground volume increased 1.5%. Deferred air volume declined 1.9% in 2007. Our domestic air and ground products have been impacted by the slowing U.S. economy and weak
small package market in 2007. Trends in U.S. industrial production and business-to-consumer shipments in 2007 were not favorable to the overall small package market, which places pressure on our domestic package volume.

The increase in overall revenue per piece of 1.6% in 2007 resulted primarily from a rate increase that took effect earlier in the year, but was
negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue and an unfavorable shift in product mix. Next Day Air revenue per piece declined 0.9%, and was negatively impacted by strong growth in our lower-yielding Next Day Air Saver products. Deferred
revenue per piece increased only 0.4%. The change in revenue per piece for all our air products was negatively impacted by a lower fuel surcharge rate (discussed further below). Ground revenue per piece increased 2.9%, primarily due to the rate
increase, but was also impacted slightly by a higher fuel surcharge due to higher diesel fuel prices in 2007 compared with 2006. Overall product mix reduced revenue per piece, as our premium air products suffered volume declines while our ground
volume grew 0.6%.

Consistent with the practice in previous years, a rate increase
took effect on January 1, 2007. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2

nd

Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS
Ground. Other pricing changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and a $0.75 increase in the charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts.

In January 2007, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. This fuel
surcharge continued to be based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 12.17% in 2007, a decline from the
14.02% in 2006, primarily due to the 2% reduction in the index. The ground fuel surcharge rate continued to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on
domestic ground products was 4.30% in 2007, an increase from 4.13% in 2006, due to higher diesel fuel prices. As a result of the air products index rate reduction and fuel market price movements, total domestic fuel surcharge revenue decreased by
$110 million in 2007.

U.S. Domestic Package incurred an operating loss of $1.531 billion in 2007, compared with a $4.923 billion operating
profit in 2006, largely due to a $6.100 billion charge related to our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund. Additionally, Domestic Package operating results were negatively impacted by low revenue



growth, the aircraft impairment charge, the SVSO charge, and the impact of fuel. The aircraft impairment and SVSO charges reduced domestic operating profit
by $159 million and $53 million, respectively. Fuel negatively impacted the change in operating profit during 2007, as fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate. These factors were partially offset by cost controls, including, among
other categories, lower self-insurance expense. The expense associated with our self-insurance accruals for workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities declined as a result of several factors. The Central
States Pension Fund withdrawal, aircraft impairment, and SVSO charges, as well as the impact of lower self-insurance expense, are discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section.

International Package Operations

compared to 2007

International Package revenue improved $1.012 billion, or 9.8%, for the year, driven by a 6.8% volume increase for our
export products and a 6.1% increase in total revenue per piece. The growth in revenue per piece was primarily due to rate increases, the impact of currency exchange rates, and increased fuel surcharge rates. However, as the global economic recession
deepened throughout the year, fourth quarter revenue trended downward compared to the prior year fourth quarter, declining $230 million, or 8.0%, including the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations discussed later.

Export volume increased in each region throughout the world in 2008, however volume began to slow in the latter half of 2008 due to difficult worldwide
economic conditions. Intra-regional volume continued to experience solid growth, especially in Europe. Asian export volume continued to benefit from our geographic service expansion, including the connection of several cities to our new air hub in
Shanghai, China. Export volume growth was negatively impacted by declines in shipments to the U.S. from other regions in the world, due to the slowing U.S. economy. Export volume trends weakened in the latter half of the year, due to the severe
global economic slowdown, with fourth quarter export volume increasing at a much slower rate than what has been experienced over the last several years. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 1.6% for the year, and was impacted by volume growth in our
domestic businesses in the Euro zone and Canada, but negatively affected by the weak economic conditions in the United Kingdom.

Export
revenue per piece increased 3.7% for the year, largely due to base rate increases, higher fuel surcharge rates, and favorable currency exchange rates, but was adversely impacted by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder
products and a shift away from our premium services. Domestic revenue per piece increased 6.0% for the year, and was affected by rate increases, higher fuel surcharge rates, and favorable exchange rates. Total average revenue per piece increased
2.7% on a currency-adjusted basis, and the overall change in segment revenue was positively affected by $324 million during the year due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity. Total revenue per piece declined 8.2% in the fourth quarter
of 2008, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar (currency-adjusted revenue per piece declined 3.0%), but also impacted by an acceleration in the shift away from our premium services and lower package weights. Fourth quarter 2008
total segment revenue was negatively impacted by $144 million due to the currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity.

On
December 31, 2007, we increased the base rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for
international shipments originating outside the United States vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year.

Additionally, we
modified the fuel surcharge on certain U.S.-related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continues to be indexed to fuel
prices in our different international regions, depending upon where the shipment takes place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $586 million in 2008, due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as
an increase in international air volume.



International Package operating profit decreased $251 million, or 13.7%, in 2008, and the operating
margin declined to 14.0% from 17.8% in 2007. The decline in operating profit and operating margin were affected by reduced asset utilization resulting from changes in economic conditions and trade flows, such as the reduced import volume into the
United States. Operating profit and margin were also negatively affected by a shift in product mix away from our premium services, as well as expenses associated with integration activities in our delivery network. Global economic weakness resulted
in a weakening operating profit trend, with fourth quarter operating profit declining 34.3%.

Because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the
latter half of the year, operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments. As a result of this time lag, fuel positively impacted
the change in operating profit during 2008, which is opposite of the effect the company experienced in 2007, when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted. The change in operating profit
was also positively affected by $136 million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates, net of hedging activity.

Operating
profit in 2008 was adversely impacted by a fourth quarter $27 million impairment charge incurred on certain intangible assets in our domestic package business in the United Kingdom (discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section).
Operating profit for 2007 was adversely affected by the aircraft impairment and SVSO charges ($62 million of the aircraft impairment charge and $7 million of the SVSO charge impacted the International Package segment), and the absence of these
charges in 2008 favorably affected the operating profit comparison between periods.

2007 compared to 2006

International Package revenue improved $1.192 billion, or 13.1% in 2007, driven by a 10.4% volume increase for our export products and an 8.3% increase in
total revenue per piece. The growth in revenue per piece was positively impacted by base rate increases and the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against several major foreign currencies in 2007, but was adversely affected by a lower fuel surcharge
rate applied to our U.S. origin international air products.

Export volume increased throughout the world. Asian export volume grew
strongly in key markets during the year, especially China. Asian export volume continues to benefit from our geographic service expansion, as well as strong economic growth, which benefits our intra-Asian package business. To continue this
expansion, we received authority in 2007 to operate six daily flights between the U.S. and Nagoya, Japan, and began constructing a package and freight air hub in Shanghai, China that will link Shanghai to our international air network, with direct
service to Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

European export volume also grew solidly, largely due to continued growth in the transborder
business and improved economic and industrial output in the European Union. U.S. export volume increased at a slower pace. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 2.2% for the year, and was impacted by growth in several major European countries and
Canada.

Export revenue per piece increased 3.9% for the year, largely due to rate increases and favorable exchange rates, but was
adversely impacted by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products, and a reduction in certain fuel surcharge rates. Non-U.S. domestic revenue per piece increased 9.6% for the year, and was affected by rate increases and
favorable exchange rates. Total average revenue per piece increased 2.7% on a currency-adjusted basis, and the overall change in segment revenue was positively affected by $464 million in 2007 due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity.

In January 2007, we increased rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide
Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year.



Also in January 2007, we modified the fuel surcharge on certain U.S.-related international air services
by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions. Total international fuel surcharge
revenue increased by $12 million during the year due to increased volume, but was partially offset by the reduction in the fuel surcharge index.

International Package operating profit increased $121 million, or 7.1%, for the year, primarily due to the volume and revenue per piece improvements described above. The change in operating profit was also positively affected by $153
million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates, net of hedging activity. International Package operating profit was adversely affected in 2007 by charges related to the aircraft impairment ($62 million) and the SVSO ($7 million),
both of which are discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section. Operating profit was negatively impacted by fuel, as the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was more than offset by the increase in fuel expense. The adverse impact
of the aircraft impairment, SVSO charge, and fuel were the primary causes of the 100 basis point decline in operating margin to 17.8%.

Supply Chain & Freight Operations

2008 compared to 2007

Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $489 million, or 5.8%, for the year. Forwarding and logistics revenue increased $382 million, or 6.5%,
for the year, primarily due to growth in international air freight, North American air freight, distribution services and mail services. Revenue growth in this business was affected by fuel and security surcharges, expanded air freight service
offerings, overall market growth and improved customer retention rates. Growth was negatively impacted by weakness in the ocean freight business. Revenue declined by $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 2007, as difficult
worldwide economic conditions, slowing world trade, and unfavorable currency exchange rate movements negatively impacted the forwarding and logistics business. The overall change in forwarding and logistics revenue was positively affected by $166
million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates, but was negatively impacted by $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.

UPS Freight increased revenue $83 million, or 3.9%, for the year, as a result of improved yields and higher fuel surcharge rates, but partially offset by a decline in average daily LTL shipments. Average LTL shipments per day decreased 4.6%
during the year, reflecting the weak LTL market in the United States in 2008 as compared with 2007. However, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 7.3% for the year, due to an increase in base rates in 2008 and an increase in fuel surcharge
revenue as a result of higher diesel prices. The weak U.S. LTL market declined further in the fourth quarter of 2008, which led to a revenue decline of $41 million, or 7.8%, from the comparable quarter of 2007. Fourth quarter average LTL shipments
per day decreased 8.2%, with LTL revenue per hundredweight declining 2.4%, partially due to declining fuel surcharge rates.

In January
2008, UPS Freight announced a general rate increase averaging 5.4% covering non-contractual shipments in the United States and Canada. The increase became effective on February 4, 2008, and applies to minimum charge, LTL and TL rates.

The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business and our financial business,
increased revenue by 5.9% during the year. This revenue growth was impacted by increased revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the U.S. Postal Service.

Operating profit for the Supply Chain & Freight segment decreased by $383 million for the year, primarily due to a $548 million goodwill
impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter in the UPS Freight business unit, as discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section. Operating profit improved in the forwarding and logistics business, primarily resulting from
revenue management initiatives and a focus on asset utilization. The change in operating profit was also positively affected by $12 million in 2008 due to favorable currency exchange rates.



Operating profit for this segment was negatively impacted in 2007 by $8 million due to the SVSO charge
and by $46 million as a result of a charge for restructuring and disposing of certain non-core business units in France, as discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section. The absence of these charges in 2008 favorably affected the
operating profit comparison between periods.

2007 compared to 2006

Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $424 million, or 5.3%, in 2007. Forwarding and logistics revenue increased $230 million, or 4.0%, for the year, and was affected by favorable exchange rate movements
and revenue management initiatives begun in 2006. Favorable exchange rate movements positively affected the growth in revenue by $178 million during the year. Revenue growth in this business was driven by improvements in international air freight
and mail services, which were impacted by overall market growth and lower customer turnover rates.

UPS Freight increased revenue $156
million, or 8.0%, for the year as a result of improved yields and a strong increase in average daily shipment volume. Average LTL shipments per day increased 8.3% during the year, driven by new customer wins and leveraging our existing small package
customer base for new sales opportunities. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 9.3% during the year, due to an increase in base rates in 2007 and a focus on higher-yielding customer segments. The increase in revenue per hundredweight and average
daily shipments were somewhat offset by a 7.5% decrease for the year in the LTL weight per shipment.

The other businesses within Supply
Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business, our financial business, and our U.S. domestic cargo operations, increased revenue by 10.3% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue from our
contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the U.S. Postal Service.

Operating profit for the Supply Chain &
Freight segment was $278 million in 2007, compared with a profit of $2 million in 2006, resulting in a 330 basis point improvement in the operating margin. This improvement was largely due to improved results in the forwarding and logistics business
as a result of cost controls, a focus on asset utilization, and revenue management initiatives. Cost improvements were realized as a result of the restructuring program that began in 2006, which included a reduction of non-operating staff of
approximately 1,400 people. Additionally, margin improvements are being realized by focusing on capacity utilization in the air freight business, through better utilizing space available on our own aircraft. Finally, revenue management initiatives
put into place last year are producing better returns through reducing less profitable accounts, and ensuring that new accounts meet specific criteria that allow us to better utilize our existing transportation assets.

Operating profit in 2007 for this segment was reduced by $46 million as a result of a charge for restructuring and disposing of certain non-core business
units in France, as well as by $8 million due to the SVSO charge. These charges are discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section. Currency fluctuations positively affected the growth in operating profit by $18 million in 2007.

Operating Expenses

compared to 2007

Consolidated operating expenses decreased by $3.010 billion, or 6.1%, for the year, primarily due to a reduction in
compensation and benefits expense. Currency fluctuations in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments accounted for approximately $342 million of increased operating expenses from 2007 to 2008.

Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $5.682 billion, or 17.9%, for the year, and was impacted by several items. The primary reason for the
decrease was a reduction in pension expense for our multiemployer pension plans, largely relating to a $6.100 billion charge in 2007 to withdraw from the Central States Pension



Fund. Partially offsetting this was a $216 million increase in expense for UPS-sponsored pension plans in the U.S., which was impacted by expense recognition
now being required for the new UPS IBT Pension Plan. Non-pension benefits expense increased largely due to higher employee health and welfare program costs, which is impacted by medical cost inflation. Employee payroll costs increased due to
contractual wage increases for our union employees and normal merit increases for our non-union employees. Compensation and benefits expense also declined due to the absence in 2008 of the SVSO and France restructuring charges, which had increased
compensation and benefits expense by $68 and $42 million in 2007, respectively.

The 3.2% increase in repairs and maintenance was largely
due to increased aircraft maintenance, somewhat offset by reduced vehicle maintenance expense. The 4.0% increase in depreciation and amortization was influenced by several factors, including higher depreciation expense on aircraft and vehicles
resulting from new deliveries, but partially offset by reduced amortization expense on capitalized software resulting from a decrease in software development projects. The 11.0% increase in purchased transportation was driven by a combination of
higher volume in our international package and forwarding businesses, the impact of currency exchange rates, and increased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by third-party carriers. The 39.0% increase in fuel expense was impacted by higher prices
for jet-A fuel, diesel, and unleaded gasoline as well as lower hedging gains. The 7.2% increase in other occupancy expense was influenced by higher electricity and natural gas costs, as well as higher rent and property tax expense. During the fourth
quarter of 2008, declining energy prices impacted costs such as purchased transportation, which decreased $132 million, or 7.6%, and fuel, which decreased $118 million, or 12.7%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2007.

Other expenses increased 14.9% for the year primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. In addition, we also experienced increased
expenses for leased transportation equipment, data processing, advertising, professional services, and bad debts. These factors were partially offset by the absence in 2008 of a $221 million aircraft impairment charge recorded in 2007.

We test our goodwill for impairment annually, as of October 1

st

, on a reporting unit basis in accordance with FASB Statement No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”). Our
reporting units are comprised of the Europe, Asia, and Americas reporting units in the International Package reporting segment, and the Forwarding & Logistics, UPS Freight, MBE / UPS Store, and UPS Capital reporting units in the Supply
Chain & Freight reporting segment. The impairment test involves a two-step process. First, a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values, including goodwill, is performed. We primarily
determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model, and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies, as applicable. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting
unit’s fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying
value of that goodwill.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our UPS
Freight reporting unit, which was formed through the acquisition of Overnite Corporation in 2005, had a goodwill impairment of $548 million. This impairment charge resulted from several factors, including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer
estimated economic recovery time for the LTL sector, and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar LTL industry participants. At the time of acquisition of Overnite Corporation, LTL equity valuations were higher and the
economy was significantly stronger. We invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance, as well as expand service offerings. However, this process took longer than initially anticipated, and thus
financial results have been below our expectations. Additionally, the LTL sector in 2008 has been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the U.S., lower industrial production and retail sales, volatile fuel prices, and significant levels of
price-based competition. By the fourth quarter of 2008, the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit, leading to the goodwill impairment charge. None of the other reporting units incurred an
impairment of goodwill in 2008, nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in 2007 or 2006.



As a result of weak performance in our domestic package operations in the United Kingdom, we reviewed our
long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment within our U.K. domestic package entity. Based on recent performance and near-term projections, the value assigned to a customer list intangible asset acquired within the U.K. domestic
package business was determined to be impaired. This was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with an acquired business. Accordingly, an intangible asset impairment charge of $27
million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008.

2007 compared to 2006

Consolidated operating expenses increased by $8.202 billion, or 20.0%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Currency fluctuations in our International Package and
Supply Chain & Freight segments resulted in consolidated operating expenses increasing by $471 million for the year.

Compensation
and benefits expense increased by $7.324 billion for the year, and was impacted by several items including the charge for the withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, higher wage rates in the union workforce, increased stock-based
compensation, higher expense for union pension and welfare programs, the SVSO charge, and the restructuring charge in our Supply Chain & Freight business in France. These increases were slightly offset by lower workers compensation expense.

Our national master agreement with the Teamsters allowed us, upon ratification, to withdraw employees from the Central States Pension Fund
and to establish a jointly trusteed single-employer plan for this group (“UPS IBT Pension Plan”). Upon ratification of the contract in December 2007 and our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, we recorded a pre-tax $6.100
billion charge to establish our withdrawal liability, and made a December 2007 payment in the same amount to the Central States Pension Fund to satisfy this liability.

The withdrawal liability was based on computations performed by independent actuaries employed by the Central States Pension Fund, in accordance with the plan document and the applicable requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). We negotiated our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund as part of our national master agreement with the Teamsters, which included other modifications to hourly wage rates,
healthcare and pension benefits, and work rules. We sought to negotiate our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, as we believed the fund would likely continue to have funding challenges, and would present a risk to UPS of having to face
higher future contribution requirements and a risk to the security of the pension benefits of those UPS employees who participated in the fund. We believe that we benefited financially from the ability to achieve a ratified national master agreement
seven months before the expiration of the previous agreement, as well as by gaining better control over the future cost and funding of pension benefits by limiting our obligations solely to UPS Teamster employees through the new UPS IBT Pension
Plan. As the UPS IBT Pension Plan matures, we believe that it will become cost beneficial from a cash flow and earnings standpoint compared with having remained in the Central States Pension Fund.

In December 2006, we offered the SVSO to approximately 640 employees who work in non-operating functions. This program was established to improve the
efficiency of non-operating processes by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company. The SVSO ended in February 2007, and 195, or 30% of eligible employees, accepted the offer. As a result, we recorded a charge to expense of
$68 million in the first quarter of 2007, to reflect the cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits under the SVSO program.

In the third quarter of 2007, we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in France. The objective of this
restructuring plan was to reduce our forwarding and logistics cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in the Europe region. The restructuring principally consisted of an employment reduction program, which was ratified by our
company’s trade union representatives in France in



July 2007. Employees participating in this program were entitled to severance benefits, including certain bonuses for employees participating in the
voluntary termination phase. These severance benefits were formula-driven and were in accordance with French statutory laws as well as the applicable collective bargaining agreements. We recorded a restructuring charge of $46 million ($42 million
related to severance costs, and thus recorded in compensation and benefits expense) in 2007 related to this program.

Stock-based and other
management incentive compensation expense increased $113 million, or 17.7%, during 2007, primarily due to 2007 awards of stock options, restricted performance units, and restricted stock units. Pension and healthcare expense increased during the
year, largely due to higher expense associated with plans covering union employees, but was somewhat offset by a $59 million decrease in expense for the UPS-sponsored pension plans in the U.S.

The expense associated with our self-insurance accruals for workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities was
$46 million lower in 2007 compared with 2006. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded
balances are based on reserve levels, which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. The lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from several company
initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors, including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies, improved oversight and management of claims, improved trends in health care costs, and favorable state legislative
reforms.

The 0.2% increase in repairs and maintenance reflects higher maintenance expense on aircraft, largely offset by lower maintenance
expense on vehicles and buildings. The 0.2% decrease in depreciation and amortization was influenced by several factors, including lower depreciation expense on aircraft and amortization expense on capitalized software, partially offset by increased
depreciation expense on vehicles. The 7.4% increase in purchased transportation was impacted by volume growth in our International Package business and currency fluctuations, as well as growth in our international forwarding business. The 12.0%
increase in fuel expense for the year was primarily due to higher prices for jet and diesel fuel, as well as higher usage, but was partially mitigated by hedging gains. Other occupancy expense increased 2.1% for the year, and was affected by
increased rent expense and property taxes, but partially offset by lower utilities expense. The 3.0% increase in other expenses for the year was affected by a $221 million aircraft impairment charge, discussed further below, but partially offset
with cost controls in several areas. The comparison in other expenses was also affected by an $87 million charge to settle class action litigation in 2006.

As a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007, including capacity-optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft
orders and planned delivery dates, we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses. The review was completed in March
2007, and based on the results of our evaluation we accelerated the planned retirement of certain Boeing 727 and 747 aircraft, and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of $221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in
2007. This charge is included in the caption “Other expenses” in the Statement of Consolidated Income, of which $159 million impacted our U.S. Domestic Package segment and $62 million impacted our International Package segment.

Investment Income and Interest Expense

2008 compared to 2007

The decrease in investment income of $24 million was primarily due to a lower average balance of
interest-earning investments, investment impairment charges, and a lower yield earned on our investments. During 2008, we recorded impairment losses on two auction rate securities that were collateralized by preferred stock issued by the Federal
National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”). The impairment followed actions by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Housing



Finance Agency with respect to FNMA and FHLMC. Additionally, we recorded impairment losses on a municipal auction rate security and on holdings of several
medium term notes issued by Lehman Brothers Inc., which declared bankruptcy during 2008. We do not hold any other securities in any of these entities. The total of these credit-related impairment losses during 2008 was $23 million, which was
recorded in investment income on the income statement.

Interest expense increased $196 million in 2008, primarily due to a higher average
balance of outstanding debt. In early 2008, we completed the issuance of $4.0 billion in long-term debt, the proceeds of which were used to reduce our commercial paper balance. Our commercial paper balances had previously increased to fund the
$6.100 billion Central States Pension Fund withdrawal payment in December 2007. The impact of increased debt balances was partially mitigated, however, by lower average rates incurred on our variable rate debt and interest rate swap agreements as a
result of declines in short-term interest rates in the United States throughout 2008.

2007 compared to 2006

The increase in investment income of $13 million was primarily due to higher realized gains on sales of investments, but partially offset by a lower
average balance of interest-earning investments and increased equity-method losses on investment partnerships.

Interest expense increased
$35 million in 2007, primarily due to higher average debt balances outstanding, largely related to commercial paper. Our commercial paper balances increased in the fourth quarter of 2007, causing a corresponding increase in interest expense, as a
result of the payment made to withdraw from the Central States Pension Fund. Increased interest charges were somewhat offset, however, by higher capitalized interest related to various construction projects, including aircraft purchases and our
Worldport expansion.

Income Tax Expense

2008 compared to 2007

Income tax expense increased by $1.963 billion in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to higher
pre-tax income. Pre-tax income in 2007 was adversely impacted by the Central States withdrawal charge, as noted previously. The effective tax rate was 40.1% in 2008, compared with 11.4% in 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily
due to several factors resulting from the Central States withdrawal charge in 2007. These factors included having proportionally lower tax credits in 2008, and the effect of having a much higher proportion of our taxable income in 2008 being subject
to tax in the United States, whereas a relatively greater proportion of taxable income in 2007 was subject to tax outside the United States, where effective tax rates are generally lower. The effective tax rate in 2008 was also 4.1 percentage points
higher due to the lack of tax deductibility of the $548 million goodwill and $27 million intangible impairment charges discussed previously.

compared to 2006

Income tax expense declined by $2.259 billion in 2007 compared with 2006, due to lower pre-tax income primarily
resulting from the Central States Pension Fund withdrawal charge. The effective tax rate was 11.4% in 2007 and 35.5% in 2006. During 2007, our effective tax rate was reduced primarily due to proportionally higher tax credits and the effect of having
a relatively larger proportion of our taxable income being earned in international jurisdictions with lower tax rates.

Net Income
and Earnings Per Share

2008 compared to 2007

Net income for 2008 was $3.003 billion, compared with the $382 million achieved in 2007, resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.94 in 2008 from $0.36 in 2007. The increase in net income was
largely due to the absence in 2008 of some of the previously discussed charges to expense in 2007. In 2007, net



income was negatively impacted by the after-tax impact of the charge recorded to reflect our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund ($3.772
billion), the charge related to the restructuring and disposal of certain logistics operations in France ($31 million), the aircraft impairment charge ($141 million), and SVSO charge ($43 million). The combination of these four charges reduced 2007
diluted earnings per share by $3.75.

In 2008, net income was adversely affected by the UPS Freight goodwill impairment charge ($548
million) and customer list intangible asset impairment charge in the United Kingdom ($27 million). The combination of these two charges reduced 2008 diluted earnings per share by $0.56. Net income during 2008 was also adversely impacted by the
deteriorating worldwide economic situation, as previously discussed. Earnings per share was favorably impacted by a reduction in outstanding shares as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program, as the total number of outstanding shares
declined by 4.3% during 2008.

2007 compared to 2006

Net income for 2007 was $382 million, a decrease from the $4.202 billion achieved in 2006, resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share to $0.36 in 2007 from $3.86 in 2006. This decrease in net income was
largely due to the after-tax $3.772 billion charge recorded to reflect our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund. Additionally, 2007 net income was adversely impacted by $31 million as a result of the restructuring charge in our France
Supply Chain & Freight business, $141 million as a result of the aircraft impairment charge, and $43 million as a result of the SVSO charge. These items were partially offset by the improved results in our International Package and Supply
Chain & Freight segments.

The reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share were largely due to the pension withdrawal,
aircraft impairment, France restructuring, and SVSO charges noted above. These items reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by $3.77 and $3.75 in 2007. Earnings per share was favorably impacted by a reduction in outstanding shares as a result
of our ongoing share repurchase program, as the total number of outstanding shares declined by 2.7% during 2007.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.426, $1.123, and $5.589 billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The increase in 2008 operating cash flows compared with 2007 was impacted by several items, including changes in pension
fundings, tax payments and refunds, and rates for our delivery services.

In 2007, operating cash flow was adversely impacted by the $6.100
billion payment made to withdraw from the Central States Pension Fund. Total contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans declined in 2008 compared with 2007, even excluding the Central States Pension Fund withdrawal payment. As
discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, total multiemployer pension plan fundings decreased by $473 million in 2008 compared with 2007 (excluding the $6.100 billion withdrawal charge in 2007), largely due to the lack of
contributions to the Central States Pension Fund in 2008 subsequent to our withdrawal. Additionally, contributions to our company-sponsored pension and postretirement plans declined by $441 million in 2008 compared with 2007, as we had no material
minimum funding requirements in 2008 and we made no significant discretionary contributions to our plans. As discussed further in the “Contractual Commitments” section, we do have minimum funding requirements in the next several years,
primarily related to the UPS IBT Pension Plan.

The increase in operating cash flow was also favorably impacted by the timing of tax
refunds and estimated tax payments in both 2008 and 2007. In 2008, we received an $850 million U.S. federal tax refund due to prior overpayments of our estimated tax liability, primarily resulting from the deductibility of the Central States Pension
Fund withdrawal payment for tax purposes. Additionally, the amount of U.S. federal quarterly estimated



income tax payments was lower in 2007 compared with 2006, also primarily relating to the deductibility of the pension withdrawal payment. As of
December 31, 2008, we have received substantially all of the expected cash tax benefits resulting from the withdrawal payment.

Changes in package volume and pricing affect operating cash flow. As noted previously, we increased rates in our package delivery and LTL services at the end of 2007. Additionally, in October 2008, we announced a base rate increase and a
change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on January 5, 2009. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 5.9% on UPS Ground. We also increased the base rates 6.9% for international
shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Other pricing changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and an increase of
$0.10 in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. These rate changes are customary, and are consistent with previous years’ rate increases. Additionally, we modified the fuel surcharge on
domestic and U.S.-origin international air services by reducing by 2% the index used to determine the fuel surcharge. The UPS Ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Rate
changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market.

In October 2008, UPS
Freight announced a general rate increase averaging 5.9% covering non-contractual shipments in the United States and Canada. The increase took effect on January 5, 2009, and applies to minimum charge, LTL and TL rates.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing
activities was $3.179, $2.199, and $2.340 billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The increase in cash used in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to increased net purchases of marketable securities. Net (purchases) sales of marketable
securities were ($278), $621, and $482 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The net sales of marketable securities in 2007 and 2006 were primarily used to fund our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, as well as to repurchase
shares.

Capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities, as follows (in millions):

As described in the “Contractual Commitments” section below, we have commitments for the
purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. The reduction in capital expenditures
was largely due to the timing of aircraft deliveries. Capital expenditures on buildings and facilities increased in 2008, primarily resulting from our Worldport hub expansion, as well as the expansion and new construction projects at other
facilities in Europe, Canada, and China. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we opened our new international air hub in Shanghai, China, and also began construction of our new intra-Asia air hub in Shenzhen, China.

We had a net cash use of $49 and $39 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and net cash generation of $68 million in 2006, due to originations, sales,
and customer paydowns of finance receivables, primarily in our commercial lending, asset-based lending, and leasing portfolios.



Other investing activities reflected a cash outflow of $363 million in 2008 as compared with a $46
million outflow in 2007 and a $120 million cash inflow in 2006, and was impacted by cash settlements of derivative contracts used in our energy and currency hedging programs, the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our Boeing 767-300
and Boeing 747-400 aircraft orders, and increases in restricted cash balances. In 2008, we entered into an escrow agreement with an insurance carrier to guarantee our self-insurance obligations. This agreement required us to provide $191 million in
cash collateral to the insurance carrier, which is classified as restricted cash within other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. We received (paid) cash related to purchases and settlements of energy
and currency derivative contracts of ($208), ($140), and $233 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(6.702), $2.297, and ($3.851) billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Our primary uses
of cash flows for financing activities are to repurchase shares, pay cash dividends, and make debt principal repayments.

We repaid debt
principal, net of issuances, of $921 million in 2008, compared with net issuances of debt of $6.509 billion in 2007. In 2007, we increased our commercial paper borrowings to fund the $6.100 billion withdrawal payment to the Central States Pension
Fund (commercial paper increased $6.575 billion at December 31, 2007 over December 31, 2006) upon ratification of our labor contract with the Teamsters, as previously discussed. In 2008, we repaid most of this commercial paper with the
proceeds from a $4.0 billion senior notes offering, as well as the $850 million U.S. federal tax refund received. In January 2008, we completed an offering of $1.750 billion of 4.50% senior notes due January 2013, $750 million of 5.50% senior notes
due January 2018, and $1.500 billion of 6.20% senior notes due January 2038. All of these notes pay interest semiannually, and allow for redemption of the notes by UPS at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a
“make-whole” amount, plus accrued interest. After pricing and underwriting discounts, we received a total of $3.961 billion in cash proceeds from the offering. Concurrent with the issuance these notes, we settled certain derivatives that
were designated as hedges of the notes offering, resulting in a cash outflow of $84 million (which is reported in other financing activities on the cash flow statement).

Other than commercial paper, repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations, redemption of certain tranches of UPS Notes, and principal payments on debt related
to our investment in certain partnerships. During 2008, we called for the redemption of $327 million of notes issued under our UPS Notes program, and the associated swaps on the notes were terminated. We consider the overall fixed and floating
interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt.

In January 2008, we announced a new financial policy regarding our capital structure to enhance shareowner value. We intend to manage our balance sheet to a target debt ratio of approximately 50%-60% funds from
operations to total debt. In connection with this policy, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $10.0 billion. Share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases, open market
purchases, or other such methods as we deem appropriate. The timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions. Unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our Board, the program will expire when we have purchased all shares
authorized for repurchase under the program. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we repurchased a total of 53.6, 35.9, and 32.6 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock for $3.558, $2.618, and $2.455 billion, respectively ($3.570,
$2.639, and $2.460 billion reported on the statement of cash flows due to timing of settlements).

Our quarterly cash dividends declared
were $0.45, $0.42, and $0.38 per share in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Additionally, in 2008 the Board of Directors approved an earlier payment schedule for the November dividend declaration, as in prior years this dividend was payable the
following January. As a result, a total of five dividend payments were made in 2008. This extra dividend payment, along with the higher quarterly



dividend per share, resulted in an increase in total cash dividends paid to $2.219 billion in 2008 from $1.703 billion in 2007 and $1.577 billion in 2006.
The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to
continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. On February 11, 2009, our Board declared a dividend of $0.45 per share, which is payable on March 10, 2009 to shareowners of record on February 23, 2009.

Sources of Credit

We are authorized to borrow up to
$10.0 billion under our U.S. commercial paper program. We had $2.922 billion outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2008, with an average interest rate of 0.55%. At December 31, 2008, we classified $1.0 billion of our commercial
paper as long-term debt on our balance sheet, based on our intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis in the future. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €1.0
billion in a variety of currencies, however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2008.

We maintain two
credit agreements with a consortium of banks. One of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of $4.5 billion, and expires on April 16, 2009. The second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion, and expires on
April 19, 2012. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities.

In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for
registered offerings of short or long-term debt securities.

As of December 31, 2008, our Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s
(“S&P”) short-term credit ratings were P-1 and A-1+, respectively, and our Moody’s and S&P long-term credit ratings were Aa2 and AA-, respectively, with a stable outlook from both of these credit rating agencies.

Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit
facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. These covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that may be incurred by the Company, and limit the amount of sale-leaseback transactions that the Company may engage in, to 10% of net
tangible assets each. As of December 31, 2008 and for all prior periods, we have satisfied these financial covenants. As of December 31, 2008, 10% of net tangible assets is equivalent to $2.156 billion, however we have no qualifying
sale-leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding. We do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity.

Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing
arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity.



Contractual Commitments

We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments, pension fundings, and certain other liabilities. We intend to satisfy these
obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008 (in millions):

Our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft. Capital leases, operating
leases, and purchase commitments, as well as our debt principal obligations, are discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our
fixed-rate debt, in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2008. The calculations of debt interest do not take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements. For debt
denominated in a foreign currency, the U.S. Dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments.

Purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding, the largest of which are orders for
aircraft, engines, and parts. As of December 31, 2008, we maintain orders for 27 Boeing 767-300ER freighters to be delivered between 2009 and 2012, and five Boeing 747-400F aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2009 and 2010. These aircraft
purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth.

Pension fundings represent the
anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to the UPS IBT Pension Plan, which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the Teamsters, as well as the UPS Retirement Plan and the UPS Pension Plan. These
plans are discussed further in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, using
discount rates, asset returns, and other assumptions appropriate for these plans. To the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections, the actual contributions made in future years could
materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above.

As a result of losses experienced in the global equity markets, our U.S.
domestic pension plans experienced a negative return on assets of approximately 26% in 2008, however these losses did not trigger any minimum funding requirement for contributions in 2009 in the UPS Retirement Plan or UPS Pension Plan. The amount of
any minimum funding requirement, as applicable, for these plans could change significantly in future periods, depending on many factors, including future plan asset returns and discount rates. A sustained significant decline in the world equity
markets, and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns, could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements. Such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on
our financial position and cash flows in future periods.

The contractual payments due under the “other liabilities” column
primarily includes commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships. The table above does not include approximately $388 million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recognized as liabilities in accordance with FASB
Interpretation No. 48,



“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), because we are uncertain
if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash. In addition, although we have recognized and disclosed unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48, we also have outstanding recognized tax benefits in excess of the recorded
liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities. FIN 48 is discussed further in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $2.132 billion issued in connection with routine business
requirements. We also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances, and as of December 31, 2008, we had $262 million of surety bonds written. As of December 31, 2008, we had unfunded loan commitments
totaling $885 million associated with our financial business.

We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide
adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, such as commitments for aircraft purchases, for the foreseeable future.

Contingencies

We are a defendant in a
number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class-action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which was certified as a class action in a California federal court in June 2004,
plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,300 full-time supervisors. In August 2005, the
court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS on all claims, and plaintiff appealed the ruling. In October 2007, the appeals court reversed the lower court’s ruling. In April 2008, the Court decertified the class and vacated the trial
scheduled for April 29, 2008. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or
whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

In
another case, Hohider v. UPS, which in July 2007 was certified as a class action in a Pennsylvania federal court, plaintiffs have challenged certain aspects of the Company’s interactive process for assessing requests for reasonable
accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of over 35,000 current and former employees, and seek back-pay, and compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. In August 2007,
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Company’s Petition to hear the appeal of the trial court’s certification order. Oral argument took place in November 2008. The appeal will likely take one year. We have denied any liability
with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

UPS and Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. are defendants in various lawsuits
brought by franchisees who operate Mail Boxes Etc. centers and The UPS Store locations. These lawsuits relate to the rebranding of Mail Boxes Etc. centers to The UPS Store, The UPS Store business model, the representations made in connection with
the rebranding and the sale of The UPS Store franchises, and UPS’s sale of services in the franchisees’ territories. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. At this time, we have
not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

UPS Freight, along with several other companies involved in the LTL freight business, is a defendant in a Multi-District Litigation pending in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The lawsuits allege that the defendants conspired to fix fuel surcharge rates, and they seek injunctive relief, treble damages and attorneys’ fees. We have denied any liability with
respect to these claims and intend to vigorously



defend ourselves in these cases, and defendants’ motion to dismiss is pending for decision by the Court. These cases are at a preliminary stage and at
this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

We file income tax returns in the U.S.
federal jurisdiction, most U.S. state and local jurisdictions, and many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2008, we had substantially resolved all U.S. federal income tax matters for tax years prior to 1999. In February and July 2008,
the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) completed its audit of the tax years 1999 through 2002 and tax years 2003 through 2004, respectively, with only a limited number of issues that will be considered by the IRS Appeals Office by the end of
2009. In late 2008, the IRS began the initial planning phase of the income tax audit for tax years 2005 through 2007. Along with this audit for tax years 2005 through 2007, the IRS is currently examining non-income based taxes, including employment
and excise taxes on transportation of property by air and fuel purchases, which could lead to proposed assessments. The IRS has not presented an official position with regard to these taxes at this time, and therefore we are not able to determine
the technical merit of any potential assessment; however, we do not believe that the resolution of this matter would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. With few exceptions, we are no
longer subject to U.S. state and local and non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years prior to 1999, but certain U.S. state and local matters are subject to ongoing litigation.

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 260,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with
local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. In September 2007, we reached a new national master agreement with the Teamsters, which was ratified in December 2007. The new agreement provides for wage increases as well as contributions to healthcare
and pension plans, and most economic provisions of the new five year agreement took effect on August 1, 2008, with the exception of our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund which occurred in 2007. We have approximately 2,900 pilots
who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which becomes amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which
became amendable in November 2006. We began formal negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727 in October 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective
bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (approximately 3,000). These agreements run through July 31, 2009.

We participate in a number of trustee-managed multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could cause us to make significantly
higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if
any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans.

Other Matters

We received grand jury subpoenas from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ regarding the DOJ’s
investigations into certain pricing practices in the air cargo industry in July 2006, and into certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry in December 2007. In October 2007 and June 2008, we received information requests from the
European Commission relating to its investigation of certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry. We also received and responded to related information requests from competition authorities in other jurisdictions. We are cooperating
with these inquiries.



New Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”), which was issued to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and expand
disclosures about fair value measurements, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of FAS 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities, and
removed certain leasing transactions from its scope. We adopted FAS 157 on January 1, 2008, and the impact of adoption was not material to our results of operations or financial condition. The disclosures required by FAS 157 are discussed in
Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158 “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R))” (“FAS 158”). This statement requires us to recognize the funded status of defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet, and required delayed recognition items, consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits, to be recognized in other comprehensive
income and subsequently amortized to the income statement. On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158, which resulted in a reduction to AOCI of $2.097 billion and a reduction of long-term deferred tax
liabilities of $1.258 billion.

Additionally, we previously utilized the early measurement date option available under Statement
No. 87 “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”, and we measured the funded status of our plans as of September 30 each year. Under the provisions of FAS 158, we were required to use a December 31 measurement date for all
of our pension and postretirement benefit plans beginning in 2008. As a result of this change in measurement date, we recorded a cumulative effect after-tax $44 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008. The adoption of FAS
158 is discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159 “The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“FAS 159”), which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value (i.e., the fair value
option), on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. The election to use the fair value option is available at specified election dates, such as when an entity first
recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment. Subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. Additionally, FAS 159 allows for a one-time election for existing positions upon adoption,
with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings. We adopted FAS 159 on January 1, 2008, and elected to apply the fair value option to our investment in certain investment partnerships that were previously accounted for
under the equity method. Accordingly, we recorded a $16 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008, representing the cumulative effect adjustment of adopting FAS 159. The adoption of FAS 159 is discussed in Note 16 to the
consolidated financial statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 requires that we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related
appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial
statements. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48, and the impact of this Interpretation is discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

In June 2007, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 06-11, “Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment
Awards.” EITF 06-11 requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units, which are expected to vest, be recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 is applied prospectively for tax
benefits on dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. We adopted the provisions of EITF 06-11 beginning in the first quarter of 2008. This adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or
financial condition.



In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R) “Business Combinations” (“FAS
141(R)”). FAS 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition); establishes the
acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs; and requires the acquirer to disclose in its financial statements the
information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. FAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact of
FAS No. 141(R) on our consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (“FAS 160”).
FAS 160 requires reporting entities to present noncontrolling (minority) interests as equity (as opposed to as a liability or mezzanine equity) and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests.
As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $5 million in noncontrolling interests classified in other non-current liabilities. FAS 160 applies prospectively as of January 1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements
which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, “Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“FAS 161”), which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of
accounting for such instruments under FAS 133 and its related interpretations, and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. We adopted FAS 161
on January 1, 2009. FAS 161 only impacts our disclosures, and does not impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. These new disclosures will be required for us beginning in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
March 31, 2009.

In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset
When the Market for That Asset is Not Active” (“FSP 157-3”). FSP 157-3 clarifies the application of FAS 157, which we adopted as of January 1, 2008, in cases where a market is not active. We have considered the guidance provided
by FSP 157-3 in our determination of estimated fair values as of December 31, 2008, and the impact was not material.

In December
2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosure about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets”, which amends Statement 132(R) to require more detailed disclosures about employers’ pension plan assets. New disclosures
will include more information on investment strategies, major categories of assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. This new standard requires new disclosures only,
and will have no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. These new disclosures will be required for us beginning in our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary
to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related
amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.



Contingencies

—As discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, we are
involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“FAS 5”). FAS 5
requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our
estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result.

The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. At the time a contingency is identified, we
consider all relevant facts as part of our FAS 5 evaluation. We record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of FAS 5. These criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably
estimable. Events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. These factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual
operating results. Contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under FAS 5, excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below, were not material to the Company’s financial position as of
December 31, 2008. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of December 31, 2008, because a loss is not reasonably estimable.

Goodwill and Intangible Impairment

—We account for goodwill in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units. Our reporting units are comprised
of the Europe, Asia, and Americas reporting units in the International Package reporting segment, and the Forwarding & Logistics, UPS Freight, MBE / UPS Store, and UPS Capital reporting units in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting
segment. Our annual goodwill impairment testing date is October 1

st

for each reporting unit. The impairment test involves a two-step process.
First, a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values, including goodwill, is performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the
second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.

We primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model (“DCF model”), and supplement this with
observable valuation multiples for comparable companies, as applicable. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of
future revenue, costs and working capital changes. In addition, we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables, as required, in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. The projections that we use in
our DCF model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. The determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of
judgment in these assumptions, and changes in our business strategy, government regulations, or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments. We will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim
impairment tests are necessary in future periods. If impairment indicators are present in future periods, the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our UPS Freight reporting unit, which was formed
through the acquisition of Overnite Corporation in 2005, had a goodwill impairment of $548 million. This impairment charge resulted from several factors, including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time for the
LTL sector, and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar LTL industry participants. At the time of acquisition of Overnite Corporation, LTL equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger. We invested
in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance, as well as



expand service offerings. However, this process took longer than initially anticipated, and thus financial results have been below our expectations.
Additionally, the LTL sector in 2008 has been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the U.S., lower industrial production and retail sales, volatile fuel prices, and significant levels of price-based competition. By the fourth quarter of
2008, the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit, leading to the goodwill impairment charge. None of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in 2008, nor did we have
any goodwill impairment charges in 2007 or 2006.

All of our recorded intangible assets other than goodwill are deemed to be finite-lived
intangibles, and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 144”),
impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible. If the
carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on a DCF model. As a result of weak performance in our domestic U.K. package operations, we reviewed our
intangible assets for impairment within our U.K. domestic package entity. Based on recent performance and near-term projections, the value assigned to a customer list intangible asset acquired within the UK domestic package business was determined
to be impaired. This was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with an acquired business. Accordingly, an intangible asset impairment charge of $27 million was recorded for the year
ended December 31, 2008. No other intangible asset impairments were recognized in 2008, nor were any such impairments recognized in 2007 or 2006.

Self-Insurance Accruals

—We self-insure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance
reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels, which incorporate
historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are
adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations.

Workers’ compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully
resolve the claims. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for
events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. Changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self-insurance accruals. All of these factors can
result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results.

We
sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. These liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by
participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. Actual results may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results.

Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits

—As discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain several defined
benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87,
“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than



Pensions.” These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan
assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We
believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable, and represent our best estimates, based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future
expectations to differ from past trends. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate, expected return
on assets, and health care cost trend rate for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases (decreases) on the Company’s costs and obligations for the year 2008 (in millions):

Fair Value Measurements

—In the normal course of business, we hold and issue financial
instruments that contain elements of market risk, including derivatives, marketable securities, finance receivables, other investments, and debt. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value, principally
derivatives, marketable securities, and certain other investments. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other
relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations,
time value, credit spreads, and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. A
quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices is presented in the “Market Risk” section of this report.

Our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value have been categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy in accordance with FAS 157. Level 1 inputs
utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are based on other observable market data, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable,
such as interest rates and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions, and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability.



The following is a general description of the valuation methodologies used for financial assets and
liabilities measured at fair value, including the general classification of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

Derivative Contracts

—Our foreign currency, interest rate, and energy derivatives are largely comprised of over-the-counter derivatives, which are primarily valued using pricing models that
rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves, currency exchange rates, and commodity forward prices, and therefore are classified as Level 2.

Marketable Securities

—Marketable securities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded equity securities and equity index funds, and most U.S. Government debt securities, as
these securities all have quoted prices in active markets. Marketable securities utilizing Level 2 inputs include non-auction rate asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds. These securities are valued using market corroborated
pricing, matrix pricing, or other models that utilize observable inputs such as yield curves.

We have classified our
auction rate securities portfolio as utilizing Level 3 inputs, as their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities. These valuations
may be revised in future periods as market conditions evolve. These securities were valued as of December 31, 2008 considering several factors, including the credit quality of the securities, the rate of interest received since the failed
auctions began, the yields of securities similar to the underlying auction rate securities, and the input of broker-dealers in these securities.

Other Investments

—Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include our holdings in certain investment partnerships. These partnership holdings do not have any quoted prices,
nor can they be valued using inputs based on observable market data. These investments are valued internally using a discounted cash flow model based on each partnership’s financial statements and cash flow projections.

Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets

—As of December 31, 2008, we had $18.265 billion of net fixed assets, the
most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets
and the cash flows generated by these assets.

In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual
experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing
market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted
for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.

In accordance with the provisions of FAS 144, we review long-lived assets for
impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair
value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. We review long-lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the
lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. The circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the
market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business.
Adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. This situation would lead to an excess of a particular
aircraft type, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense).

We continually monitor our aircraft fleet utilization in light of current and projected volume levels, aircraft fuel prices, and other factors. Changes in any of these factors, including a continuation of the rapid
economic



decline experienced in the second half of 2008, could result in modifications to our current aircraft fleet plan. Such modifications could result in a
reduction in the expected useful life of an aircraft type or in impairment losses related to the early retirement of particular aircraft.

As a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007, including capacity-optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned
delivery dates, we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses. The review was completed in March 2007, and based on the
results of our evaluation, we accelerated the planned retirement of certain Boeing 727 and 747 aircraft, and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of $221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007.

During 2006, we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our Boeing 757, Boeing 767, and Airbus A300 fleets, and as a result of this evaluation,
increased the depreciable lives from 20 to 30 years and reduced the residual values from 30% to 10% of original cost. This change did not have a material effect on our results of operations.

Income Taxes

—We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and
judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue
and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent
period.

We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our
provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our
consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In the first quarter of 2007,
we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of SFAS No. 109” (“FIN 48”), and related guidance (see Note 13 in the consolidated financial statements). As a
result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of
available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit
as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these
uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in
recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

Accounts
Receivable

—We utilize the reserve method for recognizing bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable. This requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet
date. These estimates require consideration of historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions, trends in customer payment frequency, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present economic
conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors. Our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations



of risk. Continued deterioration in macro economic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly
higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts. Our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $155 and $163 million, respectively. Our total provision for
doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $277, $225, and $159 million, respectively.

Forward-Looking Statements

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and other parts of this report contain “forward-looking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. The words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “we see,”
and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described
some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the
forward-looking statements.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do
not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps.

The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate
risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves,
and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses
presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from
the market shifts modeled

.

A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided
in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline. Currently, the fuel surcharges that we apply
to our domestic and international package and LTL services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes. Additionally, we use a combination of options contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy
prices. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was an asset (liability) of $0 and $(179) million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of
these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $0 and $42 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the
price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we terminated several energy
derivatives and received $87 million in cash. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash. These transactions are reported in other investing activities in the statement of
cash flows. As these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting, were designated as hedges, and maintained their effectiveness, the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges. The hedges that
were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008 will be recognized in the income statement through the first quarter of 2009.

Foreign Currency Exchange
Risk

We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the
local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures
relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted
foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 24 months. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset (liability) of $241 and $(42) million, respectively. The potential loss in
fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $239 and $387 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This sensitivity analysis



assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change
in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.

Interest Rate
Risk

As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have issued debt instruments, including debt associated with
capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and
floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest
payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. We also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances. The net fair value of
our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was a liability of $388 and $94 million, respectively.

Our floating rate debt
and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short-term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in short-term interest rates
applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments (excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances) at December 31, 2008 and 2007 would be approximately $41 and $100 million, respectively.

We have investments in debt and preferred equity securities (including auction rate securities), as well as cash-equivalent instruments, some of which
accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at December 31,
2008 and 2007 would be approximately $6 and $15 million, respectively.

Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. The potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our
variable rate finance receivables at December 31, 2008 and 2007 would be immaterial.

This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes
interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these
estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions.

Equity Price Risk

We hold investments in various
common equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair value of such investments was $30 and $35 million, respectively.
The potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $3 and $4 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Credit Risk

The forward contracts, swaps, and
options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to financial
institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any material losses as a result of counterparty default.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Shareowners

United Parcel Service, Inc.

Atlanta, Georgia

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of United Parcel Service, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of United Parcel Service, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008, and the related statements
of consolidated income, comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008 and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

United Parcel Service, Inc.

Atlanta, Georgia

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of United Parcel Service, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of United Parcel Service Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As described in Notes 1, 5, and 13 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109),” on
January 1, 2007, the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” on January 1, 2006, and the recognition and disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)),” on December 31, 2006.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

NOTE 1.
SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Financial Statements and Business Activities

The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of United Parcel Service, Inc., and all of its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively
“UPS” or the “Company”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

UPS concentrates its
operations in the field of transportation services, primarily domestic and international letter and package delivery. Through our Supply Chain & Freight subsidiaries, we are also a global provider of specialized transportation, logistics,
and financial services.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

U.S. Domestic and International Package Operations

—Revenue is recognized upon delivery of a letter or package, in accordance with EITF 91-9
“Revenue and Expense Recognition for Freight Services in Process”.

Forwarding and Logistics

—Freight forwarding
revenue and the expense related to the transportation of freight is recognized at the time the services are performed, and presented in accordance with EITF 99-19 “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent”. Material
management and distribution revenue is recognized upon performance of the service provided. Customs brokerage revenue is recognized upon completing documents necessary for customs entry purposes.

Freight

—Revenue is recognized upon delivery of a less-than-truckload (“LTL”) or truckload (“TL”) shipment, in accordance
with EITF 91-9.

—Income on loans and direct finance leases is recognized on the effective interest method.
Accrual of interest income is suspended at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days delinquent. Income on operating leases is recognized on the straight-line method over the terms of
the underlying leases.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash. We consider securities with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The
carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Restricted cash and
cash equivalents relate to our self-insurance requirements. In 2008, we entered into an escrow agreement with an insurance carrier to guarantee our self-insurance obligations. This agreement required us to provide $191 million in collateral to the
insurance carrier, which is classified as “other non-current assets” on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008, and in “other investing activities” in the cash flow statement. This restricted cash is invested
in money market funds and similar cash equivalent type assets.

Marketable Securities

Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with related unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), a
separate component of shareowners’ equity. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion is included in investment income, along with
interest and dividends. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method; realized gains and losses resulting from such sales are included in investment income.

Investment securities are reviewed for impairment in accordance with FASB Statement No. 115 “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities” and FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) 115-1 “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.” We periodically review our investments for indications of other than
temporary impairment considering many factors, including the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value has been less than its cost, overall economic and market conditions, and the financial condition and specific prospects for the
issuer. Impairment of investment securities results in a charge to income when a market decline below cost is other than temporary.

Accounts Receivable

We utilize the reserve method for recognizing bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable. This requires us to make our
best estimate of the probable losses in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date. These estimates consider historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions, trends in customer payment frequency, and judgments about the probable
effects of relevant observable data, including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors.

Our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $155 and $163 million, respectively. Our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and
2006 was $277, $225, and $159 million, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets, which are as follows: Vehicles—5 to 15 years; Aircraft—12 to 30 years; Buildings—20 to 40 years; Leasehold Improvements—terms of leases; Plant Equipment—6 to 10 years; Technology Equipment—3 to 5 years.
The costs of major airframe and engine overhauls, as well as routine maintenance and repairs, are charged to expense as incurred. During 2006, we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our Boeing 757, Boeing 767, and Airbus A300 fleets, and as
a result of this evaluation, increased the depreciable lives from 20 to 30 years and reduced the residual values from 30% to 10% of original cost. This change did not have a material effect on our results of operations.

Interest incurred during the construction period of certain property, plant and equipment is capitalized until the underlying assets are placed in
service, at which time amortization of the capitalized interest begins, straight-line, over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Capitalized interest was $48, $67, and $48 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with
the provisions of FASB Statement No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we review long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to
be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. We review long-lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the
asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Costs of purchased businesses in excess of net assets acquired (goodwill), and intangible assets are accounted for under the provisions of FASB Statement
No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”). Under FAS 142, we are required to test all goodwill for impairment at least annually, unless changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred
sooner. We are required to test goodwill on a “reporting unit” basis. A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, for businesses within that operating segment, discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by
management, in which case such a component business is the reporting unit.

A fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment.
An impairment charge is recognized for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. We primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model, and supplement this with
observable valuation multiples for comparable companies, as applicable.

Finite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, licenses,
patents, customer lists, non-compete agreements, and franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 2 to 20 years. Capitalized software is amortized over periods ranging from 3
to 5 years.

Self-Insurance Accruals

We self-insure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we
will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels, which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and
expected levels of cost per claim.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“FAS 109”). FAS 109 is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, FAS 109 generally considers all expected future
events other than proposed changes in the tax law or rates. Valuation allowances are provided if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by
determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate
and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible
outcomes. We reevaluate these



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes
in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

Foreign Currency Translation

We translate the
results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries using average exchange rates during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of each period. Balance sheet currency translation adjustments are
recorded in AOCI. Net currency transaction gains and losses included in other operating expenses were pre-tax gains of $46, $26, and $23 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation is accounted for under FASB Statement No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”). FAS 123(R), which was adopted on January 1, 2006 using the modified-prospective transition method, requires all share-based awards to employees to be measured based on
their fair values and expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period). Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based compensation under the recognition and
measurement provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”. We issue employee share-based awards under the UPS Incentive Compensation Plan that are subject to specific vesting conditions; generally,
the awards cliff vest or vest ratably over a five year period, “the nominal vesting period,” or at the date the employee retires (as defined by the plan), if earlier. For awards that specify an employee vests in the award upon retirement,
we accounted for the awards using the nominal vesting period approach prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R). Under this approach, we record compensation expense over the nominal vesting period. If the employee retires before the end of the nominal
vesting period, any remaining unrecognized compensation expense is recorded at the date of retirement.

Upon our adoption of FAS 123(R), we
revised our approach to apply the non-substantive vesting period approach to all new share-based compensation awards. Under this approach, compensation cost is recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or over the
period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period. We continue to apply the nominal vesting period approach for any awards granted prior to January 1, 2006,
and for the remaining portion of the then unvested outstanding awards.

If we had accounted for all share-based compensation awards granted
prior to January 1, 2006 under the non-substantive vesting period approach, the impact to our net income and earnings per share would have been immaterial for all prior periods.

Derivative Instruments

Derivative instruments are accounted for in accordance with FASB Statement
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS 133”), as amended, which requires all financial derivative instruments to be recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives not
designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If a derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in its fair value that are considered to be effective, as defined, either offset the change
in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through income, or are recorded in AOCI until the



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

hedged item is recorded in income. Any portion of a change in a derivative’s fair value that is considered to be ineffective, or is excluded from the
measurement of effectiveness, is recorded immediately in income.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2007, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 06-11, “Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment
Awards.” EITF 06-11 requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units, which are expected to vest, be recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 is applied prospectively for tax
benefits on dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. We adopted the provisions of EITF 06-11 beginning in the first quarter of 2008. This adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or
financial condition.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R) “Business Combinations” (“FAS
141(R)”). FAS 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition); establishes the
acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs; and requires the acquirer to disclose in its financial statements the
information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. FAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact of
FAS No. 141(R) on our consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (“FAS 160”).
FAS 160 requires reporting entities to present noncontrolling (minority) interests as equity (as opposed to as a liability or mezzanine equity) and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests.
As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $5 million in noncontrolling interests classified in other non-current liabilities. FAS 160 applies prospectively as of January 1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements
which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, “Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“FAS 161”), which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of
accounting for such instruments under FAS 133 and its related interpretations, and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. We adopted FAS 161
on January 1, 2009. FAS 161 only impacts our disclosures, and does not impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. These new disclosures will be required for us beginning in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
March 31, 2009.

In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset
When the Market for That Asset is Not Active” (“FSP 157-3”). FSP 157-3 clarifies the application of FAS 157, which we adopted as of January 1, 2008, in cases where a market is not active. We have considered the guidance provided
by FSP 157-3 in our determination of estimated fair values as of December 31, 2008, and the impact was not material.

In December
2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosure about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets”, which amends Statement 132(R) to require more detailed disclosures about employers’ pension plan assets. New disclosures
will include more information on investment strategies, major categories of assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

assets. This new standard requires new disclosures only, and will have no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows. These new disclosures will be required for us beginning in our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009.

Changes in Presentation

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

NOTE 2. MARKETABLE SECURITIES

The following is a
summary of marketable securities classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2008 and 2007 (in millions):



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The gross realized gains on sales of marketable securities totaled $19, $23, and $12 million in 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively. The gross realized losses totaled $10, $9, and $21 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Impairment losses recognized on marketable securities and short-term investments totaled $23 million during 2008
(discussed further below), with no such losses recognized in 2007 or 2006.

At December 31, 2008, we held $287 million in principal
value of investments in auction rate securities. Some of these investments take the form of debt securities, and are structured as direct obligations of local governments or agencies (classified as “U.S. State and local municipal
securities”). Other auction rate security investments are structured as obligations of asset-backed trusts (classified as “Asset-backed debt securities”), generally all of which are collateralized by student loans and are guaranteed
by the U.S. Government or through private insurance. The remaining auction rate securities take the form of preferred stock, and are collateralized by securities issued directly by large corporations. Substantially all of our investments in auction
rate securities maintain ratings of A / A1 or higher by Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively.

During the first quarter
of 2008, market auctions, including auctions for substantially all of our auction rate securities portfolio, began to fail due to insufficient buyers. As a result of the persistent failed auctions, and the uncertainty of when these investments could
successfully be liquidated at par, we have classified all of our investments in auction rate securities to non-current marketable securities (which are reported in “Other Non-Current Assets” on the consolidated balance sheet), as noted in
the table above, as of December 31, 2008. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned at each respective reset date until the auction succeeds, the issuer redeems the securities, or the
securities mature.

Historically, the par value of the auction rate securities approximated fair value due to the frequent resetting of the
interest rate. While we will continue to earn interest on these investments in failed auction rate securities (often at the maximum contractual interest rate), the estimated fair value of the auction rate securities no longer approximates par value
due to the lack of liquidity. We estimated the fair value of these securities after considering several factors, including the credit quality of the securities, the rate of interest received since the failed auctions began, the yields of securities
similar to the underlying auction rate securities, and the input of broker-dealers in these securities. As a result, we recorded an after-tax unrealized loss of approximately $47 million on these securities as of December 31, 2008 in other
comprehensive income ($71 million pre-tax), reflecting the decline in the estimated fair value of these securities.

During the third
quarter of 2008, we recorded impairment losses on two auction rate securities that were collateralized by preferred stock issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(“FHLMC”). The impairment followed actions by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Housing Finance Agency with respect to FNMA and FHLMC. Additionally, we recorded impairment losses on a municipal auction rate security and on
holdings of several medium term notes issued by Lehman Brothers Inc., which declared bankruptcy during the third quarter. We do not hold any other securities issued by these entities. The total of these credit-related impairment losses during the
year was $23 million, which was recorded in “investment income” on the income statement.

For the remaining auction rate
securities and other debt securities, we have concluded that no additional other-than-temporary impairment losses existed as of December 31, 2008. In making this determination, we considered the financial condition and prospects of the issuer,
the magnitude of the losses compared with the investments’ cost, the length of time the investments have been in an unrealized loss position, the probability that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the contractual terms of
the security, the credit rating of the security, and our ability and intent to hold these investments until the anticipated recovery in market value occurs.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table presents the age of gross unrealized losses and fair value by investment category
for all securities in a loss position as of December 31, 2008 (in millions):

The unrealized losses in the U.S. state and local municipal securities, preferred equity
securities, and mortgage and asset-backed securities primarily relate to the auction rate securities discussed previously. The unrealized losses for the non-auction rate securities within those categories are primarily related to various fixed
income securities, and are primarily due to changes in market interest rates. We have both the intent and ability to hold the securities contained in the previous table for a time necessary to recover the cost basis.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities and short-term investments at December 31, 2008, by contractual maturity, are
shown below (in millions). Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

NOTE 3. FINANCE RECEIVABLES

The following is a summary of finance receivables at December 31, 2008 and 2007 (in millions):



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Outstanding receivable balances at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are net of unearned income of $26
and $30 million, respectively.

When we “factor” (i.e., purchase) a customer invoice from a client, we record the customer
receivable as an asset and also establish a liability for the funds due to the client, which is recorded in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet. The following is a reconciliation of receivable factoring balances at December 31,
2008 and 2007 (in millions):

The carrying value of finance receivables at December 31, 2008, by contractual maturity, is
shown below (in millions). Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers have the right to prepay these receivables without prepayment penalties.

Based on interest rates for financial instruments with similar terms and maturities, the estimated
fair value of finance receivables is approximately $957 and $895 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $885 million, consisting of standby letters of credit
of $136 million and other unfunded lending commitments of $749 million.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE 4. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment as of December 31 consists of the following (in millions):

As a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007, including
capacity-optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates, we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain
the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses. The review was completed in March 2007, and based on the results of our evaluation, we accelerated the planned retirement of certain Boeing 727 and 747
aircraft, and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of $221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007. This charge is included in the caption “Other expenses” in the Statements of Consolidated Income, of
which $159 million impacted our U.S. Domestic Package segment and $62 million impacted our International Package segment. No impairments of aircraft or other long-lived assets were recognized in 2008 or 2006.

We continually monitor our aircraft fleet utilization in light of current and projected volume levels, aircraft fuel prices, and other factors. Changes
in any of these factors, including a continuation of the rapid economic decline experienced in the second half of 2008, could result in modifications to our current aircraft fleet plan. Such modifications could result in a reduction in the expected
useful life of an aircraft type or in impairment losses related to the early retirement of particular aircraft.

NOTE 5. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

We sponsor various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit and defined contribution plans which cover our employees
worldwide. In the U.S. we maintain the following defined benefit pension plans: UPS Retirement Plan, UPS Pension Plan, UPS IBT Pension Plan, and one non-qualified plan, the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan.

We also sponsor various defined benefit plans covering certain of our International employees. The majority of our International obligations are for
defined benefit plans in Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition, many of our International employees are covered by government-sponsored retirement and pension plans. We are not directly responsible for providing benefits to participants of
government-sponsored plans.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The UPS Retirement Plan is noncontributory and includes substantially all eligible employees of
participating domestic subsidiaries who are not members of a collective bargaining unit, as well as certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on average compensation
levels earned by employees prior to retirement. Benefits payable under this plan are subject to maximum compensation limits and the annual benefit limits for a tax qualified defined benefit plan as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service.

The UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain eligible participants in the UPS
Retirement Plan for amounts that exceed the benefit limits described above.

The UPS Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes certain
eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries and members of collective bargaining units that elect to participate in the plan. This plan provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.
Additionally, retirement benefits for certain participants are determined by an earnings-based formula.

We also sponsor postretirement
medical plans in the U.S. that provide health care benefits to our retirees who meet certain eligibility requirements and who are not otherwise covered by multi-employer plans. Generally, this includes employees with at least 10 years of service who
have reached age 55 and employees who are eligible for postretirement medical benefits from a Company-sponsored plan pursuant to their domestic subsidiary company or collective bargaining agreements. We have the right to modify or terminate certain
of these plans. These benefits have been provided to certain retirees on a noncontributory basis; however, in many cases, retirees are required to contribute all or a portion of the total cost of the coverage.

Our national master agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”) allowed us, upon ratification, to withdraw
employees from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (“Central States Pension Fund”), a multi-employer pension plan, and to establish a jointly trusteed single-employer plan (“UPS IBT Pension Plan”) for
this group of employees. We recorded a pre-tax charge of $6.100 billion to establish our withdrawal liability upon ratification of the national master agreement, and made a $6.100 billion payment to the Central States Pension Fund in December 2007.
In connection with the national master agreement and upon establishment of the UPS IBT Pension Plan, we restored certain benefit levels to our employee group within the new plan, which resulted in the initial recognition of a $1.701 billion pension
liability and a corresponding $1.062 billion reduction of AOCI and $639 million reduction of long-term deferred tax liabilities.

The
withdrawal liability was based on computations performed by independent actuaries employed by the Central States Pension Fund, in accordance with the plan document and the applicable requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (“ERISA”). We negotiated our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund as part of our national master agreement with the Teamsters, which included other modifications to hourly wage rates, healthcare and pension benefits, and
work rules. We sought to negotiate our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, as we believed the fund would likely continue to have funding challenges, and would present a risk to UPS of having to face higher future contribution
requirements and a risk to the security of the pension benefits of those UPS employees who participated in the fund. We believe that we benefited financially from the ability to achieve a ratified national master agreement seven months before the
expiration of the previous agreement, as well as by gaining better control over the future cost and funding of pension benefits by limiting our obligations solely to UPS Teamster employees through the new UPS IBT Pension Plan. As the UPS IBT Pension
Plan matures, we believe that it will become cost beneficial from a cash flow and earnings standpoint compared with having remained in the Central States Pension Fund.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
132(R))” (“FAS 158”). This statement requires us to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet, and required delayed recognition items,



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits, to be recognized in other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized to
the income statement. On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158, which resulted in a reduction to AOCI of $2.097 billion and a reduction of long-term deferred tax liabilities of $1.258 billion.

Additionally, we previously utilized the early measurement date option available under Statement No. 87 “Employers’
Accounting for Pensions”, and we measured the funded status of our plans as of September 30 each year. Under the provisions of FAS 158, we were required to use a December 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement
benefit plans beginning in 2008. As a result of this change in measurement date, we recorded a cumulative effect after-tax $44 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008.

Net Periodic Benefit Cost

Information about
net periodic benefit cost for the pension and postretirement benefit plans is as follows (in millions):

Actuarial Assumptions

The table below provides the weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost.

The table below provides the weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit
obligations of our plans.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions
and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” These assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, mortality rates, and other factors. Actuarial
assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis.

A discount rate is used to determine the present value of our future benefit obligations. For
plans in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., the discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows to a yield curve based on long-term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date. In 2008, a
modification was made to the population from which the bond portfolio was chosen. We believe this change more closely approximates the population from which we would select bonds to settle our pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations.
This particular change had an impact of raising the discount rate on average 23 and 17 basis points for the pension benefits and postretirement medical benefits, respectively. Each basis point increase in the discount rate decreases the projected
benefit obligation by approximately $24 million and $3 million for pension and postretirement medical benefits, respectively. For all other plans outside the U.S., the discount rate is selected based on high quality fixed income indices available in
the country in which the plan is domiciled. These assumptions are updated each year.

An assumption for return on plan assets is used to
determine the expected return on asset component of net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal year. This assumption for our U.S. plans was developed using a long-term projection of returns for each asset class, and taking into consideration our
target asset allocation. For our U.S. plans, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is the foundation for all other asset class returns, and various risk premiums are added to determine the expected return for each allocation.

For the UPS Retirement Plan, we use a market-related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses. Investment gains or losses are the
difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets. This method recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility in
pension expense. Our expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.

For plans outside the U.S., consideration is given to local market expectations of long-term returns. Strategic asset allocations are determined by country, based on the nature of liabilities and considering the demographic composition of
the plan participants.

Health care cost trends are used to project future postretirement benefits payable from our plans. For year-end
2008 obligations, future postretirement medical benefit costs were forecasted assuming an initial annual increase of 8.0%, decreasing to 5.0% by the year 2014 and with consistent annual increases at that ultimate level thereafter.

Assumed health care cost trends have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the U.S. postretirement medical plans. A one-percent change in
assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (in millions):

Benefit Obligations and Fair Value of Plan Assets

The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the plans’ benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets as of the respective
measurement dates in each year (in millions). The measurement date for 2007 was September 30. Under the provisions of FAS 158, we began to use a December 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans beginning
in 2008.

Funded Status

The following table discloses the funded status, as of the respective measurement dates in each year, of our plans and the amounts recognized in our balance sheet as of December 31, on a pre-tax basis (in
millions):

The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans as of the measurement dates in 2008 and
2007 was $15.301 and $14.419 billion, respectively.

Employer contributions and benefits paid under the pension plans include $24 and $19
million paid from employer assets in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Employer contributions and benefits paid (net of participant contributions) under the postretirement medical benefit plans include $81 and $80 million paid from employer assets in
2008 and 2007, respectively.

As a result of losses experienced in the global equity markets, our U.S. domestic pension plans experienced a
negative return on assets of approximately 26% in 2008. This negative return on assets, combined with a change in the discount rate, will increase pension costs by approximately $121 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The negative return on assets
also had a significant adverse impact on shareowners’ equity in 2008, as the unrealized pension losses reduced AOCI by $3.717 billion, after-tax.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

At the respective measurement dates in 2008 and 2007, the projected benefit obligation, the
accumulated benefit obligation, and the fair value of plan assets for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets were as follows (in millions):

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation exceeds plan assets for all of our U.S.
postretirement benefit plans.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

The amounts in AOCI expected to be amortized and recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost in 2009 are as follows (in millions):

Plan Asset Investment Policy

The asset allocation for our U.S. pension and other postretirement plans as of the respective measurement dates in 2008 and 2007, and the target
allocation as of December 31, 2008, by asset category, are as follows:



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Equity securities include UPS Class A shares of common stock in the amounts of $338 million
(2.6% of total plan assets) and $460 million (2.5% of total plan assets), as of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively.

The applicable benefit plan committees establish investment guidelines and strategies, and regularly monitor the performance of the funds and portfolio managers. Our investment strategy with respect to pension assets is to invest the assets
in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The long-term primary objectives for our pension assets are to (1) provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital, without undue exposure to risk; and protect the assets from
erosion of purchasing power, and (2) provide investment results that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarially assumed long-term rate of return.

Expected Cash Flows

Information about expected cash flows for the pension and postretirement benefit plans is as
follows (in millions):

Expected benefit payments for pensions will be primarily paid from plan trusts. Expected benefit
payments for postretirement medical benefits will be paid from plan trusts and corporate assets. Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute amounts annually that are at least equal to the amounts required by applicable laws and regulations,
or to directly fund payments to plan participants, as applicable. International plans will be funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions will be made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations
of the plans.

Other Plans

We
also contribute to several multi-employer pension plans for which the previous disclosure information is not determinable. Amounts charged to operations for pension contributions to these multi-employer plans were $1.069, $7.642, and $1.405 billion
during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The 2007 amount includes the $6.100 billion payment to withdraw from the Central States Pension Fund, as previously discussed.

We also contribute to several multi-employer health and welfare plans that cover both active and retired employees for which the previous disclosure information is not determinable. Amounts charged to operations for
contributions to multi-employer health and welfare plans were $990, $919, and $862 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We also sponsor several defined contribution plans for all employees not covered under collective
bargaining agreements, and for certain employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. The Company matches, in shares of UPS common stock or cash, a portion of the participating employees’ contributions. Matching contributions charged
to expense were $116, $128, and $113 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In early 2009, we suspended the company matching contributions to the primary employee defined contribution plan.

Contributions are also made to defined contribution money purchase plans under certain collective bargaining agreements. Amounts charged to expense were
$78, $72, and $62 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

NOTE 6. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The following table indicates the allocation of goodwill by reportable segment (in millions):

The goodwill acquired in the International Package segment during 2008 was due to our purchase of
a package delivery company in Romania and our buyout of a joint venture in Korea. The operating results of these acquired businesses are not material to the International Package segment. The currency / other balance includes the translation effect
on goodwill from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, as well as escrow reimbursements and the resolution of certain tax contingencies from acquisitions completed previously.

We test our goodwill for impairment annually, as of October 1

st

, on a reporting unit basis in accordance with FAS 142. Our reporting units are comprised of the Europe, Asia, and Americas reporting units in the
International Package reporting segment, and the Forwarding & Logistics, UPS Freight, MBE / UPS Store, and UPS Capital reporting units in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment. The impairment test involves a two-step
process. First, a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values, including goodwill, is performed. We primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model,
and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies, as applicable. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to
determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our UPS Freight reporting unit, which was formed
through the acquisition of Overnite Corporation in 2005, had a goodwill impairment of $548 million which is included in the caption “other expenses” in the consolidated



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

income statement. This impairment charge resulted from several factors, including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time
for the LTL sector, and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar LTL industry participants. At the time of acquisition of Overnite Corporation, LTL equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger. We
invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance, as well as expand service offerings. However, this process took longer than initially anticipated, and thus financial results have been below our
expectations. Additionally, the LTL sector in 2008 has been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the U.S., lower industrial production and retail sales, volatile fuel prices, and significant levels of price-based competition. By the
fourth quarter of 2008, the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit, leading to the goodwill impairment charge. None of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in 2008,
nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in 2007 or 2006.

The following is a summary of intangible assets at December 31, 2008
and 2007 (in millions):

All of our recorded intangible assets other than goodwill are deemed to be finite-lived
intangibles, and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives. In accordance with FAS 144, impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the
intangible may not be recoverable. As a result of weak performance in our domestic package operations in the United Kingdom, we reviewed our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment within our U.K. domestic package entity.
Based on recent performance and near-term projections, the value assigned to a customer list intangible asset acquired within the U.K. domestic package business was determined to be impaired. This was the result of both higher than anticipated
customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with an acquired business. Accordingly, an intangible asset impairment charge of $27 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008, which is included in the caption
“Other expenses” in the consolidated income statement.

Amortization of intangible assets was $202, $236, and $255 million during
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Expected amortization of finite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2008 for the next five years is as follows (in millions): 2009—$197; 2010—$138; 2011—$77; 2012—$20;
2013—$17. Amortization expense in future periods will be affected by business acquisitions, software development, and other factors.

NOTE 7. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

In December 2004, we agreed with Sinotrans Air Transportation Development Co., Ltd. (“Sinotrans”) to acquire direct control of the international
express operations in 23 cities within China, and to purchase Sintotrans’ interest in our current joint venture in China. As of December 31, 2006, we had made all cash payments under the purchase agreement, a total of $114 million, and had
taken direct control of operations in all 23 locations. The operations acquired are reported within our International Package reporting segment.

Pro forma results of operations have not been presented for this acquisition because the effects of this transaction were not material. The results of operations are included in our statements of consolidated income from the date of
acquisition. The purchase price allocations of acquired companies can be modified up to one year after the date of acquisition. No purchase price adjustments were made during 2008.

NOTE 8. DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS

Debt obligations, as of December 31, consist of the
following (in millions):

8.38% Debentures:

On January 22, 1998, we exchanged $276 million of an original $700 million in debentures for new debentures of equal principal with a maturity of April 1, 2030. The new debentures have the same interest rate
as the 8.38% debentures due 2020 until April 1, 2020, and, thereafter, the interest rate will be 7.62% for the final 10 years. The 2030 debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at our option at any time. The redemption price is equal to
the greater of 100% of the principal amount and accrued interest, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payout of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption at a benchmark treasury yield plus five basis
points plus accrued interest. The remaining $424 million of 2020 debentures are not subject to redemption prior to maturity. Interest is payable semiannually on the first of April and October for both debentures and neither debenture is subject to
sinking fund requirements. The fixed obligations associated with the debentures were previously swapped to floating rates, based on six month LIBOR plus a spread. Including the effect of the swaps, the average interest rate paid on the debentures
for 2007 was 7.99%. The swaps were subsequently terminated, and the average interest rate paid on the debt in 2008 was 8.38%.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

4.50%, 5.50%, and 6.25% Senior Notes:

In January 2008, we completed an offering of $1.750 billion of 4.50% senior notes due January 2013, $750 million of 5.50% senior notes due January 2018,
and $1.500 billion of 6.20% senior notes due January 2038. All of the notes pay interest semiannually, and allow for redemption of the notes by UPS at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a “make-whole” amount, plus
accrued interest. After pricing and underwriting discounts, we received a total of $3.961 billion in cash proceeds from the offering. The proceeds from the offering were used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance.

Commercial Paper:

The weighted average
interest rate on the commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, was 0.55% and 4.36%, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, we have classified $1.0 billion of this commercial paper balance as long-term debt, based on
our intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis, with the remaining $1.922 billion classified as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2007, we had classified $4.0 billion of our commercial
paper balance as long-term debt, due to the issuance of fixed rate notes subsequent to December 31, 2007. The amount of commercial paper outstanding in 2009 is expected to fluctuate. We are authorized to borrow up to $10.0 billion under the
U.S. commercial paper program we maintain as of December 31, 2008. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €1.0 billion in a variety of currencies, however no amounts were
outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2008.

Floating Rate Senior Notes:

The floating rate senior notes bear interest at one-month LIBOR less 45 basis points. The average interest rates for 2008 and 2007 were 2.48% and 4.85%,
respectively. These notes are callable at various times after 30 years at a stated percentage of par value, and putable by the note holders at various times after 10 years at a stated percentage of par value. The notes have maturities ranging from
2049 through 2053.

Capital Lease Obligations:

We have certain aircraft subject to capital leases. Some of the obligations associated with these capital leases have been legally defeased. The recorded value of aircraft subject to capital leases, which are included
in Property, Plant and Equipment is as follows as of December 31 (in millions):

Facility Notes and Bonds:

We have entered into agreements with certain municipalities to finance the construction of, or improvements to, facilities that support our U.S. Domestic Package and Supply Chain & Freight operations in the United States. These
facilities are located around airport properties in Louisville, KY; Dallas, TX; Philadelphia,



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

PA; and Dayton, OH. Under these arrangements, we enter into a lease or loan agreement that covers the debt service obligations on the bonds issued by the
municipalities, as follows:

•

Bonds with a principal balance of $149 million issued by the Louisville Regional Airport Authority associated with our Worldport facility in Louisville, KY. The
bonds, which are due in January 2029, bear interest at a variable rate, and the average interest rates for 2008 and 2007 were 1.86% and 3.62%, respectively.

•

Bonds with a principal balance of $43 million issued by the Louisville Regional Airport Authority associated with our air freight facility in Louisville, KY. The
bonds were issued in November 2006 and are due in November 2036. The bonds bear interest at a variable rate, and the average interest rates for 2008 and 2007 were 2.11% and 3.62%, respectively.

•

Bonds with a principal balance of $29 million issued by the Dallas / Forth Worth International Airport Facility Improvement Corporation associated with our Dallas,
TX airport facilities. The bonds are due in May 2032 and bear interest at a variable rate, however the variable cash flows on the obligation have been swapped to a fixed 5.11%.

•

Bonds with a principal balance of $100 million issued by the Delaware County, Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority associated with our Philadelphia, PA
airport facilities. The bonds, which are due in December 2015, bear interest at a variable rate, and the average interest rates for 2008 and 2007 were 1.75% and 3.54%, respectively.

•

Bonds with a principal balance of $108 million issued by the city of Dayton, OH associated with our Dayton airport facility, $62 million of which is due in 2009 and
the remaining $46 million is due in 2018. The balance due in 2018 became callable beginning in 2008. The bond principal due in 2018 bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.63%, while the bond principal due in 2009 bears interest at fixed rates ranging
from 6.05% to 6.20%.

UPS Notes:

The UPS Notes program involves the periodic issuance of fixed rate notes in $1,000 increments with various terms and maturities. At December 31, 2008, the coupon rates of the outstanding notes varied between
3.00% and 6.00%, and the interest payments are made either monthly, quarterly or semiannually. The maturities of the notes range from 2009 to 2027. Substantially all of the fixed obligations associated with the notes were swapped to floating rates,
based on different LIBOR indices plus or minus a spread. The average interest rate payable on the swaps for 2008 and 2007 was 2.48% and 4.83%, respectively.

Pound Sterling Notes:

The Pound Sterling notes were issued in 2001 with a principal balance of
£500 million, accrue interest at a 5.50% fixed rate, and are due on February 12, 2031. In May 2007, we completed an exchange offer for the existing notes. Holders of £434 million of the notes accepted the exchange offer,
and as a result, these notes were exchanged for new notes with a principal amount of £455 million, bearing interest at 5.13% and due in February 2050. The new notes are callable at our option at a redemption price equal to the greater of
100% of the principal amount and accrued interest, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payout of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption at a benchmark U.K. government bond yield plus 15 basis
points and accrued interest. The £66 million of existing notes that were not exchanged continue to bear interest at 5.50% and are due in 2031. We accounted for the exchange in accordance with EITF 96-19 “Debtor’s Accounting for
a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments”, and as such, no gain or loss was recognized upon the completion of this transaction.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Other Debt:

The other debt balance primarily relates to loans entered into in conjunction with our investment in various partnerships. Substantially all of this debt is classified as a current liability. The implied interest
rates on this debt range from 3.20% to 6.43%.

Other Information

Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for long-term debt with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt,
including current maturities, is approximately $10.287 and $11.238 billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We lease
certain aircraft, facilities, equipment and vehicles under operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2055. Certain of the leases contain escalation clauses and renewal or purchase options. Rent expense related to our operating leases
was $834, $896, and $912 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

The following table sets forth the aggregate minimum lease
payments under capital and operating leases, the aggregate annual principal payments due under our long-term debt, and the aggregate amounts expected to be spent for purchase commitments (in millions).

As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $2.132
billion issued in connection with our self-insurance reserves and other routine business requirements. We also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances, and as of December 31, 2008, we had $262 million of
surety bonds written.

We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. One of these agreements provides revolving credit
facilities of $4.5 billion, and expires on April 16, 2009. The second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion, and expires on April 19, 2012. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged
at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities.

Our existing
debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. These covenants limit the



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

amount of secured indebtedness that may be incurred by the company, and limit the amount of sale-leaseback transactions that the company may engage in, to
10% of net tangible assets each. As of December 31, 2008 and for all prior periods, we have satisfied these financial covenants. As of December 31, 2008, 10% of net tangible assets is equivalent to $2.156 billion, however we have no
qualifying sale-leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding. We do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity.

NOTE 9. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES

We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in
state and federal courts containing various class-action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which was certified as a class action in a California federal court in June 2004, plaintiffs allege that they
improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,300 full-time supervisors. In August 2005, the court granted summary judgment
in favor of UPS on all claims, and plaintiff appealed the ruling. In October 2007, the appeals court reversed the lower court’s ruling. In April 2008, the Court decertified the class and vacated the trial scheduled for April 29, 2008. We
have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

In another case, Hohider v. UPS, which in
July 2007 was certified as a class action in a Pennsylvania federal court, plaintiffs have challenged certain aspects of the Company’s interactive process for assessing requests for reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities
Act. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of over 35,000 current and former employees, and seek back-pay, and compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. In August 2007, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the
Company’s Petition to hear the appeal of the trial court’s certification order. Oral argument took place in November 2008. The appeal will likely take one year. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to
vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
of operations, or liquidity.

UPS and Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. are defendants in various lawsuits brought by franchisees who operate Mail
Boxes Etc. centers and The UPS Store locations. These lawsuits relate to the rebranding of Mail Boxes Etc. centers to The UPS Store, The UPS Store business model, the representations made in connection with the rebranding and the sale of The UPS
Store franchises, and UPS’s sale of services in the franchisees’ territories. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any
liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

UPS Freight, along with several other companies involved in the LTL freight business, is a defendant in a Multi-District Litigation pending in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The lawsuits allege that the defendants conspired to fix fuel surcharge rates, and they seek injunctive relief, treble damages and attorneys’ fees. We have denied any liability with
respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases, and defendants’ motion to dismiss is pending for decision by the Court. These cases are at a preliminary stage and at this time, we have not determined the amount
of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe
that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 260,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. In September 2007,
we reached a new national master agreement with the Teamsters, which was ratified in December 2007. The new agreement provides for wage increases as well as contributions to healthcare and pension plans, and most economic provisions of the new five
year agreement took effect on August 1, 2008, with the exception of our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund which occurred in 2007. We have approximately 2,900 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the
Independent Pilots Association, which becomes amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable in November 2006. We began formal negotiations with
Teamsters Local 2727 in October 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers (approximately 3,000). These agreements run through July 31, 2009.

We participate in a number of trustee-managed
multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment
performance, changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
of operations, or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans.

NOTE 10. SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY

Capital Stock, Additional Paid-In Capital, and Retained Earnings

We maintain two classes of common stock, which are distinguished from each other by their respective voting rights. Class A shares of UPS are entitled to 10 votes per share, whereas Class B shares are entitled to
one vote per share. Class A shares are primarily held by UPS employees and retirees, and these shares are fully convertible into Class B shares at any time. Class B shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the
symbol “UPS.” Class A and B shares both have a $0.01 par value, and as of December 31, 2008, there were 4.6 billion Class A shares and 5.6 billion Class B shares authorized to be issued. Additionally, there are
200 million preferred shares, with no par value, authorized to be issued; as of December 31, 2008, no preferred shares had been issued.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following is a rollforward of our common stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings
accounts (in millions, except per share amounts):

On January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”, which resulted in a reduction to retained earnings of $104 million (discussed further in Note 13). On January 1, 2008, we recognized a $44 million
reduction to retained earnings as a result of changing our measurement date under FAS 158, which is discussed further in Note 5. Also on January 1, 2008, we recognized a $16 million reduction to retained earnings as a result of adopting FAS
159, which is discussed further in Note 16.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we repurchased a total of 53.6,
35.9, and 32.6 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock for $3.558, $2.618, and $2.455 billion, respectively. In January 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase authority to $10.0 billion.
Unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our Board, the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

We incur activity in AOCI for unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized
gains and losses from derivatives that qualify as hedges of cash flows, and unrecognized pension and postretirement benefit costs. The activity in AOCI is as follows (in millions):

As discussed in Note 5, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158 on
December 31, 2006. The adoption of FAS 158 required us to eliminate the previous minimum pension liability charge to AOCI, and to record a charge, net of tax, to AOCI representing the unrecognized pension and postretirement benefit costs as of
December 31, 2006.

Deferred Compensation Obligations and Treasury Stock

We maintain a deferred compensation plan whereby certain employees were previously able to elect to defer the gains on stock option exercises by deferring
the shares received upon exercise into a rabbi trust. The shares held in this trust are classified as treasury stock, and the liability to participating employees is classified as “deferred compensation obligations” in the
shareowners’ equity section of the balance sheet. The number of shares needed to settle the liability for deferred compensation obligations is included in the denominator in both



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Employees are generally no longer able to defer the gains from stock options exercised subsequent to
December 31, 2004. Activity in the deferred compensation program for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 is as follows (in millions):

NOTE 11. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Incentive Compensation Plan

The UPS Incentive Compensation Plan permits the grant of nonqualified
stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units, and management incentive awards to eligible employees. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the Incentive
Compensation Plan is 112 million, with the number of shares reserved for issuance as restricted stock limited to 34 million. As of December 31, 2008, management incentive awards, stock options, restricted performance units, and restricted
stock units had been granted under the Incentive Compensation Plan.

Management Incentive Awards & Restricted Stock Units

Persons earning the right to receive management incentive awards are determined annually by the Compensation Committee of the UPS Board of Directors. Our
management incentive awards program provides that half of the annual management incentive award, with certain exceptions, be made in restricted stock units (“RSUs”), which generally vest over a five-year period. The other half of the award
is in the form of cash or unrestricted shares of class A common stock and is fully vested at the time of grant. These management incentive awards are generally granted in the fourth quarter of each year.

Upon vesting, RSUs result in the issuance of the equivalent number of UPS class A common shares after required tax withholdings. Except in the case of
death, disability, or retirement, RSUs granted for our management incentive awards generally vest over a five year period with approximately 20% of the award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant. The entire grant is expensed on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period. All RSUs granted are subject to earlier cancellation or vesting under certain conditions. Dividends earned on management incentive award RSUs are reinvested in additional RSUs at each dividend
payable date.

We also award RSUs in conjunction with our long-term incentive performance awards program to certain eligible employees. The
RSUs ultimately granted under the long-term incentive performance award are based



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

upon the achievement of certain performance measures, including growth in consolidated revenue and operating return on invested capital, each year during the
performance award cycle, and other measures, including growth in consolidated earnings, over the entire three year performance award cycle.

As of December 31, 2008, we had the following nonvested RSUs outstanding, including reinvested dividends:

The fair value of each RSU is the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) closing price on the
date of grant. The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $46.56, $74.94, and $74.87, respectively. The total fair value of RSUs vested was $141, $145, and $82 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. As of December 31, 2008, there was $633 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years and 7 months.

Nonqualified Stock Options

We maintain fixed stock
option plans, under which options are granted to purchase shares of UPS class A common stock. Stock options granted in connection with the Incentive Compensation Plan must have an exercise price at least equal to the NYSE closing price of UPS class
B common stock on the date the option is granted.

Persons earning the right to receive stock options are determined each year by the
Compensation Committee. Except in the case of death, disability, or retirement, options granted under the Incentive Compensation Plan prior to 2008 are generally exercisable three to five years from the date of grant and before the expiration of the
option 10 years after the date of grant. Beginning in 2008, option awards will be made to a more limited group of employees, and options granted will generally vest over a five year period with approximately 20% of the award vesting at each
anniversary date of the grant. All options granted are subject to earlier cancellation or exercise under certain conditions. Option holders may exercise their options via the tender of cash or class A common stock, and new class A shares are issued
upon exercise. Options granted to eligible employees will generally be granted annually during the second quarter of each year at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following is an analysis of options to purchase shares of class A common stock issued and
outstanding:

The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
weighted average assumptions used, by year, and the calculated weighted average fair values of options are as follows:

Expected volatilities are based on the historical returns on our stock and the implied volatility
of our publicly-traded options. The expected dividend yield is based on the recent historical dividend yields for our stock, taking into account changes in dividend policy. The risk-free interest rate is based on the term structure of interest rates
at the time of the option grant. The expected life represents an estimate of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding, and we have relied upon a combination of the observed exercise behavior of our prior grants with similar
characteristics, the vesting schedule of the grants, and an index of peer companies with similar grant characteristics.

We received cash
of $46, $52, and $30 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, from option holders resulting from the exercise of stock options. We received a tax benefit of $4, $9, and $12 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, from the
exercise of stock options. The adoption of FAS 123(R) required us to change the statement of cash flow classification of these tax benefits, and as a result, these tax benefits are reported as cash from financing activities rather than cash from
operating activities.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $13, $31, and $45 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2008, there was $49 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2 years and 7 months.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at
December 31, 2008:

Restricted Performance Units

We issue restricted performance units (“RPUs”) under the Incentive Compensation Plan. Upon vesting, RPUs result in the issuance of the equivalent number of UPS class A common shares after required tax
withholdings. Persons earning the right to receive RPUs are determined each year by the Compensation Committee. Except in the case of death, disability, or retirement, all RPUs granted prior to 2008 vest five years after the date of grant. Beginning
in 2008, RPU awards granted will generally vest over a five year period with approximately 20% of the award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant. All RPUs granted are subject to earlier cancellation or vesting under certain conditions.
Dividends earned on RPUs are reinvested in additional restricted performance units at each dividend payable date. RPUs granted to eligible employees will generally be granted annually during the second quarter of each year at the discretion of the
Compensation Committee.

As of December 31, 2008, we had the following nonvested RPUs outstanding, including reinvested dividends:

The fair value of each RPU is the NYSE closing price on the date of grant. The weighted-average
grant date fair value of RPUs granted during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $71.06, $70.90, and $80.88, respectively. The total fair value of RPUs vested during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $83, $19, and $13 million, respectively. As of December 31,
2008, there was $170 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RPUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years and 6 months.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Discounted Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We maintain an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Under the plan, shares of UPS class A common stock may be purchased at quarterly
intervals at 90% of the lower of the NYSE closing price of UPS class B common stock on the first or the last day of each quarterly period. Employees purchased 1.9, 1.8, and 1.9 million shares at average prices of $55.27, $64.20, and $66.64 per
share during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Compensation cost is measured for the fair value of employees’ purchase rights under our discounted employee stock purchase plan using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In 2009, we modified
the employee stock purchase plan whereby shares of UPS class A common stock are now purchased at 95% of the NYSE closing price of UPS class B common stock on the last day of each quarterly period. Under the provisions of FAS 123(R), no compensation
cost will be measured for the modified employees’ purchase rights.

The weighted average assumptions used and the calculated weighted
average fair value of employees’ purchase rights granted, are as follows:

*

Includes the 10% discount from the market price.

Expected volatilities are based on the historical price volatility on our publicly-traded class B shares. The expected dividend yield is based on the recent historical dividend yields for our stock, taking into account changes in dividend
policy. The risk-free interest rate is based on the term structure of interest rates on U.S. Treasury securities at the time of the option grant. The expected life represents the three month option period applicable to the purchase rights.

NOTE 12. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We report our operations in three segments: U.S. Domestic Package operations, International Package operations, and Supply Chain & Freight operations. Package operations represent our most significant business and are broken down
into regional operations around the world. Regional operations managers are responsible for both domestic and export operations within their geographic area.

U.S. Domestic Package

Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents, and packages
throughout the United States.

International Package

International Package operations include delivery to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or distribution
outside the United States. Our International Package reporting segment includes the operations of our Europe, Asia, and Americas operating segments.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Supply Chain & Freight

Supply Chain & Freight includes our forwarding and logistics operations, UPS Freight, and other aggregated business units. Our forwarding and logistics business provides services in more than 175 countries
and territories worldwide, and includes supply chain design and management, freight distribution, customs brokerage, mail and consulting services. UPS Freight offers a variety of LTL and TL services to customers in North America. Other aggregated
business units within this segment include Mail Boxes, Etc. (the franchisor of Mail Boxes, Etc. and The UPS Store) and UPS Capital.

In
evaluating financial performance, we focus on operating profit as a segment’s measure of profit or loss. Operating profit is before investment income, interest expense, and income taxes. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are
the same as those described in the summary of accounting policies (see Note 1), with certain expenses allocated between the segments using activity-based costing methods. Unallocated assets are comprised primarily of cash, marketable securities,
short-term investments, and certain real estate investments.

Segment information as of, and for the years ended, December 31 is as

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for the
years ended December 31 consists of the following:

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined
that our UPS Freight reporting unit, which was formed through the acquisition of Overnite Corporation in 2005, had a goodwill impairment of $548 million. The impairment was not deductible for tax purposes and therefore negatively impacted our
effective tax rate in 2008.

During the third quarter of 2006, we recognized a $52 million reduction of income tax expense related to
favorable developments with certain U.S. federal tax contingency matters involving non-U.S. operations.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following at December 31 (in millions):

The valuation allowance changed by $(61), $(13), and $11 million during the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We have U.S. state and local operating loss and credit carryforwards as follows (in
millions):

The operating loss carryforwards expire at varying dates through 2028. The state credits can be
carried forward for periods ranging from three years to indefinitely.

We also have non-U.S. loss carryforwards of approximately $605
million as of December 31, 2008, the majority of which may be carried forward indefinitely. As indicated in the table above, we have established a valuation allowance for certain non-U.S. and state loss carryforwards, due to the uncertainty
resulting from a lack of previous taxable income within the applicable tax jurisdictions.

Undistributed earnings of our non-U.S.
subsidiaries amounted to approximately $1.842 billion at December 31, 2008. Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. federal or state deferred income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon
distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes and withholding taxes payable in various non-U.S. jurisdictions, which could potentially be offset by foreign tax credits. Determination
of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 requires that we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related
appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial
statements. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of adopting this standard was to recognize a $104 million decrease in the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.

The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):

The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 that, if
recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $206 million and $189 million, respectively. We also had gross recognized tax benefits of $583 million and $567 million recorded as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, associated with
outstanding refund claims for prior tax years. Therefore, we had a net receivable recorded with respect to prior year income tax matters in the accompanying balance sheets. Additionally, we have recognized a receivable for interest of $135 million
and $116 million for the recognized tax benefits associated with outstanding refund claims as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Our continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties associated with income
tax matters as a component of income tax expense.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, most U.S. state and local
jurisdictions, and many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2008, we had substantially resolved all U.S. federal income tax matters for tax years prior to 1999. In February and July 2008, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
completed its audit of the tax years 1999 through 2002 and tax years 2003 through 2004, respectively, with only a limited number of issues that will be considered by the IRS Appeals Office by the end of 2009. In late 2008, the IRS began the initial
planning phase of the income tax audit for tax years 2005 through 2007. Along with this audit for tax years 2005 through 2007, the IRS is currently examining non-income based taxes, including employment and excise taxes on transportation of property
by air and fuel purchases, which could lead to proposed assessments. The IRS has not presented an official position with regard to these taxes at this time, and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment;
however, we do not believe that the



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

resolution of this matter would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. With few exceptions, we are
no longer subject to U.S. state and local and non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years prior to 1999, but certain U.S. state and local matters are subject to ongoing litigation.

A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and ultimately settled. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the
timing of resolution for uncertain tax positions. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. Items that may cause changes to unrecognized tax
benefits include the timing of interest deductions and the allocation of income and expense between tax jurisdictions. These changes could result from the settlement of ongoing litigation, the completion of ongoing examinations, the expiration of
the statute of limitations, or other unforeseen circumstances. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change cannot be made.

NOTE 14. EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in
millions except per share amounts):

Diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 exclude the
effect of 11.7, 8.9, and 6.3 million shares, respectively, of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of employee stock options because such effect would be antidilutive.

NOTE 15. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

We are exposed to market risk, primarily related
to foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and interest rates. These exposures are actively monitored by management. To manage the volatility relating to certain of these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative financial
instruments. Our objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and interest rates. It is our policy and
practice to use



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures. As we use price sensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of our
existing and anticipated transactions, we expect that any loss in value for those instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of those hedged transactions.

We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Commodity Price Risk Management

We are exposed to
changes in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline. Currently, the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and LTL services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse
fuel price changes. Additionally, we use a combination of options contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007 was an asset (liability) of $0 and $(179) million, respectively. We have designated and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges, and to the extent the hedges remain effective, the resulting gains and losses
from these hedges are recognized in the income statement when the underlying fuel or energy product being hedged is consumed.

In the
fourth quarter of 2008, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $87 million in cash. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash. These transactions are
reported in “other investing activities” in the statement of cash flows. As these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting, were designated as hedges, and maintained their effectiveness, the gains associated with these hedges were
recognized in income over the original term of the hedges. The hedges that were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008 will be recognized in the income statement through the first quarter of 2009.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Management

We have
foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values
of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling, and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written
options and forward contracts to hedge currency cash flow exposures. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset (liability) of $241 and $(42) million, respectively. We have
designated and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated revenue and, therefore, the resulting gains and losses from these hedges are recognized as a component of international package revenue when
the underlying sales occur.

Interest Rate Risk Management

Our indebtedness under our various financing arrangements creates interest rate risk. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of
our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the
notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. We also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt
issuances.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We have designated and account for these contracts as either hedges of the fair value of the
associated debt instruments, or as hedges of the variability in expected future interest payments. Any periodic settlement payments are accrued monthly, as either a charge or credit to interest expense, and are not material to net income. The net
fair value of our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was a liability of $388 and $94 million, respectively.

Concurrent
with the issuance of $4.0 billion in long-term fixed rate notes in January 2008, as discussed further in Note 8, we settled certain derivatives that were designated as hedges of the borrowing costs of the notes offering, resulting in a cash outflow
of $84 million (which is reported in “other financing activities” on the cash flow statement). This amount is amortized into expense as an adjustment to the effective yield over the life of the individual bonds that were hedged.

Credit Risk Management

The forward
contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to
financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any material losses as a result of counterparty default.

Income Effects of Derivatives

In the context of hedging relationships, “effectiveness” refers to the degree to
which fair value changes in the hedging instrument offset corresponding changes in the hedged item. Certain elements of hedge positions cannot qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133 whether effective or not, and must therefore be marked to
market through income. Both the effective and ineffective portions of gains and losses on hedges are reported in the income statement category related to the hedged exposure. Ineffectiveness included in the income statement was a loss of $12 million
for 2007, and was immaterial for 2008 and 2006. The elements excluded from the measure of effectiveness were immaterial for 2008, 2007 and 2006.

As of December 31, 2008, $191 million in pre-tax gains related to cash flow hedges that are currently deferred in AOCI are expected to be reclassified to income over the 12 month period ending December 31, 2009. The actual amounts
that will be reclassified to income over the next 12 months will vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. No amounts were reclassified to income during 2008 in connection with forecasted transactions that were no longer
considered probable of occurring.

At December 31, 2008, the maximum term of derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions
was 18 months.

NOTE 16. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted Statement No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”), which requires disclosures about our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. Further information
about such assets and liabilities is presented below. We have not applied the provisions of FAS 157 to non-financial assets, such as our property and equipment, goodwill and certain other assets, which are measured at fair value for impairment
assessment, nor to any business combinations or asset retirement obligations. We began to apply the provisions of FAS 157 to these assets and liabilities beginning January 1, 2009, in accordance with FASB Staff Position No. 157-2,
“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”.



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“FAS 159”), which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value (i.e., the fair value option), on an
instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. The election to use the fair value option is available at specified election dates, such as when an entity first recognizes a
financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment. Subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. Additionally, FAS 159 allows for a one-time election for existing positions upon adoption, with the
transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings. We adopted FAS 159 on January 1, 2008, and elected to apply the fair value option to our investment in certain investment partnerships that were previously accounted for under the
equity method. Accordingly, we recorded a $16 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008, representing the cumulative effect adjustment of adopting FAS 159. These investments are reported in “other non-current
assets” on the consolidated balance sheet.

Our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value have been categorized based upon a fair
value hierarchy in accordance with FAS 157. Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are based on other observable market data, such as quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rates and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions, and include situations where there is little or no
market activity for the asset or liability.

The following is a general description of the valuation methodologies used for financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value, including the general classification of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

Marketable Securities –

Marketable securities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded equity securities and equity index funds, and most U.S. Government debt securities, as these
securities all have quoted prices in active markets. Marketable securities utilizing Level 2 inputs include non-auction rate asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds. These securities are valued using market corroborated
pricing, matrix pricing, or other models that utilize observable inputs such as yield curves.

We have classified our auction rate
securities portfolio as utilizing Level 3 inputs, as their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities. These valuations may be
revised in future periods as market conditions evolve. These securities were valued as of December 31, 2008 considering several factors, including the credit quality of the securities, the rate of interest received since the failed auctions
began, the yields of securities similar to the underlying auction rate securities, and the input of broker-dealers in these securities.

Derivative Contracts –

Our foreign currency, interest rate, and energy derivatives are largely comprised of over-the-counter derivatives, which are primarily valued using pricing models that rely on market observable
inputs such as yield curves, currency exchange rates, and commodity forward prices, and therefore are classified as Level 2.

Other
Investments—

Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include our holdings in certain investment partnerships. These partnership holdings do not have any quoted prices, nor can they be valued using inputs based on
observable market data. These investments are valued internally using a discounted cash flow model based on each partnership’s financial statements and cash flow projections.

NOTE 17. RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND RELATED EXPENSES

In connection with recent acquisitions and integration initiatives, we have incurred restructuring costs associated with the termination of employees,
facility consolidations and other costs directly related to the restructuring initiatives implemented. These costs have resulted from the integration of our Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Lynx acquisitions as well as restructuring activities
associated with our Supply Chain Solutions operations. For specific restructuring costs recognized in conjunction with the cost from acquisitions, we have accounted for these costs in accordance with EITF 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities
Assumed in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination.” All other restructuring costs have been accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” and SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”

Lynx Express Ltd.

In conjunction with our integration of the Lynx business, in 2006 we implemented a series of initiatives to reduce operating costs and maximize the
efficiencies of the UPS network in the United Kingdom. These initiatives included closing existing hubs and constructing a consolidated sorting facility as well as establishing a



UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

European shared service center in Poland. As a result of these initiatives, we accrued certain costs related to employee severance, lease terminations and
other facility costs, and recorded a reduction in the fair value of certain assets acquired. The restructuring costs that impacted the acquired Lynx business resulted in an adjustment to goodwill of $7 million in 2006. The remaining integration
costs for this restructuring program, including facility costs associated with capacity expansion, were recognized as expense when incurred. We completed this integration program in 2008, at which time certain hubs were closed and the new
consolidated sorting facility became fully operational.

Supply Chain Solutions

In an effort to rationalize our cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth, we initiated a restructuring plan for our Supply Chain Solutions
forwarding & logistics operations in the fourth quarter of 2006. This restructuring involved a reduction of non-operating expenses by approximately 20%, including a reduction in non-operating staff of approximately 1,400 people. During
2006, $12 million in costs were accrued related to employee severance.

In the third quarter of 2007, we initiated a restructuring plan for
our forwarding and logistics operations in France. The objective of this restructuring plan was to reduce our forwarding and logistics cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in the Europe region. The restructuring principally
consisted of an employment reduction program which included a voluntary termination phase followed by an involuntary termination phase. The employment reduction program was ratified by our company’s trade union representatives in France in July
2007 and communicated to employees immediately following the ratification. Employees participating in this program are entitled to severance benefits, including certain bonuses for employees participating in the voluntary termination phase. These
severance benefits are formula-driven and are in accordance with French statutory laws as well as the applicable collective bargaining agreements. The employment reduction program resulted in 103 employees accepting the voluntary termination offer
and 342 positions being subject to the involuntary termination program. The restructuring also included costs incurred related to contract terminations for leased facilities, vehicles and equipment as well as impairment charges associated with
long-lived assets. We recorded a restructuring charge of $42 million related to severance costs and $4 million for impairments and other contract termination costs in the third quarter of 2007. This restructuring plan was completed during 2008.

UPS Special Voluntary Separation Opportunity

In December 2006, we offered a special voluntary separation opportunity (“SVSO”) to approximately 640 employees who work in non-operating functions. This program was established to improve the efficiency of non-operating processes
by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company. The SVSO ended in February 2007, and 195, or 30% of eligible employees, accepted the offer. As a result, we recorded a charge to expense of $68 million in the first quarter of
2007, to reflect the cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits under the SVSO program. The cash payout related to this program totaled $28 million and $35 million during 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The $68 million charge was included in the caption “Compensation and benefits” in the Statement of Consolidated Income, of which $53 million impacted our U.S. Domestic Package segment, $8 million impacted our Supply
Chain & Freight segment, and $7 million impacted our International Package segment.

NOTE 18. QUARTERLY INFORMATION (unaudited)

Fourth quarter 2008 operating profit includes the goodwill impairment charge of $548 million in
our Supply Chain & Freight segment and the intangible asset impairment charge of $27 million in our International Package segment, as discussed in Note 6. There were no tax benefits related to these two charges, therefore fourth quarter
2008 net income was reduced by $575 million, which reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.58.

First quarter 2007 operating
profit includes the aircraft impairment charge of $221 million as discussed in Note 4 ($159 million U.S. Domestic Package and $62 million International Package), and the SVSO charge of $68 million as discussed in Note 17 ($53 million U.S. Domestic
Package, $7 million International Package, and $8 million Supply Chain & Freight). The after-tax impact of these two charges reduced first quarter 2007 net income by $184 million, which reduced basic earnings per share by $0.17, and diluted
earnings per share by $0.18.

Third quarter 2007 operating profit includes the $46 million charge related to the restructuring of our
France forwarding and logistics operations within our Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment, as discussed in Note 17. The after-tax impact of this charge reduced third quarter 2007 net income by $31 million, which reduced basic and
diluted earnings per share by $0.03.

Fourth quarter 2007 operating profit includes the $6.100 billion charge in the U.S. Domestic Package
segment related to the withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, as discussed in Note 5. The after-tax impact of this charge reduced fourth quarter 2007 net income by $3.772 billion, which reduced basic earnings per share by $3.60 and diluted
