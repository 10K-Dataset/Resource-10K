PART I

Item  1.

Business

Overview

We are the world’s largest express carrier, the
world’s largest package delivery company and a leading
global provider of specialized transportation and logistics
services. We were founded in 1907 as a private messenger and
delivery service in the Seattle, Washington area. Over the past
94 years, we have expanded from a small regional parcel delivery
service into a global company. We deliver packages each business
day for 1.8 million shipping customers to six million
consignees. In 2000, we delivered an average of more than 13.6
million pieces per day worldwide. Total revenue in 2000 was over
$29.7 billion. We focus on the movement of goods, information
and funds, and we seek to position ourselves as the world’s
premier enabler of global commerce.

Our primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages
and documents throughout the United States and in over 200 other
countries and territories. We have established a vast global
transportation infrastructure and developed a comprehensive
portfolio of guaranteed delivery services, and we support these
services with advanced technology. We provide logistics
services, including integrated supply chain management, for
major companies worldwide. We are the industry leader in the
delivery of goods purchased over the Internet.

Competitive Strengths

We have the following competitive strengths:

Global Reach and Scale.

We believe that our integrated
global ground and air network is the most extensive in the
industry. We operate more than 150,000 vehicles and over 600
airplanes. In the U.S., we estimate that our integrated
door-to-door delivery system carries goods having a value in
excess of 6% of the U.S. gross domestic product, and we reach
all U.S. businesses and residential addresses. We have invested
billions of dollars in information technology, a fleet of
airplanes and sorting facilities across our vast global delivery
network. Based on number of jet aircraft operated, we are the
ninth largest airline in North America. Our primary air hub is
located in Louisville, Kentucky.

We established our first international operation in Canada in
1975, and we established a domestic operation in West Germany in
1976. In the 1980s and early 1990s, we expanded our operations
throughout Europe as the single market created by the European
Union drove the need for pan-European delivery services. Today,
we have what we believe is the most comprehensive integrated
delivery and information services portfolio of any carrier in
Europe, and we offer a broad portfolio of time-definite
services, ranging from same-day delivery to logistics solutions
for total supply chain management.

In the last decade, we created more than two dozen alliances
with Asian delivery companies to supplement company-owned
operations, and we currently serve more than 40 Asia Pacific
countries and territories. In January 2001, the U.S. Department
of Transportation awarded us rights to fly directly from the
U.S. to China. We began direct service from the U.S. to China in
April 2001.

We also have operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, and
we are positioned to capitalize upon the growth potential in
those regions. Through our 2000 acquisition of the assets and
air routes of Challenge Air Cargo, we have become the largest
air cargo carrier in Latin America. Our 2000 acquisition of
Comlasa has positioned us as a leading provider of service parts
logistics in Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition, we
have formed alliances with a number of service partners in
countries throughout our Americas region.

Technology Systems.

We have expanded our reputation as a
leading package distribution company by developing an equally
strong capability as a mover of electronic information. In 2000,
we transmitted over 1.3 billion packets of data via wireless
networks, and we currently collect electronic data on over 10.5
million


packages each day — more than any of our competitors.
As a result, we have improved our efficiency and price
competitiveness, and we provide improved customer solutions.

We have made significant investments in technology over the past
decade. Citing UPS as the company making the greatest
advancement in integrating both physical and online business
practices, MIT’s Sloan School of Business awarded UPS its
2000 Clicks & Mortar Award. In ranking UPS second in its
Fast Track 500, eWeek said that UPS “has firmly established
itself as an e-business innovator.” The state-of-the-art
technology that we deploy over our network enables us to serve
our customers globally in the most efficient ways. This
technology provides our customers with total order visibility
and improves customer service, receiving, order management and
accounting operations. Currently, we process approximately 85%
of our domestic volume using a UPS or UPS-compatible shipping
system.

The following are examples of our technology:

E-Commerce Capabilities.

We are a leading participant in
and facilitator of e-commerce, which we define as the use of
networked computer technology to facilitate the buying and
selling of goods and services. According to AMR Research,
Internet-based business-to-business commerce will grow to $5.7
trillion, and 29% of all business to business transactions will
be Internet-based, by 2004. We have teamed with over 100
e-commerce leaders to offer fully integrated Web-enabled
solutions for our customers. In fact, according to ActivMedia,
more than 60% of the top 100 consumer e-commerce websites that
use transportation services are UPS customers.

We have integrated our systems with software produced by leading
manufacturers of enterprise resource planning, Internet
transactions, e-procurement and systems integration solutions.
These solutions give our customers, and our partners’
customers, UPS service options integrated into their websites
and their information technology infrastructures. This
integration allows our customers to lower their package tracking
costs, to improve their collections through closed-loop billing
and to provide better customer service. At the same time, we
gain a competitive advantage as the high-value transportation
solution.

Our website strategy is to provide our customers with the
convenience of all the functions that they otherwise would
perform over the phone or at one of our shipping outlets. Our
site,

www.ups.com,

receives over 40 million hits and
processes over 3.5 million package tracking transactions daily.
This technology allows us to strengthen ties to our customers.
They can easily download our interfaces to UPS transportation
functionality, known as UPS OnLine Tools, to their own websites
for direct use by their customers. This allows users to access
our tools without leaving our customers’ websites. UPS
OnLine Tools include tracking, rates, service selection, address
validation, time-in-transit detail and shipping.

Broad, Flexible Range of Distribution Services.

We offer
to our customers the broadest range of day-definite and
time-definite delivery services in the industry. All of our air,
international and business-to-business ground delivery service
offerings are guaranteed. Our portfolio of services enables
customers to choose the delivery option that is most appropriate
for their requirements.

Our express air services are integrated with our vast ground
delivery system. This integrated air and ground network enhances
pickup and delivery density and provides us with the flexibility
to transport packages using the most efficient and
cost-effective transportation mode or combination of modes. Our
sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our
network efficiency and asset utilization.


We make guaranteed international shipments to more than 200
countries and territories worldwide, including guaranteed
overnight delivery of documents to the world’s major
business centers. We offer a complete portfolio of time-definite
services for customers in major markets.

We pioneered technologies that allow for secure, encrypted and
trackable digital file deliveries over the Internet, such as UPS
OnLine Courier

SM

. To make our services more easily
available and to integrate our presence on the Web wherever
e-commerce is taking place, we have developed a wide range of
Internet tools accessible both from our website and from the
websites of many of our customers. We offer free Internet access
to UPS websites via UPS OnLine World Link. UPS OnLine World Link
enables companies to take advantage of the speed and ease of
online shipping and secure digital document delivery without the
costs and productivity concerns associated with providing full
Internet access.

Our technological capabilities and our broad portfolio of
services have contributed to our volume and revenue growth in
recent years. Our sales and marketing strategies have enabled us
to grow our volume and thereby improve the utilization of our
network. These factors provide us the opportunity to continue to
grow our business in the future.

Customer Relationships.

We serve the ongoing package
distribution requirements of our customers worldwide and provide
additional services that both enhance customer relationships and
complement our position as the world’s premier enabler of
global commerce.

We focus on building and maintaining long-term customer
relationships. We deliver packages each business day for 1.8
million shipping customers to six million consignees. In
addition, thousands of other customers access us daily through
on-call pick-up for air delivery services, about 52,000 letter
drop-boxes, and over 25,000 independently owned authorized
shipping outlets.

We place significant importance on the quality of our customer
relationships and conduct comprehensive market research to
monitor customer perceptions. Since 1993, we have conducted
telephone interviews with shipping decision-makers virtually
every business day to determine their satisfaction with delivery
providers and perception of performance on 17 key categories of
service factors. We use the telephone interview data to develop
a statistical model that identifies those service factors that
have the greatest impact on improving customer satisfaction.
This proprietary Customer Satisfaction Index allows us to
continuously monitor satisfaction levels, to focus our sales and
communications efforts and new service developments, and to
develop process improvement initiatives.

Brand Equity.

We have built strong brand equity as a
leader in quality service and product innovation in our
industry. Among the factors that contribute to our brand equity
are our:

Our brand has successfully made the transition from a U.S.-based
ground delivery company to a global time-definite service
provider with the ability to launch innovative new products and
services around the globe. For example, we were the first
company to offer next-day delivery to every address in the 48
contiguous states and guaranteed next-business day delivery of
packages and documents by 8:00 a.m. or 8:30 a.m. We
also were


the first full-service carrier to introduce same-day delivery
services in the U.S., and the first to provide guaranteed
nationwide ground service in the U.S.

Increasingly, our customers recognize that we are an innovator
of transportation and information-based business solutions on a
broadening global scale. For example, in 2000 we launched UPS
Signature Tracking, which allows customers to electronically
view the actual signature image of the person who signed for a
shipment at a delivery as captured on the delivery driver’s
handheld computer. The information includes the full delivery
address and, if applicable, the C.O.D. amount. We introduced
this service in a secure environment on

www.ups.com

in 13
European countries, the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. UPS
Signature Tracking has caused a significant decline in the
number of phone calls to our customer service centers for these
information requests, with a 25% reduction achieved in December
2000 compared to December 1999.

Distinctive People and Culture.

Our people are our most
valuable asset. We believe that the dedication of our employees
results in large part from our distinctive
“employee-owner” concept. Our employee stock ownership
tradition dates from 1927, when our founders, who believed that
employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful
business, first offered stock to our employees. To facilitate
stock ownership by employees, we maintain several stock-based
compensation programs. Currently, employees and retirees own
about two-thirds of our outstanding class A common stock, and
the founders’ families and foundations own the remaining
shares of class A common stock. These groups continue to own
about 80% of our total outstanding shares and control about 98%
of the voting power of our outstanding stock.

Our long-standing policy of “promotion from within”
complements our tradition of employee ownership, and this policy
has reduced significantly our need to hire managers and
executive officers from outside UPS. A majority of the members
of our management team began their careers as full-time or
part-time hourly UPS employees, and have since spent their
entire careers with us. Our CEO and most of our executive
officers have more than 25 years of service with us and
have accumulated a meaningful ownership stake in our company.
Therefore, our executive officers have a strong incentive to
effectively manage UPS, which benefits all of our shareowners.

Our many community service activities include:


Financial Strength.

Our balance sheet gives us financial
strength that few companies can match. We are one of the few
companies — and the only transportation
company — with a triple-A credit rating from both
Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. This credit rating
reflects the strength of our competitive position, our
consistent earnings and cash flow growth and our conservative
balance sheet. As of December 31, 2000, we had a balance of
cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term
investments of approximately $1.95 billion and shareowners’
equity of $9.74 billion. Long-term debt was $2.98 billion. Our
financial strength has given us the resources to achieve global
scale and to make needed investments in technology and fleet to
facilitate our growth.

Growth Strategy

Our growth strategy is designed to take advantage of our
competitive strengths while maintaining our focus on meeting or
exceeding our customers’ requirements. The principal
components of our growth strategy are as follows:

Build on Our Leadership Position in Our Core Domestic
Business.

Our U.S. package operation is the foundation of
our business and the primary engine for our future growth. We
believe that our tradition of reliable parcel service, our
experienced and dedicated employees and our unmatched delivery
system provide us with the advantages of reputation, service
quality and economies of scale that differentiate us from our
competitors. Our strategy is to increase core domestic revenues
through cross-selling our existing and new services to our large
and diverse customer base, to limit the rate of expense growth
and to employ technology-driven efficiencies to increase
operating profit. Our core business also is a springboard for
our growth in all other areas, including international,
e-commerce, logistics, supply chain management and financial
services. We plan to focus on maintaining and improving service
quality, meeting customer demands and providing innovative
service offerings in order to continue to grow domestic package
revenues.

Continue International Expansion.

We have built a strong
international presence through significant investments over a
number of years. In 2000, our international package operations
generated $4.17 billion of revenue. The international package
delivery market has grown, and continues to grow, at a faster
rate than the U.S. market. We plan to leverage our worldwide
infrastructure and broad product portfolio to continue to
improve our international business mix, to grow high margin
premium services and to implement cost, process and technology
improvements.

Europe, which includes our operations in Africa and the Middle
East, remains our largest regional market outside of the U.S. As
the European Community evolves into a single marketplace, with
well-established regional standards and regulations, we believe
that our business will benefit from additional growth within
Europe as well as continued growth in imports and exports
worldwide. We plan to solidify and expand our market position in
Europe, where we already have created a pan-European network. We
have introduced new aircraft and additional capacity in Europe
to support volume growth and add flexibility to our European air
operations. In addition, we have gained additional operating
rights and enhanced our European hubs. We believe that we have
the strongest portfolio of pan-European services of any
integrated carrier in Europe, combining time-definite delivery
options and related information capabilities. We plan to
continue to expand our service offerings in Eastern Europe and
the Middle East.

We also are investing in our Asian air network to enhance our
operations, and we have developed new multi-million dollar hubs
in Hong Kong and Taiwan. We have acquired operating rights to
provide service to points in Asia and beyond from Tokyo, and we
are seeking to acquire additional air operating authority from a
number of countries. In January 2001, the U.S. Department of
Transportation awarded us rights to fly directly from the U.S.
to China. We began direct service from the U.S. to China in
April 2001.

We believe that there is significant untapped potential for us
to expand our service offerings in Latin America. To this end,
we have introduced overnight delivery between key cities in the
Mercosur and other trade blocs. Most importantly, through our
acquisition of the assets and air routes of Challenge Air Cargo,
we have become the largest air cargo carrier in Latin America.
This position will enable us to further develop our cargo
business and provide advantages in pursuit of additional express
package volume, a market that is less developed in the region.


Provide Comprehensive Supply Chain and Financial Solutions.

Many businesses have decided to outsource the management of
all or part of their supply chains to streamline and gain
efficiencies, to strengthen their balance sheets and to improve
service. We anticipate that there will be further demand for a
global service offering that incorporates transportation,
service parts logistics, and supply chain services with complete
financial support and information services. We believe that we
are well positioned to capitalize on this growth for the
following reasons:

To complement our existing logistics and supply chain solutions,
we are creating a portfolio of financial products and services
that capitalizes on our financial strength, customer
relationships and extensive package-level data on our
customers’ shipments. UPS Capital™ Corporation
provides customers these products and services in a variety of
forms. And in January 2001, we agreed to acquire First
International Bancorp, Inc., which we believe will enable us to
create a powerful combination of financial, shipping and
logistics solutions for customers that will enable them to
better manage their supply chains.

Leverage Our Leading-Edge Technology and E-Commerce
Advantage.

According to research firm eMarketer, online
retail sales will grow 57% during 2001 to $65.9 billion. We
believe that e-commerce will drive smaller and more frequent
shipments and provide a strong complement to our core delivery
service offerings.

Our goal is to integrate our technology into the business
processes of our customers, providing information to assist them
in serving their customers and improving their cash flows. We
also will use our technology and our physical infrastructure to
help provide the operational backbone to businesses striving to
create new business models in e-commerce. These new business
models generally will operate in just-in-time or
manufacturer-direct distribution modes, which are heavily
dependent on smaller, more frequent shipments. In the process,
we will gain knowledge of new repeatable business models and
market this expertise elsewhere. A key component of this
strategy is to expand relationships with technology providers in
areas such as enterprise resource planning, e-procurement and
marketplace solutions, and to integrate our technologies into
their solutions and into the websites and systems of their
customers.

Our leading-edge technology has enabled our e-commerce partners
to integrate our shipping functionality into their e-commerce
product suites. Our partners’ products are being installed
throughout the Internet, and we expect these integrated systems
to provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, the
technology we integrate into our partners’ products creates
significant value for our customers through reduced cycle times,
lower operating costs, improved customer service, enhanced
collections and the ability to offer strong delivery commitments.

Our website at

www.ec.ups.com

supports our commitment to
e-commerce, promotes the advantages of e-commerce and spotlights
our unique position with regard to the facilitation of
e-commerce.


Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Global Alliances.

In
order to remain the preeminent global company in our industry,
we will continue to make strategic acquisitions and enter into
global alliances. Our initial public offering better positioned
us to pursue strategic acquisitions and enter into global
alliances that can:

During 2000, we completed 13 acquisitions, which were
concentrated primarily in the non-package segment and the
customs brokerage industry. In the first quarter of 2001, we
announced three additional acquisition agreements:

•

Fritz Companies, Inc.

On January 10, 2001, we
	announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire Fritz
	Companies, Inc., a global freight forwarding, customs brokerage
	and logistics concern, for approximately $450 million in class B
	common stock. We believe that this acquisition will enable us to
	offer a broad, integrated portfolio of services for moving
	everything from small packages to heavy freight, by any mode of
	transport, anywhere in the world.

•

First International Bancorp, Inc.

On January 16,
	2001, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to
	acquire First International Bancorp, Inc., a provider of
	structured trade finance, commercial and government-backed
	lending products, for approximately $78 million in class B
	common stock. We believe that this acquisition will enable us to
	create a powerful combination of financial, shipping and
	logistics solutions for customers that will enable them to
	better manage their supply chains.

•

Mail Boxes Etc.

On March 2, 2001, we announced that
	we had entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of
	the assets of Mail Boxes Etc., the world’s largest
	franchisor of independently owned and operated business,
	communication and shipping centers, for approximately $191
	million in cash. We believe that this acquisition will allow us
	to develop new opportunities in such areas as small business
	services, e-commerce and financial services.

Each of these transactions is subject to closing conditions, and
each is expected to close during the second quarter of 2001.

Products and Services—Package Operations

Domestic Ground Services

For most of our history, we have been engaged primarily in the
delivery of packages traveling by ground transportation. We
expanded this service gradually, and today standard ground
service is available for interstate and intrastate destinations,
serving every address in the 48 contiguous states and
intrastate in Alaska and Hawaii. We restrict this service to
packages that weigh no more than 150 pounds and are no
larger than 108 inches in length and 130 inches in
combined length and girth. In 1998, we introduced

domestic services that is designed to provide a uniform service
offering across major countries, including

Delivery Service Options

We offer additional services such as Consignee Billing, Delivery
Confirmation and UPS Return Services to those customers who
require customized package distribution solutions. We designed

merchandise from a number of vendors. We bill these consignee
customers directly for their shipping charges, enabling the
customer to obtain tighter control over inbound transportation
costs. Delivery Confirmation provides automatic confirmation and
weekly reports of deliveries and is available throughout the
United States and Puerto Rico. Immediate confirmation is also
available upon request.

regional level, including supply chain network design,
re-engineering and management expertise, leading-edge
information systems and value-added services such as product

executives are assigned to individual operating districts. For
our largest multi-site customers, we have an organization of
regionally based account managers who report directly to our
corporate office.

In addition to our general sales force, we have three
supplemental sales forces. In the U.S., we have an international
business sales force, which is focused on international business
out of major U.S. business centers, and a UPS Hundredweight
Service sales force, which targets LTL volume. Globally, we have
an e-commerce sales team, which focuses on UPS technology
solutions for businesses. Within these specialty sales forces,
account executives report to their respective districts. Our
logistics operations and other subsidiaries maintain their own
sales forces.

Our marketing organization is generally organized along similar
lines. At the corporate level, the marketing group is engaged in
brand management, rate-making and revenue management policy,
market and customer research, product development, product
management, marketing alliances and e-commerce, including the
non-technical aspects of our Web presence. Advertising, public
relations and most formal marketing communications are centrally
conceived and controlled.

Individual district and region marketing personnel are engaged
in business planning, bid preparation and other revenue
management activities, and in coordinating alignment with
corporate marketing initiatives. Individual regions and
districts may engage in local promotional and public relations
activities pertinent to their locales.


Employees

During 2000, we had approximately 359,000 employees. We recently
were named one of

Fortune

magazine’s “Diversity
Elite — 50 Best Companies for Blacks, Asians and
Hispanics” for the second consecutive year.

As of December 31, 2000, we employed approximately 214,000
of our employees (60% of our total employees) under a national
master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local
unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. These agreements run through July 31, 2002. We
employ the majority of our pilots under a collective bargaining
agreement with the Independent Pilots Association. This
agreement becomes amendable on January 1, 2004. Our airline
mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with
Teamster Local 2727, which becomes amendable July 31, 2001.
The majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under
agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective
bargaining agreements with the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements have various
expiration dates between July 31, 2002 and May 31, 2003.

We believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Competition

We are the largest package distribution company in the world, in
terms of both revenue and volume. We offer a broad array of
services in the package delivery industry and, therefore,
compete with many different companies and services on a local,
regional, national and international basis. Our competitors
include the postal services of the United States and other
nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight
forwarders, air couriers and others. Our major competitors
include Federal Express, the United States Postal Service,
Airborne Express, DHL Worldwide Express, Deutsche Post and TNT
Post Group.

We believe competition increasingly is based on a carrier’s
ability to integrate its distribution and information systems
with its customers’ systems to provide unique
transportation solutions at competitive prices. We rely on our
vast infrastructure and service portfolio to attract and
maintain customers. As we move into logistics and other
non-package areas, we compete with a number of participants in
the logistics, financial services and information technology
industries.

Government Regulation

Both the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation
Administration regulate air transportation services.

The DOT’s authority primarily relates to economic aspects
of air transportation, such as discriminatory pricing,
non-competitive practices, interlocking relations or cooperative
agreements. The DOT also regulates, subject to the authority of
the President of the United States, international routes, fares,
rates and practices, and is authorized to investigate and take
action against discriminatory treatment of United States air
carriers abroad. We are subject to U.S. customs laws and
regulations regarding the import and export of shipments to and
from the U.S. In addition, our customs brokerage entities are
subject to those same laws and regulations as they relate to the
filing of documents on behalf of client importers and exporters.

The FAA’s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of
air transportation, including aircraft standards and
maintenance, personnel and ground facilities. In 1988, the FAA
granted us an operating certificate, which remains in effect so
long as we meet the operational requirements of federal aviation
regulations.

The FAA has issued rules mandating repairs on all Boeing Company
and McDonnell-Douglas Corporation aircraft that have completed a
specified number of flights, and also has issued rules requiring
a corrosion control program for Boeing Company aircraft. Our
total expenditures under these programs for 2000 were about
$11.1 million. The future cost of repairs pursuant to these
programs may fluctuate. All mandated repairs have been
completed, or are scheduled to be completed, within the
timeframes specified by the FAA.


Our ground transportation of packages in the United States is
subject to the DOT’s jurisdiction with respect to the
regulation of routes and to both the DOT’s and the
states’ jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of
safety, insurance and hazardous materials.

We are subject to similar regulation in many non-U.S.
jurisdictions. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S.
government regulation of aviation rights to and beyond non-U.S.
jurisdictions, and non-U.S. customs regulation.

The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created the postal service
as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the
federal government, and vested the power to recommend domestic
postal rates in a regulatory body, the Postal Rate Commission.
We believe that the postal service consistently attempts to set
rates for its monopoly services, particularly first class letter
mail, above the cost of providing these services, in order to
use the excess revenues to subsidize its expedited, parcel,
international and other competitive services. Therefore, we
participate in the postal rate proceedings before the Postal
Rate Commission in an attempt to secure fair postal rates for
competitive services.

Properties

Operating Facilities

We own our headquarters, which are located in Atlanta, Georgia
and consist of about 735,000 square feet of office space on an
office campus.

We also own our 27 principal U.S. package operating facilities,
which have floor spaces that range from about 310,000 to 693,000
square feet. In addition, we have a 1.9 million square foot
operating facility near Chicago, Illinois, which is designed to
streamline shipments between East Coast and West Coast
destinations, and we own or lease about 1,150 additional smaller
package operating facilities in the U.S. The smaller of these
facilities have vehicles and drivers stationed for the pickup of
packages and facilities for the sorting, transfer and delivery
of packages. The larger of these facilities have additional
facilities for servicing our vehicles and equipment and employ
specialized mechanical installations for the sorting and
handling of packages.

We also own or lease almost 600 facilities that support our
international package operations and hundreds of facilities that
support our non-package operations. UPS Logistics Group
maintains facilities with about 10 million square feet of floor
space. We believe that our facilities are adequate to support
our current operations.

Our aircraft are operated in a hub and spokes pattern in the
United States. Our principal air hub in the United States is
located in Louisville, Kentucky, with regional air hubs in
Columbia, South Carolina, Dallas, Texas, Hartford, Connecticut,
Ontario, California, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Rockford,
Illinois. These hubs house facilities for the sorting, transfer
and delivery of packages. Our Louisville, Kentucky hub handles
the largest volume of packages for air delivery in the United
States. Our European air hub is located in Cologne, Germany, and
our Asia-Pacific air hub is located in Taipei, Taiwan. Our
regional air hub in Canada is located in Hamilton, Ontario.

Our new automated sorting facility, “Hub 2000,”
currently is under construction in Louisville, Kentucky. We
expect this new facility, which commenced partial operations in
September 2000, to add efficiency and to increase our hub
capacity by over 40% in Louisville.

Our computer operations are consolidated in a 435,000 square
foot leased facility, the Ramapo Ridge facility, which is
located on a 39-acre site in Mahwah, New Jersey. We have leased
this facility for an initial term ending in 2019 for use as a
data processing, telecommunications and operations facility. We
also own a 175,000 square foot facility located on a 25-acre
site in the Atlanta, Georgia area, which serves as a backup to
the main computer operations facility in New Jersey. This
facility provides production functions and backup capacity in
case a power outage or other disaster incapacitates the main
data center. It also helps us to meet communication needs.


Fleet

Aircraft

The following table shows information about our aircraft fleet
as of December 31, 2000:

We maintain an inventory of spare engines and parts for each
aircraft.

All of the aircraft we own meet Stage III federal noise
regulations and can operate at airports that have aircraft noise
restrictions. We became the first major airline to successfully
operate a 100% Stage III fleet more than three years in advance
of the date required by federal regulations.

During 2000, we took delivery of seven Airbus A300-600 aircraft.
We have firm commitments to purchase 13 Boeing MD-11 aircraft
between 2001 and 2004, two Boeing 767-300 aircraft in 2001, and
83 Airbus A300-600 aircraft between 2001 and 2009. We also have
options to purchase 22 Boeing MD-11 aircraft between 2005
and 2010 and 50 Airbus A300-600 aircraft between 2004 and 2012.

Vehicles

We operate a ground fleet of more than 150,000 vehicles, ranging
from custom built delivery vehicles to large tractors and
trailers, including over 2,000 vehicles operated by subsidiaries
of UPS Logistics Group.

Our ground support fleet consists of over 25,000 pieces of
equipment designed specifically to support our aircraft fleet,
ranging from non-powered container dollies and racks to powered
aircraft main deck loaders and cargo tractors. We also have over
30,000 containers used to transport cargo in our aircraft.

Safety

We promote safety throughout our operations.

Our Automotive Fleet Safety Program is built with the following
components:

•

Selection.

Six out of every seven drivers come from our
	part-time ranks. Therefore, many of our new drivers are familiar
	with our philosophies, policies, practices and training programs.

•

Training.

Training is the cornerstone of our Fleet Safety
	Program. Our approach starts with training the trainer. All
	trainers undergo a rigorous training workshop to ensure that
	they have the skills and motivation to effectively train novice
	drivers. A new driver’s employment includes eight hours of
	classroom “space and visibility” training followed by
	three safety training rides integrated into his or her training
	cycle.


•

Responsibility.

Our operations managers are responsible
	for their drivers’ safety records. We investigate every
	accident. If we determine that an accident could have been
	prevented, we re-train the driver.

•

Preventive Maintenance.

An integral part of our Fleet
	Safety Program is a comprehensive Preventive Maintenance
	Program. Our fleet is tracked by computer to ensure that each
	vehicle is serviced before a breakdown or accident is likely to
	occur.

•

Honor Plan.

A well-defined safe driver honor plan
	recognizes and rewards our drivers when they achieve success. We
	have about 2,700 drivers who have driven for 25 years or
	more without an avoidable accident.

We have a comprehensive health and safety program that is
monitored by our employee-management health and safety
committees. The workplace safety process focuses on employee
conditioning and safety-related habits. We enlist
employees’ help in designing facilities and work processes.

Item  3.

Legal
Proceedings

On August 9, 1999 the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion
unfavorable to UPS regarding a Notice of Deficiency asserting
that we are liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax
years. The Court held that we are liable for tax on income of
Overseas Partners Ltd., a Bermuda company (OPL), which had
reinsured excess value package insurance purchased by our
customers beginning in 1984. The Court held that for the 1984
tax year we are liable for taxes of $31 million on income
reported by OPL, penalties and penalty interest of $93 million
and interest for a total after-tax exposure estimated at
approximately $246 million. In February 2000, the U.S. Tax Court
entered a decision in accord with its opinion.

In addition, during the first quarter of 1999, the IRS issued
two Notices of Deficiency asserting that we are liable for
additional tax for the 1985 through 1987 tax years, and the 1988
through 1990 tax years. The primary assertions by the IRS relate
to the reinsurance of excess value package insurance, the issue
raised for the 1984 tax year. The IRS has based its assertions
on the same theories included in the 1983-1984 Notice of
Deficiency.

The IRS, in an issued report, has taken similar positions for
tax years 1991 through 1994. We expect the IRS to take similar
positions for tax years 1995 through 1999. Based on the Tax
Court opinion, we currently estimate that our total after-tax
exposure for the tax years 1984 through 1999 could be as high as
$2.353 billion. We believe that a number of aspects of the Tax
Court decision are incorrect, and we have appealed the decision
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The
Eleventh Circuit has heard oral arguments. We do not know when
the court will render a decision.

In our second quarter 1999 financial statements, we recorded a
tax assessment charge of $1.786 billion, which included an
amount for related state tax liabilities. The charge included
taxes of $915 million and interest of $871 million. This
assessment resulted in a tax benefit of $344 million related to
the interest component of the assessment. As a result, our net
charge to net income for the tax assessment was $1.442 billion,
increasing our total after-tax reserve at that time with respect
to these matters to $1.672 billion. The tax benefit of
deductible interest is included in income taxes; however, since
none of the income on which this tax assessment is based is our
income, we have not classified the tax charge as income taxes.

We determined the size of our reserve with respect to these
matters in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America based on our estimate
of our most likely liability. In making this determination, we
concluded that it is more likely that we will be required to pay
taxes on income reported by OPL and interest, but that it is not
probable that we will be required to pay any penalties and
penalty interest. If penalties and penalty interest ultimately
are determined to be payable, we would have to record an
additional charge of up to $681 million.

On August 31, 1999, we deposited $1.349 billion, and on
August 8, 2000, we deposited an additional $91 million,
with the IRS related to these matters for the 1984 through 1994
tax years. We included the profit of the excess value package
insurance program, using the IRS’s methodology for
calculating these amounts, for


both 1998 and 1999 in filings we made with the IRS in 1999. In
February 2000, we deposited $339 million with the IRS related to
these matters for the 1995 through 1997 tax years. These
deposits and filings were made in order to stop the accrual of
interest, where applicable, on that amount of the IRS’s
claim, without conceding the IRS’s positions or giving up
our right to appeal the Tax Court’s decision.

After the Tax Court decision, National Union Fire Insurance
Company, a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc.,
notified OPL that effective September 30, 1999, it would
terminate the five underlying policies that provide
shippers’ risk insurance for UPS customers. The termination
of these policies triggered the immediate termination of the
reinsurance agreement between National Union and OPL.

UPS, on behalf of our customers, and National Union agreed on a
restructuring of this program, which became effective
October 1, 1999. Commencing on October 1, 1999,
National Union issued five new policies that include coverage
for UPS customers. Glenlake Insurance Agency, Inc., a licensed
insurance agency formed in 1998 and a wholly owned subsidiary of
UPS Capital Corporation, now offers excess value package
insurance to be issued under the five new polices.

UPS Re Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of UPS, has entered into
a reinsurance agreement under which it will reinsure
substantially all of the risks underwritten by National Union in
exchange for substantially all of the premiums collected. UPS Re
Ltd., is a licensed reinsurance company formed in 1999 to
reinsure risks related to UPS and its subsidiaries. UPS Re Ltd.,
which is domiciled in Bermuda, has elected to be taxed on its
income as part of UPS’s consolidated income tax return for
federal income tax purposes. This revised arrangement should
eliminate the issues considered by the Tax Court in the Notices
of Deficiency relating to OPL for the periods after September
1999.

The IRS has proposed adjustments, unrelated to the OPL matters
discussed above, regarding the allowance of deductions and
certain losses, the characterization of expenses as capital
rather than ordinary, the treatment of certain income, and our
entitlement to the investment tax credit and the research tax
credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years. The proposed
adjustments would result in $15 million in additional income tax
expense. Also, the IRS has issued a report taking a similar
position with respect to some of these issues for each of the
years from 1991 through 1994. This report proposes adjustments
that would result in $155 million in additional income tax
expense. For the 1985 through 1994 tax years, unpaid interest on
these adjustments through 2000 could aggregate up to $368
million, after the benefit of related tax deductions. We expect
that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues.
Specifically, we believe that our practice of expensing the
items that the IRS alleges should have been capitalized is
consistent with the practices of other industry participants.
The IRS may take similar positions with respect to some of these
issues for each of the years 1995 through 2000. The IRS’s
proposed adjustments include penalties and penalty interest. We
believe that the possibility that such penalties and penalty
interest will be sustained is remote. We believe the eventual
resolution of these issues will not result in a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

We have been named as a defendant in 23 lawsuits that seek to
hold us (and, in certain cases, other defendants) liable for the
collection of premiums for excess value package insurance in
connection with package shipments since 1984 (or, in some of the
cases, for shorter time periods). These cases generally claim
that we acted as an insurer in violation of our shipping
contract and without complying with state insurance laws and
regulations, and that the price for excess value package
insurance was excessive. Eighteen of these cases have been
consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district
litigation proceeding (“MDL Proceeding”) before the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. An amended consolidated complaint in the MDL Proceeding
also alleges a violation of the federal RICO statute. Another
complaint in the MDL Proceeding alleges violations of federal
antitrust laws. We are in the process of seeking to have four of
the remaining cases consolidated into the MDL Proceeding. The
other remaining case was remanded from federal court to state
court in Madison County, Illinois and is proceeding independent
of the MDL Proceeding. No class has been certified in any of
these cases. These actions all developed after the
August 9, 1999 Tax Court opinion was rendered. We believe
the allegations in these cases have no merit and intend to
continue to defend them vigorously. The ultimate resolution of
these matters cannot presently be determined.


In November 2000, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, or OSHA, published its final ergonomics standard
which would have required American industry to take expansive
compliance steps in the workplace when an employee reports a
musculoskeletal complaint such as low back pain. If OSHA had
enforced these regulations by seeking the same ergonomic
measures it has advocated in the past under its general
authority to remedy “recognized hazards,” it might
have demanded extensive changes in the physical layout of our
distribution centers as well as the hiring of significant
numbers of additional full-time and part-time employees. Our
competitors, as well as the remainder of American industry, also
would have incurred proportionately comparable costs.

The rule was challenged by a broad coalition of trade
associations and businesses in actions consolidated in the
United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Among other
arguments against the rule, opponents asserted that OSHA did not
comply with the statutory mandate of establishing significant
risk of material health impairment or properly analyze the costs
and benefits of the proposed regulations. We believed that
implementation of the rule would be stayed, that a reviewing
court would reject the rule, or that if ergonomic regulations
resembling this proposal had been sustained by a reviewing court
we would have prevailed in an enforcement proceeding based on
substantial defenses.

OSHA took the position that the cost of compliance with the
proposed regulations would have been only $4.5 billion per year
over a ten-year period for all of American industry. We
maintained that these estimates were unrealistic and estimated
that the cost of compliance could have been significantly
greater, both in initial costs and in incremental annual costs.
We also estimated that such expenditures, if required to be
incurred, would have materially and adversely affected our
financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

Subsequent to December 31, 2000, the United States Senate
and the House of Representatives passed joint resolutions
disapproving the OSHA ergonomics standard and declaring that the
standard shall have no force or effect. President Bush has
signed into law a repeal of the OSHA ergonomics standard. We
anticipate that the legal proceedings described above will be
dismissed as moot.

In addition, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that
arose in the normal course of business. In our opinion, none of
these cases is expected to have a material effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Matters

Our class A common stock is not listed on a national securities
exchange or traded in an organized over-the-counter market. On
November 10, 1999, our class B common stock began to
trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol
“UPS”. The following is a summary of our stock price
activity and declared dividend information subsequent to our
initial public offering on November 10, 1999.


Prior to November 10, 1999, UPS common stock was not listed
on a securities exchange and was not sold in the organized
over-the-counter markets. We would notify our shareowners
periodically of our willingness to purchase a limited number of
shares at specified prices determined by the board of directors.
In determining the share price, the board would consider a
variety of factors, including past and current earnings,
earnings estimates, the ratio of UPS common stock to debt of
UPS, other factors affecting the business and long-range
prospects of UPS, and general economic conditions, as well as
opinions furnished from time to time by investment counselors
acting as independent appraisers.

The following is a summary of the prices at which we have
published notices of our willingness to purchase shares from
January 1, 1999, to November 9, 1999, and dividends
declared during this period.

The policy of our board of directors is to declare dividends
each year out of current earnings. The declaration of future
dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors
in light of all relevant facts, including earnings, general
business conditions and working capital requirements.

As of March 9, 2001, there were 129,753 and 10,280 record
holders of Class A and Class B stock, respectively.

and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Operations

2000 Compared to 1999

The following tables set forth information showing the change in
revenue, average daily package volume and average revenue per
piece, both in dollars or amounts and in percentage terms:


U.S. domestic package revenue increased almost $1.7 billion, or
7.6%, primarily due to volume gains across all product lines,
combined with a 2.7% increase in average revenue per piece,
which was primarily driven by our Ground products. All products
contributed to the revenue increase, with our higher revenue per
piece express (Next Day Air and Deferred) products increasing at
approximately the same rate (8.1% and 8.0% respectively). Our
average daily Ground volume grew at a 4.2% rate for the period,
helping to bring our total U.S. average daily package volume to
almost 12.5 million pieces.

During the first quarter of 2000, we increased rates for
standard ground shipments an average of 3.1% for commercial
deliveries. The ground residential charge continued to be $1.00
over the commercial ground rate, with an additional delivery
area surcharge of $1.50 added to certain less accessible areas.
In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next
Day Air Saver and UPS 2nd Day Air an average of 3.5%. The
surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. did not change.
Rates for international shipments originating in the United
States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide
Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased by
2.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S.
were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic
market.

The increase in international package revenue was due to
double-digit volume growth for both our domestic and export
products, offset by a decline in the revenue per piece for these
products. This decline was primarily due to a decline in the
value of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar that occurred
during 2000. The value of the Euro averaged $0.92 in 2000
compared to $1.07 in 1999. Overall average daily package volume
increased 13.8% for international operations, with our export
products, which had an average revenue per piece in excess of
$30, increasing at 21.5%.

The increase in non-package revenue resulted primarily from the
new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for
our customers as well as continued growth of the UPS Logistics
Group. Revenue for the UPS Logistics Group increased by $250
million, or 32.4%, to over $1 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The new arrangement for providing excess
value package insurance began in the fourth quarter of 1999.
Consequently, this item will have a reduced impact on the
comparability of the revenue for our non-package segment in
future periods.

Operating expenses increased by $2.112 billion, or 9.1%, which
was less than our revenue increase of 10.1%. Compensation and
benefits expenses, the largest component of this increase,
accounted for $1.261 billion of the increase and included a $59
million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2000 relating to
the creation of 4,000 new full-time hourly jobs resulting from
the 1997 Teamsters contract. Other operating expenses increased
$851 million primarily due to higher purchased transportation
costs, higher fuel costs and claims expense associated with the
new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for
our customers. The increase in purchased transportation costs
was primarily due to increased business for our international
and logistics operations. The 40.1% increase in fuel costs from
$681 million to $954 million was due to the increase in fuel
prices during 2000 and the additional fuel usage due to the
growth in our average daily package volume, partially offset by
cost reductions generated by our fuel hedging program. The
increase in other operating expenses of $219 million was
slightly offset by the $49 million gain we recognized in the
first quarter of 2000 from the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing
subsidiary. International operating expenses were favorably
impacted by the decline in the value of the Euro relative to the
U.S. dollar as discussed above.

To offset the increasing fuel costs we have experienced over the
last several quarters and that we expect to continue into the
near future, we implemented a temporary 1.25% fuel surcharge
effective August 7, 2000. Approximately $130 million in
revenue was recorded in 2000 as a result of the surcharge.

Our operating margin, defined as operating profit as a
percentage of revenue, improved from 14.4% during 1999 to 15.2%
during 2000. This improvement continues our recently reported
trends and was favorably impacted by continued product mix
improvements and our continued successful efforts in obtaining
profitable volume growth.


The following table shows the change in operating profit, both
in dollars and in percentage terms:

U.S. domestic package operating profit increased by $423
million, or 12.1%, due to the volume and revenue improvements
discussed previously.

The improvement in the operating profit of our international
package segment of 18.1%, or $42 million, resulted primarily
from increased volume and revenue, and was realized despite
significantly higher fuel costs. This improvement occurred
throughout our international regions. The improvement in
operating profit for this segment would have been $36 million
greater, if the impact of currency fluctuations was excluded.

The increase in non-package operating profit is largely due to
the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance
for our customers, which contributed $183 million of additional
operating profit for the year. Also contributing to the
operating profit improvement was the $49 million gain we
recognized during the first quarter of 2000 from the sale of our
UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary. These improvements were offset
somewhat by start-up costs associated with UPS Logistics
Group’s service parts logistics offering, UPS e-Ventures,
UPS Capital Corporation and other initiatives.

The increase in investment income of $330 million for the period
is primarily due to two factors. First, in the first quarter of
2000, two companies in which our Strategic Enterprise Fund held
investments were acquired by other companies, which caused us to
recognize a gain of $241 million. Second, we earned income on
the $5.3 billion in net IPO proceeds available for investment
prior to the tender offer that was completed in early March 2000
and the $1.2 billion in IPO proceeds that were not utilized for
the tender offer. In 1999, we had the net IPO proceeds available
for investment from mid-November through the end of the year. We
announced a share repurchase program on April 20, 2000 under
which we would utilize up to the remaining $1.2 billion not used
in the tender offer. As of December 31, 2000, approximately
$105 million remained available for share repurchases.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $2.934
billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, compared to net income of
$883 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the prior year.
Our 2000 results reflect the non-recurring items discussed
above, which include the gains on our Strategic Enterprise Fund
investments and the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary,
offset partially by the charge for retroactive costs associated
with creating new full-time jobs from existing part-time
Teamster jobs. Our 1999 results reflect a tax assessment charge
resulting from an unfavorable ruling of the U.S. Tax Court.
Excluding these non-recurring transactions for each of these
years, adjusted net income for 2000 would have been $2.795
billion, an increase in excess of 20% over adjusted 1999 net
income of $2.325 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share
would have increased from $2.04 in 1999 to $2.38 in 2000

Our fourth quarter 2000 results reflected a decline in our
previously reported growth rates for both revenue and average
daily volume. These declines were caused by an overall weakening
of the economy.


1999 Compared to 1998

The following tables set forth information showing the change in
revenue, average daily package volume and average revenue per
piece, both in dollars or amounts and in percentage terms:


U.S. domestic package revenue increased more than $1.6 billion
primarily due to a 4.8% increase in average daily package volume
combined with a 3.2% improvement in revenue per piece. Package
volume growth was experienced in all products, with average
volumes for our Next Day Air and Deferred products growing at
10.8% and 8.8%, respectively. We generated substantial growth in
our Ground revenue, which comprised 64% of our U.S. domestic
package revenue, based on average volume growth of 3.8% and a
2.5% improvement in average revenue per piece.

During the first quarter of 1999, we increased rates for
standard ground shipments an average of 2.5% for commercial
deliveries. The ground residential charge continued to be $1.00
over the commercial ground rate, with an additional delivery
area surcharge added to certain less accessible areas. In
addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day
Air Saver and UPS 2nd Day Air an average of 2.5%, while we
decreased the rate for UPS 2nd Day Air A.M. by 2.2%.
The rate for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. did not change.
Rates for international shipments originating in the United
States did not increase for UPS Worldwide Express, Worldwide
Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International
Standard service. Rate changes for shipments originating outside
the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by
geographic market.

The increase in international package revenue was primarily due
to an overall improvement in product mix, specifically volume
growth for our export products. All international operations
posted double-digit volume growth in export services, with the
largest increases experienced in our Asia Pacific and European
operations. Due to the strong growth of our international export
products, our total average revenue per piece for the
international segment increased $0.72, or 5.8%.

The growth in non-package revenue resulted primarily from the
continued growth of the UPS Logistics Group. This growth
reflects both new business and increased business with existing
customers. Revenue for the non-package segment was also
increased by the new arrangement for providing excess value
package insurance for our customers, which commenced in the
fourth quarter of 1999.

Operating expenses increased by $1.366 billion, or 6.3%, which
was less than our increase in revenue of 9.1%. Compensation and
benefit expenses accounted for $939 million of this increase.
Purchased transportation costs increased by $160 million and
fuel costs increased by $77 million. The operating margin for
1999 was 14.4% compared to 12.1% in 1998. This improvement was
largely due to containment of operating expense growth through
better utilization of existing capacity and from continued
company-wide cost containment efforts.

The following table shows the change in operating profit, both
in dollars and in percentage terms:

U.S. domestic package operating profit improved due to the
volume and revenue improvements discussed previously, combined
with the containment of operating expense growth.

Our international package operating profit improved
significantly in 1999 due to a shift to higher yielding export
packages. Average daily volume for our export products grew
18.4% over 1998. The Europe and Asia Pacific regions contributed
significantly to overall operating profit improvements.

The increase in non-package operating profit was largely due to
the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance
for our customers. The new arrangement for excess value package
insurance, which was implemented in the fourth quarter of 1999,
increased non-package operating profit by $60 million. This
increase was offset by continued start-up costs at UPS Capital
Corporation, higher third party underwriting losses for UPINSCO,
our captive insurance company, and a reduction in intersegment
profit. The UPS


Logistics Group experienced a small decrease in operating profit
compared to last year. This decrease was due to third-party
transportation costs for the group’s service parts
logistics offering and higher fuel costs for its UPS Truck
Leasing subsidiary. These decreases were offset somewhat by
higher operating profits for the group’s supply chain
management offering.

The increase in investment income of $93 million for the year
was due to large cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities and short-term investments balances we have
maintained during 1999, including the IPO proceeds received in
November.

Net income for 1999 decreased by $858 million from 1998,
resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share from $1.57
in 1998 to $0.77 in 1999. These results reflect the charge we
recorded during the second quarter of 1999, resulting from an
unfavorable ruling of the U.S. Tax Court. Excluding the impact
of this one-time charge of $1.442 billion, our adjusted net
income for 1999 would have been $2.325 billion, with an
associated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.04. Further
discussion of this matter is included in the Liquidity and
Capital Resources section.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from
operations. We maintain significant cash, cash equivalents,
marketable securities and short-term investments, amounting to
$2.0 billion at December 31, 2000. Of this amount,
approximately $105 million represents the net proceeds remaining
from our initial public offering, which was completed in
November 1999. In November 1999, we received net proceeds of
$5.266 billion from our initial public offering. We used the
majority of the IPO proceeds to fund a cash tender offer to
purchase Class A-1 shares from shareowners.

The remaining IPO proceeds of approximately $105 million as of
December 31, 2000 were available for a share repurchase program
that was announced on April 20, 2000. In addition, an
additional $750 million has been authorized for share
repurchases.

We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are
authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion. Approximately $1.366
billion was outstanding under these programs as of
December 31, 2000. Since we do not intend to refinance the
full commercial paper balance outstanding at December 31,
2000, $366 million has been classified as a current liability in
our balance sheet. The average interest rate on the amount
outstanding at December 31, 2000 was 6.5%.

We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks.
These agreements provide revolving credit facilities of $1.25
billion each, with one expiring on April 26, 2001 and the
other expiring on April 27, 2005. Interest on any amounts
we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day
LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under
either of these agreements as of December 31, 2000.

We also maintain a $1.0 billion European medium-term note
program. Under this program, we may issue notes from time to
time, denominated in a variety of currencies. At
December 31, 2000, $1.0 billion was available under this
program. The $200 million outstanding at December 31, 2000,
which was issued under this program in 1997, bears interest at a
stated rate of 6.625%. Subsequent to December 31, 2000, we
issued $736 million of 30-year Pound Sterling bonds under this
program, which bear interest at a stated rate of 5.50%.

We have filed a shelf registration statement under which we may
issue debt securities in the U.S. of up to $2.0 billion. The
debt may be denominated in a variety of currencies. In September
2000, we issued $300 million cash-settled convertible senior
notes due September 27, 2007 pursuant to our shelf
registration statement. The notes were sold at par with a stated
interest rate of 1.75% and are callable after three years. The
notes may be exchanged for an amount of cash that is indexed to
the trading price of Class B common stock. There was
approximately $405 million issued under this shelf registration
statement at December 31, 2000. Subsequent to
December 31, 2000, we have issued debt under our UPS Notes
program. The notes issued under this program have various terms
and maturities, all with fixed interest rates. As of
February 28, 2001, $57 million has been issued under this
program. Also subsequent to December 31, 2000, we issued $89


million in floating rate senior notes due December 2050, which
bear interest at one-month LIBOR less 45 basis points.

On August 9, 1999 the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion
unfavorable to UPS regarding a Notice of Deficiency asserting
that we are liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax
years. The Court held that we are liable for tax on income of
OPL, which had reinsured excess value package insurance
purchased by our customers beginning in 1984. In February 2000,
the U.S. Tax Court entered a decision in accord with its opinion.

In addition, during the first quarter of 1999, the IRS issued
two Notices of Deficiency asserting that we are liable for
additional tax for the 1985 through 1987 tax years, and the 1988
through 1990 tax years. The primary assertions by the IRS relate
to the reinsurance of excess value package insurance, the issue
raised for the 1984 tax year. The IRS has based its assertions
on the same theories included in the 1983-1984 Notice of
Deficiency. The IRS, in an issued report, has taken similar
positions for tax years 1991 through 1994. We expect the IRS to
take similar positions for tax years 1995 through 1999. We
believe that a number of aspects of the Tax Court decision are
incorrect, and we have appealed the decision to the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Eleventh Circuit has
heard oral arguments. We do not know when the court will render
a decision.

We have been named as a defendant in 23 lawsuits that seek to
hold us (and in certain cases, other defendants) liable for the
collection of premiums for excess value package insurance in
connection with package shipments since 1984 (or, in some of the
cases, for shorter time periods). The ultimate resolution of
these matters cannot presently be determined.

In addition, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that
arose in the normal course of business. In our opinion, none of
these cases is expected to have a material effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

In November 2000, OSHA published its final ergonomics standard,
which would have required American industry to take expansive
compliance steps in the workplace when employees report
musculoskeletal complaints such as low back pain. The rule was
subsequently challenged by a broad coalition of trade
associations and businesses in actions consolidated in the
United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. We, our
competitors, and other affected parties filed comments with OSHA
challenging several aspects of the rule, including the medical
support and economic and technical feasibility of the proposed
regulations. OSHA took the position that the cost of compliance
with the proposed regulations would have been only $4.5 billion
per year over a ten-year period for all of American industry. We
maintained that these estimates were unrealistic and estimated
that the cost of compliance would have been significantly
greater, both in initial costs and in incremental annual costs.
We estimated that such expenditures, if required to be incurred,
would have materially and adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

Subsequent to December 31, 2000, the United States Senate
and House of Representatives passed joint resolutions
disapproving the OSHA ergonomics standard, and declaring that
the standard shall have no force or effect. President Bush has
signed into law a repeal of the OSHA ergonomics standard. We
anticipate that the legal proceedings described above will be
dismissed as moot.

Reference is made to Note 4 to the accompanying audited
consolidated financial statements for more information on each
of the matters (Tax Court decision, lawsuits and OSHA) discussed
previously.

We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs
will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources
to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our
business, including anticipated capital expenditures such as
commitments for aircraft purchases through 2009.


Following is a summary of capital expenditures:

We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $2.8 billion
in 2001. These expenditures will provide for replacement of
existing capacity and anticipated future growth and include the
projected cost of capitalized software.

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and certain
commodity prices. All of this market risk arises in the normal
course of business, as UPS does not engage in speculative
trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from
these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange,
interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options,
and swaps.

A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative
instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 13
to the consolidated financial statements.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to increases in the price of refined fuels,
principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are all
used in our normal business operations. We use a combination of
options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection
from rising fuel prices. These derivative instruments generally
cover forecasted fuel consumption for periods up to one year.
The net fair value of such contracts, subject to price risk,
excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2000
and 1999 was an asset (liability) of approximately $(5) and $27
million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of
these derivative contracts, assuming a 10% change in the
underlying commodity price, would be approximately $9 and $12
million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. This
amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent
in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating
costs, and financing transactions in currencies other than the
local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency
risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of
our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash
flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to
the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. We use a combination of
purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge
cash flow currency exposures. As of December 31, 2000 and
1999, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described
above was a liability of approximately $9 million and none,
respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such
financial instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in
quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately
$37 million and none for 2000 and 1999, respectively.

This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the
foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in
the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in
a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange
rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign
currency.


Interest Rate Risk

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,
we have various debt instruments, including debt associated with
capital leases, that are issued at fixed rates of interest. Such
financial instruments are exposed to fluctuations in fair value
resulting from changes in market interest rates. The fair value
of our total long-term debt at December 31, 2000 and 1999
was $3.7 and $2.5 billion, respectively. The potential change in
fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% shift in interest
rates would be approximately $127 and $78 million for 2000 and
1999, respectively.

We use a combination of derivative instruments, including
interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as
part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest
rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of
borrowing. These swaps are entered into concurrently with the
issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the
notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the
swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Interest rate
swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating rate debt.

The net fair value of our interest rate swaps at
December 31, 2000 and 1999 was an asset of approximately $3
and $44 million, respectively. The potential decrease in fair
value resulting from a hypothetical 10% shift in interest rates
would be approximately $30 and $13 million for 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the yield
curve. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar
maturities or periods to repricing, they may not react
correspondingly to changes in market interest rates.

Equity Price Risk

We hold investments in various available-for-sale equity
securities that are subject to price risk. The fair value of
such investments, as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, was an asset
of approximately $382 and $87 million, respectively. In
addition, we utilize options to hedge the price risk for certain
of these equity securities. The potential change in the fair
value of these investments, assuming a 10% change in prices, net
of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately
$31 and $9 million for 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Credit Risk

The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed
contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable
to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such
risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the
counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that
meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur
any losses as a result of counterparty default.

Future Accounting Changes

In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“FAS 133”), as amended by Statements
No. 137 and No. 138, which provides a comprehensive
and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of
derivatives and hedging activities. After adoption on
January 1, 2001, all derivative instruments will be
recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, and changes in
the fair values of such instruments will be recognized currently
in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
We will record a one-time cumulative effect, after-tax charge
totaling $14 million in the income statement, as well as an
unrealized accumulated transition adjustment gain of $23 million
to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the initial adoption
of FAS 133 in the quarter ended March 31, 2001.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareowners

United Parcel Service, Inc.

Atlanta, Georgia

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
United Parcel Service, Inc., and its subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareowners’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
United Parcel Service, Inc., and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of

Summary of
Accounting Policies

Initial Public Offering of Common Stock

In November 1999, we became a publicly traded company by issuing
109.4 million shares of Class B common stock of United
Parcel Service, Inc., a newly formed corporation with a new
capital structure, which became the parent of United Parcel
Service of America, Inc. Class A shares of United Parcel
Service, Inc. are entitled to ten votes each, whereas
Class B shares are entitled to one vote each. The
Class A shares initially issued by United Parcel Service,
Inc. were equally allocated among Class A-1, A-2, and A-3
common stock. The different types of Class A common stock
are identical except for the applicable transfer restriction
periods. The transfer restriction periods applicable to
Class A-1 and Class A-2 shares have lapsed;
approximately 365 million Class A-3 shares are subject to
transfer restrictions until May 3, 2001. The new capital
structure has been given retroactive effect in our financial
statements with no changes to previously reported net income.
All of the net proceeds of the IPO of $5.266 billion have
subsequently been used for a tender offer and other repurchases
of our Class A and Class B shares.

Basis of Financial Statements and Business Activities

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of United Parcel Service, Inc., and all of its
subsidiaries (collectively “UPS” or the
“Company”). All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.

UPS concentrates its operations in the field of transportation
services, primarily domestic and international letter and
package delivery. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of a
letter or package.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

As of December 31, 2000, we had approximately 214,000
employees (60% of total employees) employed under a national
master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local
unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters (“Teamsters”). These agreements run through
July 31, 2002. The majority of our pilots are employed
under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent
Pilots Association (“IPA”), which becomes amendable
January 1, 2004. Our airline mechanics are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement with Teamster Local 2727, which
becomes amendable on July 31, 2001. In addition, the majority of
our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with
the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining
agreements with the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers. These agreements have various expiration
dates between July 31, 2002 and May 31, 2003.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments
(including investments in debt and auction rate securities of
$714 million and $3.933 billion at December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively) that are readily convertible into cash. The
carrying amount approximates fair value because of the
short-term maturity of these instruments.

Marketable Securities

Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and
are carried at fair value, with related unrealized gains and
losses reported as other comprehensive income and as a separate
component of shareowners’ equity. The amortized cost of
debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and

F-7

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and
accretion is included in investment income, along with interest
and dividends. The cost of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method; realized gains and losses
resulting from such sales are included in investment income.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation
(including amortization) is provided by the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as
follows: Vehicles — 9 years; Aircraft — 12
to 20 years; Buildings — 20 to 40 years;
Leasehold Improvements — lives of leases; Plant
Equipment — 5 to 8  1/3 years.

The costs of major airframe and engine overhauls, as well as
other routine maintenance and repairs, are charged to expense as
incurred.

Costs in Excess of Net Assets Acquired

Costs of purchased businesses in excess of net assets acquired
are amortized over either a 10-year or 20-year period using the
straight-line method.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be
recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes”
(“FAS 109”). FAS 109 is an asset and liability
approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in our financial statements or
tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, FAS 109
generally considers all expected future events other than
proposed changes in the tax law or rates.

Capitalized Interest

Interest incurred during the construction period of certain
property, plant, and equipment is capitalized until the
underlying assets are placed in service, at which time
amortization of the capitalized interest begins, straight-line,
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Capitalized interest was $26, $20 and $27 million for 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively.

Stock Option Plans

We have adopted the disclosure provisions of FASB Statement
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”(“FAS 123”). Under FAS 123,
companies have the option to measure compensation costs for
stock option plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed
by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(“APB 25”). Under APB 25, compensation
expense is generally not recognized when both the exercise price
is the same as the market price and the number of shares to be
issued is set on the date the employee stock option is granted.
Since our employee stock options are granted on this basis and
we have chosen to use the intrinsic value method, we do not
recognize compensation expense for grants under our plans. We
do, however, include in Note 6 pro forma disclosures of net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value method of
accounting had been applied.

Capitalized Software

Effective January 1, 1999, we adopted the Accounting
Standards Executive Committee Statement of Position
(“SOP”) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,”
which requires that certain costs to develop or obtain computer
software for internal use be capitalized. Prior to the adoption
of SOP 98-1, we expensed all internal use software costs as
incurred. The effect of adopting the SOP was to increase net
income for 2000 and 1999 by $100 and $89 million, or $0.09 and
$0.08 per share on a basic and diluted basis, respectively.
Capitalized costs for this software are amortized using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from three to five
years.

SAB 101

In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements” (“SAB 101”), which provides guidance
on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue
recognition issues in financial statements. We adopted
SAB 101, as required, in the fourth quarter of 2000 without
a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“FAS 133”), as amended by Statements
No. 137 and No. 138, which provides a comprehensive
and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of
derivatives and hedging activities. After adoption on
January 1, 2001, all derivative instruments will be
recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, and changes in
the fair values of such instruments will be recognized currently
in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
We will record a one-time cumulative effect, after-tax charge
totaling $14 million in the income statement, as well as an
unrealized accumulated transition adjustment gain of $23 million
to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the initial adoption
of FAS 133 in the quarter ended March 31, 2001.

Changes in Presentation

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the current year presentation.

Long-Term Debt
and Commitments

Long-term debt, as of December 31, consists of the
following (in millions):

(i)

On January 22, 1998, we exchanged $276 million of the
	original $700 million debentures for new debentures of equal
	principal amount with a maturity of April 1, 2030. The new
	debentures have the same interest rate as the 8 3/8%
	debentures due 2020 until April 1, 2020, and thereafter the
	interest rate will be 7.62% for the final 10 years. The new
	2030 debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at the option
	of the Company at any time. The redemption price is equal to the
	greater of 100% of the principal amount and accrued interest or
	the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payouts
	of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of
	redemption at a benchmark treasury yield plus five basis points
	plus accrued interest. The remaining $424 million of 2020
	debentures are not subject to redemption prior to maturity.
	Interest is payable semiannually on the first of April and
	October for both debentures, and neither debenture is subject to
	sinking fund requirements.

(ii)

The weighted average interest rate on the commercial paper
	outstanding as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, was 6.5% and
	5.8%, respectively. Of the total commercial paper balance
	outstanding as of December 31, 2000, $1.0 billion has been
	classified as long-term debt in accordance with our intention
	and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis
	under our revolving credit facilities. However, the amount of
	commercial paper outstanding in 2001 is expected to fluctuate.
	We are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion under the two
	commercial paper programs we maintain as of December 31,
	2000.

(iii)

The industrial development bonds bear interest at a daily
	variable rate. The average interest rates for 2000 and 1999 were
	4.0% and 3.1%, respectively.

(iv)

The special facilities revenue bonds bear interest at a daily
	variable rate. The average interest rates for 2000 and 1999 were
	4.1% and 3.3%, respectively.

(v)

The floating rate senior notes bear interest at one-month LIBOR
	less 45 basis points. The average interest rates for 2000 and
	1999 were 6.1% and 5.1%, respectively. These notes are callable
	at various times after 30 years at a stated percentage of
	par value, and putable by the note holders at various times
	after 10 years at a stated percentage of par value.

F-10

UNITED PARCEL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —

(vi)

The cash-settled convertible senior notes bear interest at a
	stated rate of 1.75% and are callable after three years. The
	notes may be exchanged for an amount of cash that is indexed to
	the trading price of our Class B common stock. In
	conjunction with the debt offering, we entered into a swap
	transaction in which UPS pays 30-day LIBOR less 38 basis points,
	and receives the 1.75% cash coupon plus any equity appreciation
	payable in cash on the notes. The average interest rate payable
	on the swap for 2000 was 6.3%.

(vii)

We have capitalized lease obligations for certain aircraft,
	which are included in Property, Plant, and Equipment at
	December 31 as follows (in millions):

The aggregate annual principal payments for the next five years,
excluding capitalized leases, are (in millions):
2001 — $579; 2002 — $12; 2003 —
$12; 2004 — $58; and 2005 — $1.

Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company
for long-term debt with similar terms and maturities, the fair
value of long-term debt, including current maturities, is
approximately $3.7 and $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2000
and 1999.

We lease certain aircraft, facilities, equipment, and vehicles
under operating leases, which expire at various dates through
2039. Total aggregate minimum lease payments under capitalized
leases and under operating leases are as follows (in millions):

As of December 31, 2000, we have outstanding letters of
credit totaling approximately $1.1 billion issued in connection
with routine business requirements.

As of December 31, 2000, we have commitments outstanding
for capital expenditures under purchase orders and contracts of
approximately $6.9 billion, with the following amounts expected
to be spent during the next five years (in millions):
2001 — $1,765; 2002 — $1,295;
2003 — $786; and 2004 — $605; and
2005 — $518.

We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks
that provide revolving credit facilities of $1.25 billion each,
with one expiring April 26, 2001, and the other
April 27, 2005. Interest on any amounts we borrow under
these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis
points. At December 31, 2000, there were no outstanding
borrowings under these facilities.

F-11

UNITED PARCEL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

We also maintain a $1.0 billion European medium-term note
program. Under this program, we may issue notes from time to
time, denominated in a variety of currencies. At
December 31, 2000, $1.0 billion was available under this
program. The $200 million outstanding at December 31, 2000,
which was issued under this program in 1997, bears interest at a
stated rate of 6.625%.

We have filed a shelf registration statement under which we may
issue debt securities in the U.S. of up to $2.0 billion. The
debt may be denominated in a variety of currencies. In September
2000, we issued $300 million cash-settled convertible senior
notes due September 27, 2007 pursuant to our shelf
registration statement. The notes were sold at par with a stated
interest rate of 1.75% and are callable after three years. The
notes may be exchanged for an amount of cash that is indexed to
the trading price of our Class B common stock. There was
approximately $405 million issued under this shelf registration
statement at December 31, 2000.

Note  4.

Legal
Proceedings and Contingencies

On August 9, 1999 the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion
unfavorable to UPS regarding a Notice of Deficiency asserting
that we are liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax
years. The Court held that we are liable for tax on income of
Overseas Partners Ltd.(“OPL”), a Bermuda company,
which had reinsured excess value package insurance purchased by
our customers beginning in 1984. The Court held that for the
1984 tax year we are liable for taxes of $31 million on income
reported by OPL, penalties and penalty interest of $93 million,
and interest for a total after-tax exposure estimated at
approximately $246 million. In February 2000, the U.S. Tax Court
entered a decision in accord with its opinion.

In addition, during the first quarter of 1999, the IRS issued
two Notices of Deficiency asserting that we are liable for
additional tax for the 1985 through 1987 tax years, and the 1988
through 1990 tax years. The primary assertions by the IRS relate
to the reinsurance of excess value package insurance, the issue
raised for the 1984 tax year. The IRS has based its assertions
on the same theories included in the 1983-1984 Notice of
Deficiency.

The IRS, in an issued report, has taken similar positions for
tax years 1991 through 1994. We expect the IRS to take similar
positions for tax years 1995 through 1999. Based on the Tax
Court opinion, we currently

F-12

UNITED PARCEL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

estimate that our total after-tax exposure for the tax years
1984 through 1999 could be as high as $2.353 billion. We believe
that a number of aspects of the Tax Court decision are
incorrect, and we have appealed the decision to the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Eleventh Circuit has
heard oral arguments. We do not know when the Court will render
a decision.

In our second quarter 1999 financial statements, we recorded a
tax assessment charge of $1.786 billion, which included an
amount for related state tax liabilities. The charge included
taxes of $915 million and interest of $871 million. This
assessment resulted in a tax benefit of $344 million related to
the interest component of the assessment. As a result, our net
charge to net income for the tax assessment was $1.442 billion,
increasing our total after-tax reserve at that time with respect
to these matters to $1.672 billion. The tax benefit of
deductible interest is included in income taxes; however, since
none of the income on which this tax assessment is based is our
income, we have not classified the tax charge as income taxes.

We determined the size of our reserve with respect to these
matters in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America based on our estimate
of our most likely liability. In making this determination, we
concluded that it is more likely that we will be required to pay
taxes on income reported by OPL and interest, but that it is not
probable that we will be required to pay any penalties and
penalty interest. If penalties and penalty interest ultimately
are determined to be payable, we would have to record an
additional charge of up to $681 million.

On August 31, 1999, we deposited $1.349 billion, and on
August 8, 2000, we deposited an additional $91 million with
the IRS related to these matters for the 1984 through 1994 tax
years. We included the profit of the excess value package
insurance program, using the IRS’s methodology for
calculating these amounts, for both 1998 and 1999 in filings we
made with the IRS in 1999. In February 2000, we deposited $339
million with the IRS related to these matters for the 1995
through 1997 tax years. These deposits and filings were made in
order to stop the accrual of interest, where applicable, on that
amount of the IRS’s claim, without conceding the IRS’s
positions or giving up our right to appeal the Tax Court’s
decision.

After the Tax Court decision, National Union Fire Insurance
Company, a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc.,
notified OPL that effective September 30, 1999, it would
terminate the five underlying policies that provide
shippers’ risk insurance for UPS customers. The termination
of these policies triggered the immediate termination of the
reinsurance agreement between National Union and OPL.

UPS, on behalf of our customers, and National Union agreed on a
restructuring of this program, which became effective
October 1, 1999. Commencing on October 1, 1999,
National Union issued five new policies that include coverage
for UPS customers. Glenlake Insurance Agency, Inc., a licensed
insurance agency formed in 1998 and a wholly owned subsidiary of
UPS Capital Corporation, now offers excess value package
insurance to be issued under the five new polices.

UPS Re Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of UPS, has entered into
a reinsurance agreement under which it will reinsure
substantially all of the risks underwritten by National Union in
exchange for substantially all of the premiums collected. UPS Re
Ltd. is a licensed reinsurance company formed in 1999 to
reinsure risks related to UPS and its subsidiaries. UPS Re Ltd.,
which is domiciled in Bermuda, has elected to be taxed on its
income as part of UPS’s consolidated income tax return for
federal income tax purposes. This revised arrangement should
eliminate the issues considered by the Tax Court in the Notices
of Deficiency relating to OPL for the periods after September
1999.

The IRS has proposed adjustments, unrelated to the OPL matters
discussed above, regarding the allowance of deductions and
certain losses, the characterization of expenses as capital
rather than ordinary, the treatment of certain income, and our
entitlement to the investment tax credit and the research tax
credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years. These proposed
adjustments would result in $15 million in additional income tax
expense. Also, the IRS has issued a report taking a similar
position with respect to some of these issues for each of the
years from 1991 through 1994. This report proposes adjustments
that would result in $155 million

F-13

UNITED PARCEL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

in additional income tax expense. For the 1985 through 1994 tax
years, unpaid interest on these adjustments through 2000 could
aggregate up to $368 million, after the benefit of related tax
deductions. We expect that we will prevail on substantially all
of these issues. Specifically, we believe that our practice of
expensing the items that the IRS alleges should have been
capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry
participants. The IRS may take similar positions with respect to
some of these issues for each of the years from 1995 through
2000. The IRS’s proposed adjustments include penalties and
penalty interest. We believe that the possibility that such
penalties and penalty interest will be sustained is remote. We
believe the eventual resolution of these issues will not result
in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
of operations, or liquidity.

We have been named as a defendant in 23 lawsuits that seek to
hold us (and, in certain cases, other defendants) liable for the
collection of premiums for excess value package insurance in
connection with package shipments since 1984 (or, in some of the
cases, for shorter time periods). These cases generally claim
that we acted as an insurer in violation of our shipping
contract and without complying with state insurance laws and
regulations, and that the price for excess value package
insurance was excessive. Eighteen of these cases have been
consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district
litigation proceeding (“MDL Proceeding”) before the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. An amended consolidated complaint in the MDL Proceeding
also alleges a violation of the federal RICO statute. Another
complaint in the MDL Proceeding alleges violations of federal
antitrust laws. We are in the process of seeking to have four of
the remaining cases consolidated into the MDL Proceeding. The
other remaining case was remanded from federal court to state
court in Madison County, Illinois and is proceeding independent
of the MDL Proceeding. No class has been certified in any of
these cases. These actions all developed after the
August 9, 1999 Tax Court opinion was rendered. We believe
the allegations in these cases have no merit and intend to
continue to defend them vigorously. The ultimate resolution of
these matters cannot presently be determined.

In November 2000, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (“OSHA”) published its final ergonomics
standard, which would have required American industry to take
expansive compliance steps in the workplace when an employee
reported a musculoskeletal complaint such as low back pain. If
OSHA had enforced these regulations by seeking the same
ergonomic measures it has advocated in the past under its
general authority to remedy “recognized hazards,” it
might have demanded extensive changes in the physical layout of
our distribution centers as well as the hiring of significant
numbers of additional full-time and part-time employees. Our
competitors, as well as the remainder of American industry, also
would have incurred proportionately comparable costs.

The rule was challenged by a broad coalition of trade
associations and businesses in actions consolidated in the
United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Among
other arguments against the rule, opponents asserted that OSHA
did not comply with the statutory mandate of establishing
significant risk of material health impairment or properly
analyze the costs and benefits of the proposed regulations. We
believed that either implementation of the rule would be stayed,
that a reviewing court would reject the rule, or that, if
ergonomic regulations resembling this proposal had been
sustained by a reviewing court, we would have prevailed in an
enforcement proceeding based on substantial defenses.

OSHA took the position that the cost of compliance with the
proposed regulations would have been only $4.5 billion per year
over a ten-year period for all of American industry. We
maintained that these estimates were unrealistic and estimated
that the cost of compliance could have been significantly
greater, both in initial costs and in incremental annual costs.
We also estimated that such expenditures, if required to be
incurred, would have materially and adversely affected our
financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

Subsequent to December 31, 2000, the United States Senate
and the House of Representatives passed joint resolutions
disapproving the OSHA ergonomics standard and declaring that the
standard shall have no

F-14

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

force or effect. President Bush has signed into law a repeal of
the OSHA ergonomics standard. We anticipate that the legal
proceedings described above will be dismissed as moot.

In addition, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that
arose in the normal course of business. In our opinion, none of
these cases is expected to have a material effect on our
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Note  5.

Employee
Benefit Plans

We maintain several defined benefit pension plans (the
“Plans”). The Plans are noncontributory and include
all employees who meet certain minimum age and years of service
requirements, except those employees covered by certain
multi-employer plans provided for under collective bargaining
agreements.

The Plans provide for retirement benefits based on either
service credits or average compensation levels earned by
employees prior to retirement. The Plans’ assets consist
primarily of publicly traded stocks and bonds and include
approximately 24.5 and 26.9 million shares of UPS common stock
at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Our funding
policy is consistent with relevant federal tax regulations.
Accordingly, we contribute amounts deductible for federal income
tax purposes.

We also sponsor postretirement medical plans that provide health
care benefits to our retirees who meet certain eligibility
requirements and who are not otherwise covered by multi-employer
plans. Generally, this includes employees with at least
10 years of service who have reached age 55 and employees
who are eligible for postretirement medical benefits from a
Company-sponsored plan pursuant to collective bargaining. We
have the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans. In
many cases, these benefits have been provided to retirees on a
noncontributory basis; however, in certain cases, retirees are
required to contribute towards the cost of the coverage.

The significant assumptions used in the measurement of our
benefit obligations are as follows:

Future postretirement medical benefit costs were forecasted
assuming an initial annual increase of 7.50% for pre-65 and
post-65 medical costs, decreasing to 5.50% for pre-65 and
post-65 by the year 2004 and with consistent annual increases at
those ultimate levels thereafter.

Assumed health care cost trends have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percent change
in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following
effects (in millions):

We also contribute to several multi-employer pension plans for
which the above disclosure information is not determinable.
Amounts charged to operations for pension contributions to these
multi-employer plans were $897, $809 and $757 million during
2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

We also contribute to several multi-employer health and welfare
plans that cover both active and retired employees for which the
above disclosure information is not determinable. Amounts
charged to operations for contributions to multi-employer health
and welfare plans were $501, $463, and $458 million during 2000,
1999, and 1998, respectively.

We also sponsor a defined contribution plan for all employees
not covered under collective bargaining agreements. The Company
matches, in shares of UPS common stock, a portion of the
participating employees’ contributions. Matching
contributions charged to expense were $61, $55 and $49 million
for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Note  6.

Incentive
Compensation Plans

We adopted the UPS Incentive Compensation Plan in October 1999.
The Incentive Compensation Plan permits the grant of
nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares,
performance units, and management incentive awards to eligible
employees. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the
Plan is 112 million, with the number of shares reserved for
issuance as restricted stock limited to 34 million. As of
December 31, 2000, only management incentive awards and
stock option grants had been made under the Incentive
Compensation Plan.

are determined annually by the Compensation Committee of the UPS
Board of Directors. This Committee, in its sole discretion,
determines the total award, which consists of UPS Class A-1
common stock, given in any year. The total of all such awards
historically has been 15% of consolidated income before income
taxes for the 12-month period ending each September 30,
exclusive of gains and losses from the sale of real estate and
stock of subsidiaries and the effect of certain other
nonrecurring transactions or accounting changes. Amounts charged
to operations for Management Incentive Awards were $735, $588,
and $448 million during 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

Nonqualified and Incentive Stock Options

We maintain fixed stock option plans under which options are
granted to purchase shares of UPS Class A common stock.
Prior to adoption of the Incentive Compensation Plan, these
options were granted at the current price of UPS shares as
determined by the Board of Directors on the date of option
grant. Stock options granted in connection with the Incentive
Compensation Plan must have an exercise price at least equal to
the NYSE closing price of UPS Class B common stock on the date
the option was granted. We apply the measurement provisions of
APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for these
plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recorded
for the grant of stock options during 2000, 1999 or 1998. Pro
forma information regarding net income and earnings per share
has been determined as if we accounted for our employee stock
options under the fair value method of FAS 123. For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of
the options granted in 2000, 1999, and 1998 is amortized to
expense over the vesting period of the options.

The pro forma information is as follows (in millions except per
share amounts):

The assumptions used, by year, and the calculated weighted
average fair value of options granted, are as follows:

(1)

Pro forma information for options granted in 2000 and November
	1999 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
	model, as these options were granted in connection with, or
	subsequent to, the IPO. Pro forma information for all options
	granted prior to the IPO was calculated using the minimum value
	method for nonpublic entities.

Persons earning the right to receive stock options are
determined each year by the Compensation Committee of the UPS
Board of Directors. Except in the case of death, disability or
retirement, options granted prior to the adoption of our
Incentive Compensation Plan are exercisable only during a
limited period after the expiration of five years from the date
of grant, while options granted under the Incentive Compensation
Plan are generally exercisable after three years from the date
of grant and before the expiration of the option ten years after
the date of grant. All options granted are subject to earlier
cancellation or exercise under certain conditions.

The following is an analysis of options for shares of
Class A-1 common stock issued and outstanding:

Options were granted to eligible employees under the 1996 Stock
Option Plan in March 1999 and under the Incentive Compensation
Plan in November 1999. Options will no longer be granted under
the 1996 Stock Option Plan, and a limited option grant to
certain employees under the Incentive Compensation Plan occurred
in 2000. Beginning in 2001, options to eligible employees will
generally be granted only in the first quarter of each year at
the discretion of the Board of Directors.

No options were exercisable at December 31, 2000, 1999 or
1998. The following table summarizes information about stock
options outstanding at December 31, 2000:

The valuation allowance increased by $21 and decreased by $25

UPS has foreign loss carryforwards of approximately $714 million
as of December 31, 2000. Of this amount, $301 million
expires in varying amounts through 2010. The remaining $413
million may be carried forward indefinitely. These foreign loss
carryforwards have been fully reserved in the deferred tax
assets valuation allowance due to the uncertainty resulting from
a lack of previous foreign taxable income within certain foreign
tax jurisdictions. In addition, a portion of these losses has
been deducted on the U.S. tax return, which could affect the
amount of any future benefit.

Segment and
Geographic Information

We report our operations in three segments: U.S. domestic
package operations, international package operations and
non-package operations. Package operations represent our core
business and are broken down into regional operations around the
world. Regional operations managers are responsible for both
domestic and export operations within their geographic area.
International package operations include shipments wholly
outside the U.S. as well as shipments with either origin or
distribution outside the U.S. Non-package operations, which
include the UPS Logistics Group, are distinct from package
operations and are thus managed and reported separately. Based
on the requirements of FAS 131, reportable segments include U.S.
domestic package operations, international package operations
and non-package operations.

In evaluating financial performance, we focus on operating
profit as a segment’s measure of profit or loss. Operating
profit is before investment income, interest expense, and income
taxes. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are
the same as those described in the summary of accounting
policies (Note 1), with certain expenses allocated between the
segments using activity-based costing methods.

Segment information as of, and for the years ended
December 31 is as follows (in millions):

Non-package operating profit included $101, $108 and $112
million for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, of intersegment
profit, with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which
reduces operating profit, included in the U.S. domestic package
segment.

Marketable
Securities and Short-Term Investments

The following is a summary of marketable securities and
short-term investments at December 31, 2000 and 1999 (in
millions):

The gross realized gains on sales of marketable securities
totaled $69 million in 2000 and $6 million in 1999. The gross
realized losses totaled $35 million in 2000 and $12 million in
1999. The adjustment to unrealized holding losses on marketable
securities, net of tax, included in other comprehensive income
totaled $1 million in 2000 and $3 million in 1999.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable
securities and short-term investments at December 31, 2000,
by contractual maturity, are shown below (in millions). Expected
maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the
issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay
obligations without prepayment penalties.

Business
Combinations

During the two years ended December 31, 2000, we completed
15 acquisitions that were accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. Pro forma results of operations have not
been presented for any of the acquisitions because the effects
of these transactions were not material to us on either an
individual or

aggregate basis. The results of operations of each acquired
company are included in our consolidated statement of income
from the date of acquisition. During 1999 and 2000, cash and the
assumption of liabilities were the only forms of consideration
for these acquisitions.

We regularly explore opportunities to acquire companies that
would enhance our core package delivery business, as well as our
various non-package businesses. Our acquisitions in 1999 and
2000 included both domestic and international transactions.
During 2000, we completed a total of 13 transactions with an
aggregate purchase value of $433 million, including liabilities
assumed. During 1999, we completed two transactions with an
aggregate purchase value of $119 million, including liabilities
assumed.

Subsequent to December 31, 2000, we announced three
additional transactions that are expected to close during 2001.
First, we entered into an agreement to acquire Fritz Companies,
Inc. in a transaction valued at approximately $450 million
(excluding assumed liabilities). Fritz is a freight forwarding,
customs brokerage and logistics concern, with $619 million of
net revenue for its most recent fiscal year. The acquisition,
which will be accounted for as a purchase, will involve the
exchange of approximately 7.4 million shares of Class B common
stock for all of the outstanding shares of Fritz.

In addition, we entered into an agreement to acquire First
International Bancorp, Inc. in a transaction valued at
approximately $78 million (excluding assumed liabilities). First
International, with a managed loan portfolio of approximately
$1.2 billion, offers a variety of structured trade finance,
commercial and government-backed lending products. First
International will be integrated with UPS Capital Corporation,
the finance subsidiary of UPS, upon the closing of the
transaction. The acquisition, which will be accounted for as a
purchase, will involve the exchange of approximately 1.3 million
shares of Class B common stock for all of the outstanding shares
of First International.

Finally, we entered into an agreement to acquire substantially
all of the assets of Mail Boxes Etc. in a cash transaction
valued at approximately $191 million. MBE is the world’s
largest franchisor of independently owned and operated business,
communication, and shipping centers worldwide. The acquisition
will be accounted for as a purchase.

Note  13.

Derivative
Instruments and Risk Management

We are exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign
exchange, commodity prices, equity prices, and interest rates.
These exposures are actively monitored by management. To manage
the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into a
variety of derivative financial instruments. Our objective is to
reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in
earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign
currency rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and interest
rates. It is our policy and practice to use derivative financial
instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures. As
we use price-sensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of
our existing and anticipated transactions, we expect that any
loss in value for those instruments generally would be offset by
increases in the value of those hedged transactions. We do not
hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.

Commodity Price Risk Management

We are exposed to increases in the price of refined fuels,
primarily jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline. We use a
combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide
some protection from rising fuel prices. These derivative
instruments generally cover forecasted fuel consumption for
periods up to one year. The net fair value of such contracts
subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999 was an asset (liability) of
approximately $(5) and $27 million, respectively. We account for
these contracts as cash flow hedges, and therefore the resulting
gains and losses from these hedges are recognized as a component
of fuel expense when the underlying fuel being hedged is
consumed.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Management

We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating
costs, and financing transactions in currencies other than the
local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency
risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of
our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash
flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to
the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. We use a combination of
purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge
cash flow currency exposures. As of December 31, 2000 and
1999, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described
above was a liability of approximately $9 million and none,
respectively. We have designated and account for these contracts
as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue and,
therefore, the resulting gains and losses from these hedges are
recognized as a component of international revenue when the
underlying sales occur.

Interest Rate Risk Management

Our indebtedness under our various financing arrangements
creates interest rate risk. We use a combination of derivative
instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross-currency
interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed
and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and
related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are entered into
concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are
intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment,
and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the
associated debt. Interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a
target range of floating rate debt. We have designated and
account for these contracts as hedges of the fair value of the
associated debt instruments. Any periodic settlement payments
are accrued monthly, as either a charge or credit to interest
expense, and are not material to net income. The net fair value
of our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2000 and 1999
was an asset of approximately $3 and $44 million, respectively.

Equity Price Risk Management

We hold investments in various available-for-sale equity
securities that are subject to price risk. We use combinations
of options to hedge the price risk exposure inherent in these
securities. The fair value of such options contracts designated
as hedges, as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, was an asset
of approximately $148 million and none, respectively.

Credit Risk

The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed
contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable
to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such
risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the
counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that
meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur
any losses as a result of counterparty default.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

At December 31, 2000 and 1999, our financial instruments
included cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and
short-term instruments, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
short-term and long-term borrowings, and commodity, interest
rate, foreign currency, and equity options, forwards, and swaps.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, and accounts payable approximate carrying values
because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair
value of our debt instruments is disclosed in Note 2, and
the fair value of our marketable securities and short-term
investments is disclosed in Note 11.
