PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

We are the world’s largest express carrier,
the world’s largest package delivery company and a leading
global provider of specialized transportation and logistics
services. We were founded in 1907 as a private messenger and
delivery service in the Seattle, Washington area. Over the past
95 years, we have expanded from a small regional parcel
delivery service into a global company. We deliver packages each
business day for 1.8 million shipping customers to six
million consignees. In 2001, we delivered an average of more
than 13.5 million pieces per day worldwide. Total revenue
in 2001 was over $30.6 billion. We focus on the movement of
goods, information and funds, and we seek to position ourselves
as the world’s premier enabler of global commerce.

Our primary business is the time-definite
delivery of packages and documents throughout the United States
and in over 200 other countries and territories. We have
established a vast global transportation infrastructure and
developed a comprehensive portfolio of guaranteed delivery
services, and we support these services with advanced
technology. We provide logistics services, including integrated
supply chain management, for major companies worldwide. We are
the industry leader in the delivery of goods purchased over the
Internet.

Competitive Strengths

We have the following competitive strengths:

Global Reach and
Scale.

We believe that our integrated
global ground and air network is the most extensive in the
industry. We operate a ground fleet of more than 150,000
vehicles, ranging from custom-built delivery vehicles to large
tractors and trailers, and almost 600 airplanes. In the U.S., we
estimate that our integrated door-to-door delivery system
carries goods having a value in excess of 6% of the U.S. gross
domestic product, and we reach all U.S. businesses and
residential addresses. We have invested billions of dollars in
information technology, a fleet of airplanes and sorting
facilities across our vast global delivery network. Based on the
number of jet aircraft operated, we are the ninth largest
airline in North America. Our primary air hub is located in
Louisville, Kentucky.

We established our first international operation
in Canada in 1975, and we created a domestic operation in West
Germany in 1976. In the 1980s and early 1990s, we expanded our
operations throughout Europe as the single market created by the
European Union drove the need for pan-European delivery
services. Today, we have what we believe is the most
comprehensive integrated delivery and information services
portfolio of any carrier in Europe, and we offer a broad
portfolio of time-definite services, ranging from same-day
delivery to logistics solutions for total supply chain
management.

In the last decade, we created more than two
dozen alliances with Asian delivery companies to supplement
company-owned operations, and we currently serve more than 40
Asia Pacific countries and territories. Direct service between
the U.S. and China began in April 2001. In April 2002, we plan
to open a new intra-Asia hub at Clark Air Force Base in the
Philippines to enable future growth in the region.

We also have operations in Latin America and the
Caribbean, and we are positioned to capitalize upon the growth
potential in those regions. We are the largest air cargo carrier
in Latin America, and we are a leading provider of service parts
logistics in Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition, we
have formed alliances with a number of service partners in
countries throughout our Americas region.

Technology Systems.

We have expanded our reputation as a leading package
distribution company by developing an equally strong capability
as a mover of electronic information. In 2001, we transmitted
about 1.25 billion packets of data via wireless networks,
and we currently collect electronic data on about
12.2 million packages each day — more than any of
our competitors. As a result, we have improved our efficiency
and price competitiveness, and we provide improved customer
solutions.


We have made significant investments in
technology over the past decade. In 2001,

InfoWorld

magazine named UPS among the top 10 of its “InfoWorld
100” ranking for “leveraging the latest technology to
bolster business efforts, maximize return on investment,
streamline business processes, reduce costs, save resources,
improve customer service, and create new streams of
revenue.”

Computerworld ROI

magazine designated UPS
as one of the top wireless innovators in 2001 for
“successfully employing emerging and rapidly evolving
wireless technologies to accomplish strategic business goals in
new and innovative ways.” The state-of-the-art technology
that we deploy over our network enables us to serve our
customers globally in the most efficient ways. This technology
provides our customers with total order visibility and improves
customer service, receiving, order management and accounting
operations. Currently, we process about 87% of our domestic
volume using a UPS shipping system or a UPS-compatible shipping
system.

The following are examples of our technology:

E-Commerce
Capabilities.

We are a leading
participant in and facilitator of global e-commerce, which we
define as the use of networked computer technology to facilitate
the buying and selling of goods and services. According to
Forrester Research, by 2004, business-to-business electronic
commerce will grow to $6.3 trillion, and online
transactions will account for 17% of business trade volume in
the U.S. and 18% of world exports. The U.S. Department of
Commerce also shows that online retail sales increased over 19%
in 2001. We are enabling our customers around the world to
thrive in this environment by providing a portfolio of
technology solutions that integrate critical transportation
information into their business processes.

We have teamed with companies such as SAP, Oracle
and eBay to offer fully integrated web-enabled solutions for our
customers. These solutions give our customers, and our
partners’ customers, direct access to UPS services and
information from within their websites and business
applications. This integration allows customers to improve their
supply chain efficiency, provide better decision-making
information and improve customer service. At the same time, we
gain a competitive advantage as the high-value transportation
solution.

We have also expanded access to UPS around the
globe through our website, www.ups.com®, our wireless
solutions and our innovative set of UPS OnLine® Tools. Our
website strategy is to provide our customers with the
convenience of all the functions that they otherwise would
perform over the phone or at one of our shipping outlets.
UPS.com receives over 60 million hits and processes over
5.7 million package tracking transactions daily. Some of
those tracking requests are now coming from customers in the 34
countries that have wireless access to UPS tracking information.
Businesses in 37 countries can also download our interfaces to
UPS transportation functionality, known as UPS OnLine Tools, to
their own websites for direct use by their customers. This
allows users to access the information they need without leaving
our customers’ websites. Two new OnLine Tools introduced in
2001 include UPS Shipping and UPS Signature
Tracking

.

Broad, Flexible Range of Distribution
Services.

Our portfolio of services
enables customers to choose the delivery option that is most
appropriate for their requirements. All of our air,
international and business-to-business ground delivery service
offerings are guaranteed.

Our express air services are integrated with our
vast ground delivery system. This integrated air and ground
network enhances pickup and delivery density and provides us
with the flexibility to transport packages using the most
efficient and cost-effective transportation mode or combination
of modes. Our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to
optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization.


We make guaranteed international shipments to
more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, including
guaranteed overnight delivery of documents to the world’s
major business centers. We offer a complete portfolio of
time-definite services for customers in major markets. To make
our services more easily available and to integrate our presence
on the web wherever e-commerce is taking place, we have
developed a wide range of Internet tools accessible both from
our website and from the websites of many of our customers.

Customer
Relationships.

We serve the ongoing
package distribution requirements of our customers worldwide and
provide additional services that both enhance customer
relationships and complement our position as the world’s
premier enabler of global commerce.

We focus on building and maintaining long-term
customer relationships. We deliver packages each business day
for 1.8 million shipping customers to six million
consignees. In addition, thousands of other customers access us
daily through On Call Air Pickup® for air delivery
services, about 47,000 letter drop-boxes, and over 11,000
independently owned authorized shipping outlets.

We place significant importance on the quality of
our customer relationships and conduct comprehensive market
research to monitor customer perceptions. Since 1993, we have
conducted telephone interviews with shipping decision-makers
virtually every business day to determine their satisfaction
with delivery providers and perception of performance on 17 key
categories of service factors. We use the telephone interview
data to develop a statistical model that identifies those
service factors that have the greatest impact on improving
customer satisfaction. This proprietary Customer Satisfaction
Index allows us to continuously monitor satisfaction levels, to
focus our sales and communications efforts and new service
developments and to develop process improvement initiatives.

Brand Equity.

We
have built strong brand equity as a leader in quality service
and product innovation in our industry. Among the factors that
contribute to our brand equity are our:

Our brand has successfully made the transition
from a U.S.-based ground delivery company to a global
time-definite service provider with the ability to launch
innovative new products and services around the globe. For
example, we were the first company to offer next-day delivery to
every address in the 48 contiguous states and guaranteed
next-business day delivery of packages and documents by 8:00
a.m. or 8:30 a.m. We also were the first full-service carrier to
introduce same-day delivery services in the U.S., and the first
to provide guaranteed nationwide ground service in the U.S.

Increasingly, our customers recognize that we are
an innovator of transportation and information-based business
solutions on a broadening global scale. For example, in 2000 we
launched UPS Signature Tracking, which allows customers to
electronically view the actual signature image of the person who
signed for a shipment at a delivery as captured on the delivery
driver’s handheld computer. The information includes the
full delivery address and, if applicable, the C.O.D. amount. We
introduced this service in a secure environment on

www.ups.com

in 13 European countries, the U.S., Canada
and Puerto Rico. In 2001, we expanded this service to include a
total of 15 European countries, 18 Asia-Pacific countries
and four Latin American countries. UPS Signature Tracking has
reduced significantly the number of phone calls to our


customer service centers for these information
requests, with a 13.2% reduction achieved on our busiest day in
December 2001 compared to December 2000.

Distinctive People and
Culture.

Our people are our most
valuable asset. We believe that the dedication of our employees
results in large part from our distinctive
“employee-owner” concept. Our employee stock ownership
tradition dates from 1927, when our founders, who believed that
employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful
business, first offered stock to employees. To facilitate stock
ownership by employees, we maintain several stock-based
compensation programs. Currently, employees, retirees,
founders’ families and foundations own about 66% of our
total outstanding shares and control about 95% of the voting
power of our outstanding stock.

Our long-standing policy of “promotion from
within” complements our tradition of employee ownership,
and this policy has reduced significantly our need to hire
managers and executive officers from outside UPS. A majority of
the members of our management team began their careers as
full-time or part-time hourly UPS employees, and have since
spent their entire careers with us. Our chief executive officer
and most of our executive officers have more than 25 years
of service with us and have accumulated a meaningful ownership
stake in our company. Therefore, our executive officers have a
strong incentive to effectively manage UPS, which benefits all
of our shareowners.

Our many community service activities include:

Financial Strength.

Our balance sheet gives us financial
strength that few companies can match. As of December 31,
2001, we had a balance of cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities and short-term investments of approximately
$1.6 billion and shareowners’ equity of
$10.2 billion. Long-term debt was $4.6 billion. Our
financial strength has given us the resources to achieve global
scale and to make needed investments in technology,
transportation equipment and buildings to facilitate our growth.

Growth
Strategy

Our growth strategy is designed to take advantage
of our competitive strengths while maintaining our focus on
meeting or exceeding our customers’ requirements. The
principal components of our growth strategy are as follows:

Build on Our Leadership Position in Our Core
Domestic Business.

Our U.S. package
operation is the foundation of our business and the primary
engine for our future growth. We believe that our tradition of
reliable parcel service, our experienced and dedicated employees
and our unmatched delivery system provide


us with the advantages of reputation, service
quality and economies of scale that differentiate us from our
competitors. Our strategy is to increase core domestic revenues
through cross-selling our existing and new services to our large
and diverse customer base, to limit the rate of expense growth
and to employ technology-driven efficiencies to increase
operating profit. Our core business also is a springboard for
our growth in all other areas, including international,
logistics, supply chain management, e-commerce and financial
services. We plan to focus on maintaining and improving service
quality, meeting customer demands and providing innovative
service offerings in order to continue to grow domestic package
revenues.

Continue International
Expansion.

We have built a strong
international presence through significant investments over a
number of years. In 2001, our international package operations
generated $4.2 billion of revenue. The international
package delivery market has grown, and continues to grow, at a
faster rate than the U.S. market. We plan to leverage our
worldwide infrastructure and broad product portfolio to continue
to improve our international business mix, to grow high margin
premium services and to implement cost, process and technology
improvements.

Europe, which includes our operations in Africa
and the Middle East, remains our largest regional market outside
of the U.S. As the European Community evolves into a single
marketplace, with well-established regional standards and
regulations, we believe that our business will benefit from
additional growth within Europe as well as continued growth in
imports and exports worldwide. We plan to solidify and expand
our market position in Europe, where we already have created a
pan-European network. We believe that we have the strongest
portfolio of pan-European services of any integrated carrier in
Europe, combining time-definite delivery options and related
information capabilities. We plan to continue to expand our
service offerings in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

We continue to invest in infrastructure and
technology in Asia. Direct service between the U.S. and China
began in April 2001. In April 2002, we plan to open a
new intra-Asia hub at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines to
enable future growth in the region. This hub will complement our
existing hubs in Hong Kong and Taiwan and allow us to more
aggressively pursue the Asian express market and improve our
Europe-to-Asia service. We also have acquired landing slots on
the new runway at Tokyo’s Narita Airport, which will
enhance access and connections to the new intra-Asia hub. We
continue to seek additional operating rights in a number of
countries, including Hong Kong, Japan, China and South Korea. We
now have express handling centers at Incheon Airport in Seoul
and Pudong Airport in China, and we recently expanded our
code-sharing arrangement with Nippon Air Cargo.

We also have introduced technology, including UPS
Signature Tracking and the DIAD, in critical Asia markets. We
have expanded our native language capabilities with traditional
and simplified Chinese, Japanese and Korean, and we are
committed to bringing our wireless service to cell phones and
PDAs throughout Asia.

We believe that there is significant untapped
potential for us to expand our service offerings in Latin
America. To this end, we have introduced overnight delivery
between key cities in Mercosur and other trade blocs. In
November 2001, we opened our Americas International Gateway in
Miami, Florida. This new gateway complements our current
operations in Florida and Latin America and represents our
commitment to the Americas market. We are the largest air cargo
carrier in Latin America, and we believe that this position will
enable us to further develop our cargo business and provide
advantages in pursuit of additional express package volume.

Provide Comprehensive Supply Chain and
Financial Solutions.

Many businesses
have decided to outsource the management of all or part of their
supply chains to streamline and gain efficiencies, to strengthen
their balance sheets and to improve service. We anticipate that
there will be further demand for a global service offering that
incorporates transportation, service parts logistics and supply
chain services with complete financial support and information
services. We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize
on this growth for the following reasons:

•

We now redesign and operate supply chains for
	major companies in 120 countries, with about 25 million
	square feet of distribution space and over 500 facilities
	worldwide, and we have acquired leading supply chain management
	and service parts logistics providers throughout the world.


Leverage Our Leading-Edge Technology and
E-Commerce Advantage.

According to
Forrester Research, online retail sales will grow 44.4% during
2002 to $74.4 billion. We believe that e-commerce will
drive smaller and more frequent shipments and provide a strong
complement to our core delivery service offerings.

Our goal is to integrate our technology into the
business processes of our customers, providing information to
assist them in serving their customers and improving their cash
flows. We also will use our technology and our physical
infrastructure to help provide the operational backbone to our
customers striving to create new business models in e-commerce.
These new business models generally will operate in just-in-time
or manufacturer-direct distribution modes, which are heavily
dependent on smaller, more frequent shipments. In the process,
we will gain knowledge of new repeatable business models and
market this expertise elsewhere. A key component of this
strategy is to expand relationships with technology providers in
areas such as enterprise resource planning, e-procurement and
marketplace solutions, and to integrate our technologies into
their solutions and into the websites and systems of their and
our customers.

Our leading-edge technology has enabled our
e-commerce partners to integrate our shipping functionality into
their e-commerce product suites. Our partners’ products are
being installed throughout the Internet, and we expect these
integrated systems to provide us with a competitive advantage.
In addition, the technology we integrate into our partners’
products creates significant value for our customers through
reduced cycle times, lower operating costs, improved customer
service, enhanced collections and the ability to offer strong
delivery commitments.

Our website at

www.ec.ups.com

supports our
commitment to e-commerce, promotes the advantages of e-commerce
and spotlights our unique position with regard to the
facilitation of e-commerce.

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Global
Alliances.

In order to remain the
preeminent global company in our industry, we will continue to
make strategic acquisitions and enter into global alliances. We
are positioned to pursue strategic acquisitions and enter into
global alliances that can:


During 2001, we completed 12 acquisitions, which
were concentrated primarily in the non-package segment and the
customs brokerage industry. These included:

•

Fritz Companies, Inc.

In May 2001, we acquired Fritz
	Companies, Inc., a global freight forwarding, customs brokerage
	and logistics company in a transaction in which we issued
	7.3 million shares of class B common stock valued at
	approximately $456 million.

•

First International Bancorp, Inc.

In August 2001, we acquired First
	International Bancorp, Inc., a provider of structured trade
	finance, commercial and government-backed lending products, in a
	transaction in which we issued 1.1 million shares of
	class B common stock valued at approximately
	$54 million.

•

Mail Boxes Etc.

In
	April 2001, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Mail
	Boxes Etc., the world’s largest franchisor of independently
	owned and operated business, communication and shipping centers,
	for approximately $185 million in cash.

Products and
Services — Package Operations

Domestic Ground Services

primarily in the delivery of packages traveling by ground

contiguous states and intrastate in Alaska and Hawaii. We
restrict this service to packages that weigh no more than 150

it easier for customers to access our expanding range of
logistics, freight, financial and consulting services in order
to improve the performance of their global supply chains.

Our website,

www.ups.com,

brings a wide
array of information services to customers worldwide. Package
tracking, pick-up requests, rate quotes, account opening,
wireless registration, drop-off locator, transit times


and supply ordering services all are available at
the customer’s desktop. The site also displays full
domestic and international service information.

Sales and
Marketing

Our field sales organization includes about 3,600
domestic and 1,200 international account executives worldwide.
Account executives are assigned to individual operating
districts. For our largest multi-site customers, we have an
organization of regionally based account managers who report
directly to our corporate office.

In addition to our general sales force, we have
three supplemental sales forces. In the U.S., we have an
international business sales force, which is focused on
international business out of major U.S. business centers, and a
UPS Hundredweight Service sales force, which targets LTL volume.
Globally, we have an e-commerce sales team, which focuses on UPS
technology solutions for businesses.

Our marketing organization is generally organized
along similar lines. At the corporate level, the marketing group
is engaged in brand management, rate-making and revenue
management policy, market and customer research, product
development, product management, marketing alliances and
e-commerce, including the non-technical aspects of our web
presence. Advertising, public relations and most formal
marketing communications are centrally conceived and controlled.

Individual district and region marketing
personnel are engaged in business planning, bid preparation and
other revenue management activities, and in coordinating
alignment with corporate marketing initiatives. Individual
regions and districts may engage in local promotional and public
relations activities pertinent to their locales.

Employees

During 2001, we had approximately 371,000
employees.

We have received numerous awards and wide
recognition as an employer-of-choice, including the following.

As of December 31, 2001, we employed
approximately 232,500 of our employees (64% of our total
employees) under a national master agreement and various
supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters. These agreements run
through July 31, 2002. We employ the majority of our pilots
under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent
Pilots Association. This agreement becomes amendable on
January 1, 2004. Our airline mechanics are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement with Teamster Local 2727, which
became amendable July 31, 2001. Members of Teamsters 2727
recently voted down a proposed new contract, and negotiations
are scheduled to resume in April 2002. The majority of our
ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the
Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements
with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers. These agreements have various expiration dates between
July 31, 2002 and May 31, 2003.

We believe that our relations with our employees
are good.


Competition

We are the largest package distribution company
in the world, in terms of both revenue and volume. We offer a
broad array of services in the package delivery industry and,
therefore, compete with many different companies and services on
a local, regional, national and international basis. Our
competitors include the postal services of the United States and
other nations, various motor carriers, express companies,
freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our major
competitors include FedEx Corp., the United States Postal
Service, Airborne Express, DHL Worldwide Express, Deutsche Post
and TNT Post Group.

We believe competition increasingly is based on a
carrier’s ability to integrate its distribution and
information systems with its customers’ systems to provide
unique transportation solutions at competitive prices. We rely
on our vast infrastructure and service portfolio to attract and
maintain customers. As we expand our logistics and other
non-package businesses, we compete with a number of participants
in the logistics, financial services and information technology
industries.

Government
Regulation

Both the U.S. Department of Transportation and
the Federal Aviation Administration regulate air transportation
services.

The DOT’s authority primarily relates to
economic aspects of air transportation, such as discriminatory
pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and
cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates, subject to the
authority of the President of the United States, international
routes, fares, rates and practices, and is authorized to
investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of
United States air carriers abroad. We are subject to U.S.
customs laws and related DOT regulations regarding the import
and export of shipments to and from the U.S. In addition, our
customs brokerage entities are subject to those same laws and
regulations as they relate to the filing of documents on behalf
of client importers and exporters.

The FAA’s authority primarily relates to
safety aspects of air transportation, including aircraft
standards and maintenance, personnel and ground facilities. In
1988, the FAA granted us an operating certificate, which remains
in effect so long as we meet the operational requirements of
federal aviation regulations.

The FAA has issued rules mandating repairs on all
Boeing Company and McDonnell-Douglas Corporation aircraft that
have completed a specified number of flights, and also has
issued rules requiring a corrosion control program for Boeing
Company aircraft. Our total expenditures under these programs
for 2001 were about $23 million. The future cost of repairs
pursuant to these programs may fluctuate. All mandated repairs
have been completed, or are scheduled to be completed, within
the timeframes specified by the FAA.

In response to the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks, the FAA issued a federal ground stop order
prohibiting all flights to, from, and within the United States.
Due to this order, all domestic UPS aircraft were grounded, and
international flights into the United States were diverted, on
September 11th and 12th. During this time, we were able to
transport many of our express shipments through our extensive
ground network until the FAA order was lifted and our air
operations resumed on the evening of September 13th. We may
become subject to additional regulation (by the FAA or by other
federal or state agencies) as a result of increased security
concerns in the aftermath of September 11.

On September 22, 2001, President Bush signed
into law the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization
Act, a $15 billion emergency economic assistance package to
mitigate the dramatic financial losses experienced by the
nation’s air carriers. Among other things, the
Stabilization Act provides for:

•

$5 billion in compensation for direct losses
	incurred as a result of the federal ground stop order and for
	incremental losses incurred through December 31 as a result
	of the attacks,

•

$10 billion in federal loan guarantees and
	credits,


•

expanded war risk insurance coverage for air
	carriers, and

•

government assistance for short-term increases in
	insurance premiums.

We submitted a claim for compensation to the
Department of Transportation and recognized a pre-tax amount of
$74 million related to this reimbursement as a credit to other
operating expenses. We cannot be assured of the timing or amount
of any additional payments we may be entitled to receive under
the Stabilization Act.

Our ground transportation of packages in the
United States is subject to the DOT’s jurisdiction with
respect to the regulation of routes and to both the DOT’s
and the states’ jurisdiction with respect to the regulation
of safety, insurance and hazardous materials.

We are subject to similar regulation in many
non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S.
government regulation of aviation rights to and beyond non-U.S.
jurisdictions, and non-U.S. customs regulation.

The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created the
United States Postal Service as an independent establishment of
the executive branch of the federal government, and vested the
power to recommend domestic postal rates in a regulatory body,
the Postal Rate Commission. We believe that the U.S. Postal
Service consistently attempts to set rates for its monopoly
services, particularly first class letter mail, above the cost
of providing these services, in order to use the excess revenues
to subsidize its expedited, parcel, international and other
competitive services. Therefore, we participate in the postal
rate proceedings before the Postal Rate Commission in an attempt
to secure fair postal rates for competitive services.

Properties

Operating Facilities

We own our headquarters, which are located in
Atlanta, Georgia and consist of about 735,000 square feet of
office space on an office campus.

We also own our 27 principal U.S. package
operating facilities, which have floor spaces that range from
about 310,000 to 693,000 square feet. In addition, we have a
1.9 million square foot operating facility near Chicago,
Illinois, which is designed to streamline shipments between East
Coast and West Coast destinations, and we own or lease about
1,500 additional smaller package operating facilities in the
U.S. The smaller of these facilities have vehicles and drivers
stationed for the pickup of packages and facilities for the
sorting, transfer and delivery of packages. The larger of these
facilities have additional facilities for servicing our


vehicles and equipment and employ specialized
mechanical installations for the sorting and handling of
packages.

We also own or lease almost 600 facilities that
support our international package operations and over 800
facilities that support our non-package operations. Our
non-package operations maintain facilities with about 25 million
square feet of floor space. We believe that our facilities are
adequate to support our current operations.

Our aircraft are operated in a hub and spokes
pattern in the United States. Our principal air hub in the
United States is located in Louisville, Kentucky, with regional
air hubs in Columbia, South Carolina; Dallas, Texas; Hartford,
Connecticut; Ontario, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;
and Rockford, Illinois. These hubs house facilities for the
sorting, transfer and delivery of packages. Our Louisville,
Kentucky hub handles the largest volume of packages for air
delivery in the United States. Our European air hub is located
in Cologne, Germany, and our Asia-Pacific air hub is located in
Taipei, Taiwan. Our regional air hub in Canada is located in
Hamilton, Ontario.

Our new automated sorting facility, “Hub
2000,” currently is nearing completion in Louisville,
Kentucky. We expect this new facility to add efficiency and to
increase our hub capacity by over 40% in Louisville. Hub 2000
commenced partial operations in September 2000, and phase II
opened successfully in August 2001. We anticipate that Hub 2000
will be fully operational by Fall 2002.

Our computer operations are consolidated in a
435,000 square foot owned facility, the Ramapo Ridge facility,
which is located on a 39-acre site in Mahwah, New Jersey. We
also own a 175,000 square foot facility located on a 25-acre
site in the Atlanta, Georgia area, which serves as a backup to
the main computer operations facility in New Jersey. This
facility provides production functions and backup capacity in
case a power outage or other disaster incapacitates the main
data center. It also helps us to meet communication needs.

Fleet

Aircraft

The following table shows information about our
aircraft fleet as of December 31, 2001:

We maintain an inventory of spare engines and
parts for each aircraft.


All of the aircraft we own meet Stage III
federal noise regulations and can operate at airports that have
aircraft noise restrictions. We became the first major airline
to successfully operate a 100% Stage III fleet more than
three years in advance of the date required by federal
regulations.

During 2001, we took delivery of
11 Airbus A300-600 aircraft, three Boeing MD-11
aircraft and two Boeing 767-300 aircraft. We have firm
commitments to purchase ten Boeing MD-11 aircraft between
2002 and 2004 and 72 Airbus A300-600 aircraft between
2002 and 2009. We also have options to purchase
22 Boeing MD-11 aircraft between 2005 and 2010 and
50 Airbus A300-600 aircraft between 2004 and 2012.

Vehicles

We operate a ground fleet of more than 150,000
vehicles, ranging from custom built delivery vehicles to large
tractors and trailers.

Our ground support fleet consists of over 24,000
pieces of equipment designed specifically to support our
aircraft fleet, ranging from non-powered container dollies and
racks to powered aircraft main deck loaders and cargo tractors.
We also have over 32,000 containers used to transport cargo in
our aircraft.

Safety

We promote safety throughout our operations.

Our Automotive Fleet Safety Program is built with
the following components:

We have a comprehensive health and safety program
that is monitored by our employee-management health and safety
committees. The workplace safety process focuses on employee
conditioning and safety-related habits. We enlist
employees’ help in designing facilities and work processes.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

On August 9, 1999, the United States Tax
Court held that we were liable for tax on income of Overseas
Partners Ltd. (“OPL”), a Bermuda company that had
reinsured excess value (“EV”) package insurance
purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that we were
liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years. The
Court held that for the 1984 tax year we were liable for taxes
of $31 million on income reported by OPL, penalties and
penalty interest of $93 million, and interest for a total
after-tax exposure estimated at approximately $246 million.


On June 20, 2001, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the Tax Court’s
decision. On September 13, 2001, the Eleventh Circuit
denied the IRS’s petition to have the appeal reheard en
banc. The IRS did not appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court
and, consequently, the case has been remanded to the Tax Court
to consider alternative arguments raised by the parties. At this
time, we do not know what the outcome of the remanded
proceedings in the Tax Court will be.

The IRS has taken similar positions to those
advanced in the Tax Court decision for tax years subsequent to
1984. Tax years 1985 through 1990 currently are docketed in the
Tax Court, although no trial date has been set pending
resolution of the case that covers the 1984 year. Further,
the IRS has issued a report asserting similar positions for the
1991 through 1994 tax years, and we expect the IRS to take
similar positions for tax years 1995 through 1999. Based on the
Tax Court decision, we estimate that our total after-tax
exposure for tax years 1984 through 1999 could be as high as
$2.353 billion.

In our second quarter 1999 financial statements,
we recorded a tax assessment charge of $1.786 billion,
which included an amount for related state tax liabilities. The
charge included taxes of $915 million and interest of
$871 million. This assessment resulted in a tax benefit of
$344 million related to the interest component of the
assessment. As a result, our net charge to net income for the
tax assessment was $1.442 billion, increasing our total
after-tax reserve at that time with respect to these matters to
$1.672 billion. The tax benefit of deductible interest was
included in income taxes in 1999; however, since none of the
income on which this tax assessment is based is our income, we
did not classify the tax charge as income taxes.

We determine the size of our reserve with respect
to these matters in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In 1999, we
estimated our most likely liability based on the initial Tax
Court decision. In making this determination, we concluded that,
based on the Tax Court decision, it was more likely that we
would be required to pay taxes on income reported by OPL and
interest, but that it was not probable that we would be required
to pay any penalties and penalty interest. In our prior
estimation, if penalties and penalty interest ultimately were
determined to be payable, we would have had to record an
additional charge of up to $681 million. Since the outcome
of remanded proceedings in the Tax Court is uncertain, we
currently do not know what impact the Eleventh Circuit decision
ultimately will have on our recorded reserve and above
estimations for this matter.

Further, again as a result of the unfavorable Tax
Court decision, and in order to stop the potential accrual of
additional interest that might ultimately be determined to be
due to the IRS, on August 31, 1999, we paid
$1.349 billion and, on August 8, 2000, we paid an
additional $91 million, to the IRS related to these matters
for the 1984 through 1994 tax years. We included the profit of
the EV insurance program, using the IRS’s methodology for
calculating these amounts, for both 1998 and 1999 in filings we
made with the IRS in 1999. In February 2000, we paid
$339 million to the IRS related to these matters for the
1995 through 1997 tax years. These amounts will remain with the
IRS pending further proceedings.

The EV program that was the subject of the Tax
Court decision has been changed since September 1999. The
revised arrangement should eliminate the issues considered by
the Tax Court and the Eleventh Circuit related to OPL.

The IRS has proposed adjustments, unrelated to
the OPL matters discussed above, regarding the allowance of
deductions and certain losses, the characterization of expenses
as capital rather than ordinary, the treatment of certain
income, and our entitlement to the investment tax credit and the
research tax credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years. The
proposed adjustments would result in $16 million in
additional income tax expense. Also, the IRS has issued a report
taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues
for each of the years from 1991 through 1994. This report
proposes adjustments that would result in $155 million in
additional income tax expense. For the 1985 through 1994 tax
years, unpaid interest on these adjustments through
December 31, 2001 could aggregate up to approximately
$436 million, after the benefit of related tax deductions.
We expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these
issues. Specifically, we believe that our practice of expensing
the items that the IRS alleges should have been capitalized is
consistent with the practices of other industry participants.
The IRS may take similar positions with respect to some of these
issues for each of the years 1995 through 2001. The IRS’s
proposed adjustments include penalties and penalty interest. We
believe that the possibility that such penalties and penalty
interest will be sustained is remote. We


believe that the eventual resolution of these
issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.

We are named as a defendant in twenty-five
pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection
of premiums for EV insurance in connection with package
shipments since 1984. Based on a variety of state and federal
tort, contract and statutory claims, these cases generally claim
that we failed to remit collected EV premiums to an independent
insurer; we failed to provide promised EV insurance; we acted as
an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and
regulations; and the price for EV insurance was excessive.

These actions were filed after the August 9,
1999 Tax Court decision. As discussed above, on June 20,
2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled
in our favor and reversed the Tax Court decision.

Twenty-four of these twenty-five cases have been
consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district
litigation proceeding (“MDL Proceeding”) in federal
court in New York. Motions to dismiss these cases are pending,
as are motions to remand several of these cases to state court.
The other pending case was filed on January 28, 2002 in
state court in Georgia. We have removed it to federal court and
are seeking to have it consolidated into the MDL Proceeding.

In addition to the cases in which UPS is named as
a defendant, there is also an action,

Smith v. Mail Boxes
Etc.,

against Mail Boxes Etc. and its franchisees relating
to UPS EV insurance purchased through Mail Boxes Etc. centers.
Although the case has been pending in California state court,
the complaint was recently amended to allege a nationwide
plaintiff class, and to add a UPS subsidiary, Mail Boxes Etc.,
Inc. (“New MBE”), and an MBE franchisee as a
representative of a purported nationwide defendant class of
franchisees, as new defendants. Previously, only the former
franchisor, which was not affiliated with UPS, was named a
defendant. New MBE has removed the case to federal court, and is
attempting to have it consolidated into the MDL Proceeding. The
plaintiff is seeking to have the case remanded back to state
court.

We believe that the allegations in these cases
have no merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously.
The ultimate resolution of these cases cannot presently be
determined.

There was an additional EV case that was pending
in state court in Madison County, Illinois (

Triad Industries,
Inc. v. UPS

). Shortly before the Eleventh Circuit reversed
the Tax Court decision, we entered into a settlement of this
case — only with respect to Illinois EV
shippers — based in part on our desire to vigorously
defend these actions in the single MDL Proceeding. While
expressly denying any and all liability, the settlement resolved
the Illinois case. This settlement has no impact on the claims
pending in the MDL Proceeding regarding EV purchases relating to
shipments from states other than Illinois. The Illinois court
held a fairness hearing on November 15, 2001, and approved
the settlement. No appeals were filed to challenge the
settlement, and the deadline to do so has passed. Under the
settlement, we will provide qualifying settlement class members
with coupons toward the purchase of specified UPS services,
subject to the terms and conditions of the settlement, and have
paid the agreed-upon plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The
settlement’s ultimate cost to us will depend upon a number
of factors. This settlement did not have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

In addition, we are a defendant in various other
lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe
that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
	of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Operations

Compared to 2000

The following tables set forth information
showing the change in revenue, average daily package volume and
average revenue per piece, both in dollars or amounts and in
percentage terms:


U.S. domestic package revenue was flat compared
to 2000, primarily as a result of a 1.0% decrease in average
daily package volume, offset by a 1.7% increase in average
revenue per piece. The decrease in volume resulted from the
declining U.S. economy during 2001. For the first quarter of
2001, average daily domestic volume was up 1.3%. However,
average daily domestic volume was down 0.9% during the second
quarter, down 3.4% during the third quarter, and down 0.8%
during the fourth quarter. The third quarter decline was largely
a result of the events of September 11th. Also affecting
the period comparison were two extra operating days in 2000
compared to 2001.

During the first quarter of 2001, we increased
rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.1% for
commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge increased
$0.05 to $1.05 over the commercial ground rate, and we increased
rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day
Air, and 3 Day Select an average of 3.7%. The surcharge for UPS
Next Day Air Early A.M. increased from $25.00 to $27.50. Rates
for international shipments originating in the United States
(Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide
Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased by
2.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S.
were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic
market. In addition, all package rates during 2001, up until
December 10th, included a 1.25% fuel surcharge that was put
in place August 7, 2000. Effective December 10, 2001,
we implemented an index-based surcharge which initially reduced
the surcharge rate to 0.75% and which will reset on a monthly
basis beginning in February 2002. The index-based surcharge
could range from 0.00% to 1.50% and is based on the National
U.S. Average On-Highway Diesel Fuel Prices as reported by the
U.S. Department of Energy. Approximately $348 million in
revenue was recorded in 2001 as a result of our fuel surcharge,
an increase of $218 million over the prior year.

The increase in international package revenue was
due primarily to an increase in cargo revenue and a 10.9% volume
growth for our export products, offset by a decline in the
revenue per piece for these products. The increase in cargo
revenue resulted primarily from increased volume which was
driven by the integration of Challenge Air. Our Europe region
was a significant contributor to the export volume increase.
Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, average revenue
per piece for international products increased 1.7%. Overall
average daily package volume increased over 5% for international
operations.

The increase in non-package revenue resulted
primarily from the impact of acquisitions, particularly Fritz,
which is included in our Forwarding and Brokerage Services
component. Non-package revenue also increased due to the
continued growth of the UPS Logistics Group. The Logistics Group
revenue increase was primarily due to increases in our supply
chain management and service parts logistics offerings. Other
non-package revenue also increased as a result of acquisitions
(First International Bancorp and Mail Boxes Etc.), offset by a
decrease in third-party air operations revenue due to the
discontinuation of our charter passenger services.

Operating expenses increased by
$1.425 billion, or 5.6%, with compensation and benefits up
$851 million and other operating expenses up
$574 million. The 5.1% increase in compensation and
benefits included a $101 million reduction in pension
benefits expense, as discussed in Note 5. Depreciation and
amortization and other occupancy expenses (primarily rent and
utilities) accounted for over one-half of the 6.6% increase in
other operating expenses. Much of the increase in operating
expenses was related to expanding our capabilities and service
offerings for our non-package segment. Excluding the non-package
segment, operating expenses increased by 2.6% over 2000. Other
operating expenses include a credit of $74 million for
compensation under the Air Transportation Safety and System
Stabilization Act, as discussed in Note 18. Depreciation and
amortization expense included $72 million of goodwill
amortization, a $33 million increase from 2000.

Our operating margin, defined as operating profit
as a percentage of revenue, declined from 15.2% for 2000 to
12.9% for 2001. This decline continued the trend that began in
the fourth quarter of 2000 as the economy began to weaken. Our
operating margin for the fourth quarter was comparable to the
operating margin for the year.


The following table shows the change in operating
profit, both in dollars and in percentage terms:

U.S. domestic package operating profit decreased
by $309 million due primarily to the decline in volume
discussed previously. This decrease was mitigated by the cost
control initiatives implemented during the year. These
initiatives focused on many of our semi-variable costs and
included curtailing non-union hiring, eliminating new consulting
projects, reevaluating all capital expenditures and information
technology projects in process, plus a variety of other items.
As discussed in Note 18, we recorded a credit to expense related
to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act,
which benefited this segment by $28 million.

The decline in the operating profit of our
international package operations resulted primarily from
increased expenses, particularly those expenses associated with
aircraft used in this segment (maintenance, rental and fuel) as
we continued to add air lift capabilities to further expand our
international presence. This segment was also impacted by the
events of September 11th, and we recorded a
$46 million credit to expense for this segment related to
the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act as
discussed in Note 18. We recorded $11 million of
goodwill amortization in our international package segment in
both 2001 and 2000.

The decrease in non-package operating profit is
partially due to the $49 million gain we recognized from the
sale of our UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary in the first quarter of
2000. The remaining decrease is due to start-up, integration and
operating costs for several subsidiaries that we are developing
or have acquired, along with goodwill amortization expense
associated with recent acquisitions. During 2001, we recorded
$61 million of goodwill amortization in our non-package
segment, which is an increase of $33 million over 2000.
Non-package operating profit includes $113 million
(compared to $101 million in 2000) of intersegment profit,
with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces
operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment.

The decrease in investment income of
$368 million for 2001 is due to two factors relating to
2000. First, in the first quarter of 2000, we recognized a
$241 million gain on investments held by our Strategic
Enterprise Fund in two companies that were acquired by other
companies. In addition, we earned income on the
$5.3 billion in net IPO proceeds available for investment
prior to the tender offer that occurred in early March 2000, and
the $1.2 billion in IPO proceeds that were not utilized for
the tender offer.

Net income for 2001 amounted to
$2.399 billion, or $2.10 per diluted share, compared to
$2.934 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, for 2000. Our
2000 results reflect certain non-recurring items, which include
the gains on our Strategic Enterprise Fund investments and the
sale of our Truck Leasing subsidiary (discussed above), offset
partially by a charge for retroactive costs associated with
creating new full-time jobs from existing part-time Teamster
jobs. Our 2001 results reflect a FAS 133 cumulative expense
adjustment, net of tax, of $26 million. Excluding these
non-recurring transactions for each of these periods, adjusted
net income for 2001 would have been $2.425 billion, a
decrease of $370 million from adjusted net income of
$2.795 billion for 2000. Adjusted diluted earnings per
share decreased from $2.38 in 2000 to $2.12 in 2001.


Compared to 1999

The following tables set forth information
showing the change in revenue, average daily package volume and
average revenue per piece, both in dollars or amounts and in
percentage terms:


U.S. domestic package revenue increased almost
$1.7 billion, or 7.6%, primarily due to volume gains across
all product lines, combined with a 2.7% increase in average
domestic revenue per piece, which was primarily driven by our
Ground products. All products contributed to the revenue
increase, with our higher revenue per piece express (Next Day
Air and Deferred) products increasing at approximately the same
rate (8.1% and 8.0% respectively). Our average daily Ground
volume grew at a 4.2% rate for the period, helping to bring our
total U.S. average daily package volume to almost
12.5 million pieces.

During the first quarter of 2000, we increased
rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.1% for
commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge continued
to be $1.00 over the commercial ground rate, with an additional
delivery area surcharge of $1.50 added to certain less
accessible areas. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next
Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver and UPS 2nd Day Air an average
of 3.5%. The surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. did not
change. Rates for international shipments originating in the
United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS
Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service)
increased by 2.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating
outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied
by geographic market.

The increase in international package revenue was
due to double-digit volume growth for both our domestic and
export products, offset by a decline in the revenue per piece
for these products. This decline was primarily due to a decline
in the value of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar that
occurred during 2000. The value of the Euro averaged $0.92 in
2000 compared to $1.07 in 1999. Overall average daily package
volume increased 13.8% for international operations, with our
export products, which had an average revenue per piece in
excess of $30, increasing at 21.5%.

The increase in non-package revenue resulted
primarily from the new arrangement for providing excess value
package insurance for our customers as well as continued growth
of the UPS Logistics Group. Revenue for the UPS Logistics Group
increased by $250 million, or 32.4%, to over
$1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000. The
new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance
began in the fourth quarter of 1999. Consequently, this item
will have a reduced impact on the comparability of the revenue
for our non-package segment in future periods.

Operating expenses increased by
$2.112 billion, or 9.1%, which was less than our revenue
increase of 10.1%. Compensation and benefits expenses, the
largest component of this increase, accounted for
$1.261 billion of the increase and included a
$59 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2000
relating to the creation of 4,000 new full-time hourly jobs
resulting from the 1997 Teamsters contract. Other operating
expenses increased $851 million primarily due to higher
purchased transportation costs, higher fuel costs and claims
expense associated with the new arrangement for providing excess
value package insurance for our customers. The increase in
purchased transportation costs was primarily due to increased
business for our international and logistics operations. The
40.1% increase in fuel costs from $681 million to
$954 million was due to the increase in fuel prices during
2000 and the additional fuel usage due to the growth in our
average daily package volume, partially offset by cost
reductions generated by our fuel hedging program. The increase
in other operating expenses of $219 million was slightly
offset by the $49 million gain we recognized in the first
quarter of 2000 from the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing
subsidiary. International operating expenses were favorably
impacted by the decline in the value of the Euro relative to the
U.S. dollar as discussed above.

To offset the increasing fuel costs, we
implemented a temporary 1.25% fuel surcharge effective
August 7, 2000. Approximately $130 million in revenue
was recorded in 2000 as a result of the surcharge.

Our operating margin improved from 14.4% during
1999 to 15.2% during 2000. This improvement was favorably
impacted by continued product mix improvements and our continued
successful efforts in obtaining profitable volume growth.


The following table shows the change in operating
profit, both in dollars and in percentage terms:

U.S. domestic package operating profit increased
by $423 million, or 12.1%, due to the volume and revenue
improvements discussed previously.

The improvement in the operating profit of our
international package segment of 20.4%, or $47 million,
resulted primarily from increased volume and revenue, and was
realized despite significantly higher fuel costs. This
improvement occurred throughout our international regions. The
improvement in operating profit for this segment would have been
$36 million greater, if the impact of currency fluctuations
was excluded.

The increase in non-package operating profit is
largely due to the new arrangement for providing excess value
package insurance for our customers, which contributed
$183 million of additional operating profit for the year.
Also contributing to the operating profit improvement was the
$49 million gain we recognized during the first quarter of
2000 from the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary. These
improvements were offset somewhat by start-up costs associated
with UPS Logistics Group’s service parts logistics
offering, UPS e-Ventures, UPS Capital Corporation and other
initiatives. Non-package operating profit includes
$101 million (compared to $108 million in 1999) of
intersegment profit, with a corresponding amount of operating
expense, which reduces operating profit, in the U.S. domestic
package segment.

The increase in investment income of
$330 million for the period is primarily due to two
factors. First, in the first quarter of 2000, two companies in
which our Strategic Enterprise Fund held investments were
acquired by other companies, which caused us to recognize a gain
of $241 million. Second, we earned income on the
$5.3 billion in net IPO proceeds available for investment
prior to the tender offer that was completed in early
March 2000 and the $1.2 billion in IPO proceeds that
were not utilized for the tender offer. In 1999, we had the net
IPO proceeds available for investment from mid-November through
the end of the year. We announced a share repurchase program on
April 20, 2000 under which we would utilize up to the
remaining $1.2 billion not used in the tender offer. As of
December 31, 2000, approximately $105 million remained
available for share repurchases.

Net income for the year ended December 31,
2000 was $2.934 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share,
compared to net income of $883 million, or $0.77 per
diluted share, for the prior year. Our 2000 results reflect the
non-recurring items discussed above, which include the gains on
our Strategic Enterprise Fund investments and the sale of our
UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary, offset partially by the charge for
retroactive costs associated with creating new full-time jobs
from existing part-time Teamster jobs. Our 1999 results reflect
a tax assessment charge resulting from an unfavorable ruling of
the U.S. Tax Court. Excluding these non-recurring transactions
for each of these years, adjusted net income for 2000 would have
been $2.795 billion, an increase in excess of 20% over
adjusted 1999 net income of $2.325 billion. Adjusted
diluted earnings per share would have increased from $2.04 in
1999 to $2.38 in 2000.

Our fourth quarter 2000 results reflected a
decline in our previously reported growth rates for both revenue
and average daily volume. These declines were caused by an
overall weakening of the economy.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow
from operations. We maintain significant cash, cash equivalents,
marketable securities and short-term investments, amounting to
$1.6 billion at December 31, 2001.


As part of our continuing share repurchase
program, $1.3 billion was authorized for share repurchases
in May 2001, and an additional $1.0 billion was
authorized for share repurchases in February 2002.

We maintain two commercial paper programs under
which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion.
Approximately $1.694 billion was outstanding under these
programs as of December 31, 2001, of which
$1.25 billion has been classified as long-term debt in
accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such
obligations on a long-term basis. The average interest rate on
the amount outstanding at December 31, 2001 was 1.85%. In
addition, we maintain an extendible commercial notes program
under which we are authorized to borrow up to $500 million.
No amounts were outstanding under this program at
December 31, 2001.

We maintain two credit agreements with a
consortium of banks that provide revolving credit facilities of
$1.25 billion each, with one expiring on April 25,
2002 and the other expiring on April 27, 2005. Interest on
any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at
90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings
under either of these agreements as of December 31, 2001.

We also maintain a $1.0 billion European
medium-term note program. Under this program, we may issue notes
from time to time, denominated in a variety of currencies. At
December 31, 2001, $1.0 billion was available under
this program. The £500 million Pound Sterling
denominated bonds which are outstanding (recorded at
$725 million at December 31, 2001) were issued in
February 2001 and bear interest at a stated rate of 5.50%.

We have a $2.0 billion shelf registration
statement under which we may issue debt securities in the U.S.
There was approximately $1.132 billion issued under this
shelf registration statement at December 31, 2001,
including $491 million in notes issued under the UPS Notes
program. These notes have various terms and maturities, all with
fixed interest rates. Also during 2001, we issued
$89 million in floating rate senior notes due December
2050, $52 million in floating rate senior notes due
June 2051, and $95 million in floating rate senior
notes due December 2051, all of which bear interest at one-month
LIBOR less 45 basis points.

On August 9, 1999, the United States Tax
Court held that we were liable for tax on income of Overseas
Partners Ltd. (“OPL”), a Bermuda company that had
reinsured excess value (“EV”) package insurance
purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that we were
liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years. The
Court held that for the 1984 tax year we were liable for taxes
of $31 million on income reported by OPL, penalties and
penalty interest of $93 million, and interest for a total
after-tax exposure estimated at approximately $246 million.

On June 20, 2001, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the Tax Court’s
decision. On September 13, 2001, the Eleventh Circuit
denied the IRS’s petition to have the appeal reheard en
banc. The IRS did not appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court
and, consequently, the case has been remanded to the Tax Court
to consider alternative arguments raised by the parties. At this
time, we do not know what the outcome of the remanded
proceedings in the Tax Court will be.

The IRS has taken similar positions to those
advanced in the Tax Court decision for tax years subsequent to
1984. Tax years 1985 through 1990 currently are docketed in the
Tax Court, although no trial date has been set pending
resolution of the case that covers the 1984 year. Further,
the IRS has issued a report asserting similar positions for the
1991 through 1994 tax years, and we expect the IRS to take
similar positions for tax years 1995 through 1999.

We are named as a defendant in twenty-five
pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection
of premiums for EV package insurance in connection with package
shipments since 1984. Based on a variety of state and federal
tort, contract and statutory claims, these cases generally claim
that we failed to remit collected EV premiums to an independent
insurer; we failed to provide promised EV insurance; we acted as
an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and
regulations; and the price for EV insurance was excessive.


These actions were filed after the August 9,
1999 Tax Court decision. As discussed above, on June 20,
2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled
in our favor and reversed the Tax Court decision.

Twenty-four of these twenty-five cases have been
consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district
litigation proceeding (“MDL Proceeding”) in federal
court in New York. Motions to dismiss these cases are pending,
as are motions to remand several of these cases to state court.
The other pending case was filed on January 28, 2002 in
state court in Georgia. We have removed it to federal court and
are seeking to have it consolidated into the MDL Proceeding.

We believe that the allegations in these cases
have no merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously.
The ultimate resolution of these cases cannot presently be
determined.

There was an additional EV case that was pending
in state court in Madison County, Illinois (

Triad Industries,
Inc. v. UPS

). Shortly before the Eleventh Circuit reversed
the Tax Court decision, we entered into a settlement of this
case — only with respect to Illinois EV
shippers — based in part on our desire to vigorously
defend these actions in the single MDL Proceeding. While
expressly denying any and all liability, the settlement resolved
the Illinois case. This settlement has no impact on the claims
pending in the MDL Proceeding regarding EV purchases relating to
shipments from states other than Illinois. The Illinois court
held a fairness hearing on November 15, 2001, and approved
the settlement. No appeals were filed to challenge the
settlement, and the deadline to do so has passed. Under the
settlement, we will provide qualifying settlement class members
with coupons toward the purchase of specified UPS services,
subject to the terms and conditions of the settlement, and have
paid the agreed-upon plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The
settlement’s ultimate cost to us will depend upon a number
of factors. This settlement did not have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

In addition, we are a defendant in various other
lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe
that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

Reference is made to Note 4 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for more
information on the preceding matters.

Due to the events of September 11, 2001 (as
described in Note 18), increased security requirements for
air carriers may be forthcoming; however, we do not anticipate
that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In
addition, our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken
several actions, including self-insuring certain risks, to
mitigate the expense increase.

As of December 31, 2001, we had
approximately 232,500 employees (64% of total employees)
employed under a national master agreement and various
supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the
Teamsters. These agreements run through July 31, 2002. The
majority of our pilots are employed under a collective
bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association,
which becomes amendable January 1, 2004. Our airline
mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with
Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable on
July 31, 2001. Members of Teamsters 2727 recently voted
down a proposed new contract, and negotiations are scheduled to
resume in April 2002. In addition, the majority of our ground
mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the
Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements
with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers. These agreements have various expiration dates between
July 31, 2002 and May 31, 2003.

We entered into negotiations with the Teamsters
in January 2002 for a new national master agreement. It is
our desire through these discussions to reach an agreement on a
new contract prior to the end of our current five-year agreement
on July 31, 2002. Any strike, work stoppage or slowdown
that results from our failure to reach a timely agreement with
the Teamsters, and any change in shipping behavior by our
customers or potential customers due to perceptions that we will
not reach a timely agreement with the Teamsters, could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations. We do not, however, anticipate that this will
occur.


In November 2001, we announced rate
increases, that took effect on January 7, 2002, and are in line
with previous rate increases. We increased rates for standard
ground shipments an average of 3.5% for commercial deliveries.
The ground residential charge increased $0.05 to $1.10 over the
commercial ground rate, and this charge will also be applied to
express deliveries in 2002. The additional delivery area
surcharge added to ground deliveries in certain less accessible
areas remained at $1.50, however in 2002 this charge will also
be applied to express deliveries to these addresses. Rates for
UPS Hundredweight will increase 5.9%. In addition, we increased
rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day
Air, and 3 Day Select an average of 4.0%. The surcharge for
UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. increased from $27.50 to $28.50.
Rates for international shipments originating in the United
States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide
Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased an
average of 3.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside
the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by
geographic market. An index-based surcharge, which initially was
effective December 10, 2001, will continue and will reset
on a monthly basis beginning in February 2002. The
index-based surcharge could range from 0.00% to 1.50% and is
based on the National U.S. Average On-Highway Diesel Fuel Prices
as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy.

We believe that funds from operations and
borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity
and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for
the operation of our business, including anticipated capital
expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases, through
2009. Following is a summary of capital expenditures:

We anticipate capital expenditures of
approximately $2.0 billion in 2002. These expenditures will
provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated
future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized
software.

A discussion of our anticipated future payments
under operating leases, capital leases, debt obligations, and
purchase commitments is provided in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements. A discussion of our unfunded
lending commitments is provided in Note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Market
Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices,
and certain commodity prices. All of these market risks arise in
the normal course of business, as UPS does not engage in
speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk
arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign
exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts,
options, and swaps.

The following analyses provide quantitative
information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange
risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk, and equity price
risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of
the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market
risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange
rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity
prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns,
models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine
the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations
inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion
and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the
analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that
normally would arise from the market shifts modeled.


A discussion of our accounting policies for
derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in
Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Commodity
Price Risk

We are exposed to an increase in the prices of
refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline,
which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally,
we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy
products, primarily natural gas and electricity, used in our
operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination
of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some
protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative
instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy
consumption for periods up to one year. The net fair value of
such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying
exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was a liability
of approximately $(27) and $(5) million, respectively. The
potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts,
assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would
be approximately $27 and $9 million at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting
impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of
the underlying commodities.

Foreign
Currency Exchange Risk

We have foreign currency risks related to our
revenue, operating costs, and financing transactions in
currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate.
We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in
functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated
assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant
foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro and the British
Pound Sterling. We use a combination of purchased and written
options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency
exposures. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the net fair
value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset
(liability) of approximately $4 and $(9) million,
respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such
financial instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in
quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $4
and $37 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively.

This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel
shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates
rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange
rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of
changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in
a foreign currency.

Interest
Rate Risk

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, we have various debt instruments,
including debt associated with capital leases, that are issued
at fixed rates of interest. Such financial instruments are
exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in
market interest rates. The fair value of our total long-term
debt, including current maturities, at December 31, 2001
and 2000 was $5.3 and $3.7 billion, respectively. The
potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical
10% shift in interest rates would be approximately $196 and
$127 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively.

We use a combination of derivative instruments,
including interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate
swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating
interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related
overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are entered into
concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are
intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment,
and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the
associated debt. Interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a
target range of floating rate debt. The net fair value of our
interest rate swaps at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was an
asset (liability) of approximately $(74) and
$3 million, respectively. The potential decrease in fair
value resulting from a hypothetical 10% shift in interest rates
would be approximately $67 and $30 million for 2001 and
2000, respectively.

This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel
shift in the yield curve. Although certain assets and
liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing,
they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest
rates.


Equity
Price Risk

We hold investments in various available-for-sale
equity securities which are subject to price risk. The fair
value of such investments, as of December 31, 2001 and
2000, was an asset of approximately $341 and $382 million,
respectively. In addition, we utilize options to hedge the price
risk for certain of these equity securities. The potential
change in the fair value of these investments, assuming a 10%
change in prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges,
would be approximately $12 and $31 million for 2001 and
2000, respectively.

Credit
Risk

The forward contracts, swaps, and options
previously discussed contain an element of risk that the
counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the
agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these
instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and
financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines.
We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty
default.

Future
Accounting Changes

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement
No. 141 “Business Combinations”
(“FAS 141”) and Statement No. 142
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(“FAS 142”). FAS 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. FAS 141
also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are
required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill.
FAS 142 eliminates the current requirement to amortize
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, addresses the
amortization of intangible assets with a defined life, and
addresses the impairment testing and recognition for goodwill
and intangible assets.

Goodwill amortization, which was $72 million
for 2001, ceased when we implemented FAS 142 on
January 1, 2002. To comply with the transition provisions
of FAS 142, we have determined our reporting units and
assigned goodwill and other net assets to those reporting units.
Goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units is being
tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each
reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value is primarily
being determined through the use of a discounted cash flow
methodology. We have not completed our impairment testing
required by the transition provisions of FAS 142, and
therefore it is not practical, at this time, to estimate the
impact of adoption of this statement.

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement
No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 144”) which
superceded Statement No. 121 “Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of” (“FAS 121”). FAS 144
establishes a single accounting model for long-lived assets to
be disposed of by sale, and resolves several implementation
issues arising from FAS 121. FAS 144 became effective
for us on January 1, 2002, and the effects of adoption were
not material to our results of operations or financial condition.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based on our
consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in our financial
statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are
necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting
principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other
assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances.
Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would
affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements.
While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many
reported amounts, such as pension and postretirement medical
benefits and provisions for self-insured risks, we believe that
the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment
and complexity.

Contingencies

—
As discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial
statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and
contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in
accordance with


Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”
(“FAS 5”). FAS 5 requires a liability to be
recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the
resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these
contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is
settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge
to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled
for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to
income would result.

Goodwill
impairment

— The FASB issued
Statement No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” (“FAS 142”) in June 2001. As a
result of the issuance of this new standard, goodwill will no
longer be amortized, but will be subjected to annual impairment
testing starting in 2002. Goodwill impairment testing will
require that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and
compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our
balance sheet. The estimation of fair value will require that we
make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate
discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could
change over time based on the a variety of factors, including
the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting
units. We have not completed our transitional impairment testing
required by FAS 142, so we are unable to estimate the
impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial
statements. At December 31, 2001, our recorded goodwill
(net of accumulated amortization) was $1.112 billion.

Derivative
instruments

— As discussed
in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, and in
the “Market Risk” section of this report, we hedge
certain risks that are incurred in the normal operation of our
business. In connection with these activities, we have adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” as amended, which requires that all financial
derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such
prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices
are not available, fair value is determined based on other
relevant factors, including dealer price quotations, price
quotations for similar instruments traded in different markets,
and pricing models that consider current market conditions and
contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or
commodities. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign
exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair
value in the future, potentially affecting our results of
operations.

Forward-Looking Statements

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” and other parts of
this report contain “forward-looking” statements about
matters that are inherently difficult to predict. These
statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and
current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects
and future results. We have described some of the important
factors that affect these statements as we discussed each
subject. Forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
statements.

Risk Factors

The following are some of the factors that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected
results described in our forward-looking statements:

•

The effect of general economic and other
	conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the
	United States and internationally. Our operations in
	international markets also are affected by currency exchange and
	inflation risks.

•

Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our
	employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our
	customers’ needs, and customers may do more business with
	our competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely
	affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent
	loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted
	service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements
	also may affect our competitive position and results of
	operations.

•

The impact of complex and stringent aviation,
	transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other
	governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws
	and regulations that may result

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareowners

United Parcel Service, Inc.

Atlanta, Georgia

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of United Parcel Service, Inc. and its
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareowners’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of United Parcel Service, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective January 1, 2001, the
Company changed its method of accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities to conform with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, as amended.

Summary
of Accounting Policies

Initial
Public Offering of Common Stock

In November 1999, we became a publicly
traded company by issuing 109.4 million shares of
Class B common stock of United Parcel Service, Inc. a newly
formed corporation with a new capital structure, which became
the parent of United Parcel Service of America, Inc.
Class A shares of United Parcel Service, Inc. are entitled
to ten votes each, whereas Class B shares are entitled to
one vote each. The Class A shares initially issued by
United Parcel Service, Inc. were equally allocated among
Class A-1, A-2, and A-3 common stock. The different types
of Class A common stock are identical, except for the
applicable transfer restriction periods, which have all now
lapsed. The new capital structure has been given retroactive
effect in our financial statements, with no changes to
previously reported net income. All of the net proceeds of the
IPO of $5.266 billion have subsequently been used for a
tender offer and other repurchases of our Class A and
Class B shares.

Basis of
Financial Statements and Business Activities

The accompanying financial statements include the
accounts of United Parcel Service, Inc., and all of its
consolidated subsidiaries (collectively “UPS” or the
“Company”). All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.

UPS concentrates its operations in the field of
transportation services, primarily domestic and international
letter and package delivery. Through our non-package
subsidiaries, we are also a global provider of specialized
transportation, logistics, and financial services.

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

As of December 31, 2001, we had
approximately 232,500 employees (64% of total employees)
employed under a national master agreement and various
supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”).
These agreements run through July 31, 2002. The majority of
our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement
with the Independent Pilots Association, which becomes amendable
January 1, 2004. Our airline mechanics are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which
became amendable on July 31, 2001. Members of
Teamsters 2727 recently voted down a proposed new contract,
and negotiations are scheduled to resume in April 2002. In
addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not
employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under
collective bargaining agreements with the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These
agreements have various expiration dates between July 31,
2002 and May 31, 2003.

Revenue
Recognition

In our package operations, revenue is recognized
upon delivery of a letter or package. For our non-package
operations, revenue recognition is as follows:

UPS Logistics
	Group

— Material
	management and distribution revenue is recognized upon
	performance of the service provided.

Forwarding & Brokerage
	Services

— Revenue is
	recognized net of the expense related to the transportation of
	freight at the time the services are performed. Customs
	brokerage revenue is recognized upon completing documents
	necessary for customs entry purposes.

F-7

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES — (Continued)

UPS
	Capital

— Income on
	loans and direct finance leases is recognized on the interest
	method. Accrual of interest income is suspended at the earlier
	of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful
	or the account becomes 90 days delinquent. Income on
	operating leases is recognized on the straight-line method over
	the terms of the underlying leases.

In December 1999, the Securities and
Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements” (“SAB 101”), which provides
guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to
revenue recognition issues in financial statements. We adopted
SAB 101 as required in the fourth quarter of 2000 without a
material impact on our financial position or results of
operations.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid investments (including investments in debt and auction
rate securities of $331 and $714 million at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively) that are readily
convertible into cash. The carrying amount approximates fair
value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Marketable
Securities

Marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with related
unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive
income (“OCI”), a separate component of
shareowners’ equity. The amortized cost of debt securities
is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion is
included in investment income, along with interest and
dividends. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method; realized gains and losses resulting from
such sales are included in investment income.

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are carried at
cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided by the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which are as follows: Vehicles — 9 years;
Aircraft — 12 to 20 years; Buildings —
20 to 40 years; Leasehold Improvements — lives of
leases; Plant Equipment — 5 to 8 1/3 years.
The costs of major airframe and engine overhauls, as well as
routine maintenance and repairs, are charged to expense as
incurred.

Goodwill

Costs of purchased businesses in excess of net
assets acquired (goodwill) are amortized over either a 10-year
or 20-year period using the straight-line method. See section on
new accounting pronouncements included in this note.

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets

We review long-lived assets for impairment when
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset is
determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is
recorded.

Income
Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
(“FAS 109”). FAS 109 is an asset and
liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
of events that have been recognized in our financial statements
or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences,

F-8

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES — (Continued)

FAS 109 generally considers all expected
future events other than proposed changes in the tax law or
rates. Valuation allowances are provided if it is more likely
than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Capitalized
Interest

Interest incurred during the construction period
of certain property, plant and equipment is capitalized until
the underlying assets are placed in service, at which time
amortization of the capitalized interest begins, straight-line,
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Capitalized interest was $47, $26 and $20 million for 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

Stock
Options

We have adopted the disclosure provisions of FASB
Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“FAS 123”). Under
FAS 123, companies have the option to measure compensation
costs for stock options using the intrinsic value method
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(“APB 25”). Under APB 25, compensation
expense is generally not recognized when both the exercise price
is the same as the market price and the number of shares to be
issued is set on the date the employee stock option is granted.
Since our employee stock options are granted on this basis and
we have chosen to use the intrinsic value method, we do not
recognize compensation expense for stock option grants. We do,
however, include in Note 6 pro forma disclosures of net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value method of
accounting had been applied.

Capitalized Software

Effective January 1, 1999, we adopted the
Accounting Standards Executive Committee Statement of Position
(“SOP”) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,”
which requires that we capitalize certain costs to develop or
obtain computer software for internal use. Capitalized costs for
this software are amortized using the straight-line method over
periods ranging from three to five years.

Derivative Instruments

Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted FASB
Statement No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“FAS 133”), as amended by Statements
No. 137 and No. 138. FAS 133, as amended,
requires us to record all financial derivative instruments on
our balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives not designated as
hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If a
derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of
the hedge, changes in its fair value that are considered to be
effective, as defined, either offset the change in fair value of
the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through
income, or are recorded in OCI until the hedged item is recorded
in income. Any portion of a change in a derivative’s fair
value that is considered to be ineffective, or is excluded from
the measurement of effectiveness, is recorded immediately in
income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES — (Continued)

At January 1, 2001, our financial statements
were adjusted to record a cumulative effect of adopting
FAS 133, as follows (in millions):

(a)

For income effect, amount shown is net of
	adjustment to hedged items.

The cumulative effect on income resulted
primarily from marking to market the time value of option
contracts used in commodity and foreign currency cash flow
hedging. The cumulative effect on OCI resulted primarily from
marking to market swap contracts used as cash flow hedges of
anticipated foreign currency cash flows and anticipated
purchases of energy products.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement
No. 141 “Business Combinations”
(“FAS 141”) and Statement No. 142
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(“FAS 142”). FAS 141 requires that the purchase
method of accounting be used for all business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001. FAS 141 also specifies
the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be
recognized and reported separately from goodwill. FAS 142
eliminates the current requirement to amortize goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets, addresses the amortization
of intangible assets with a defined life, and addresses the
impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible
assets.

Goodwill amortization, which was $72 million
for 2001, ceased when we implemented FAS 142 on
January 1, 2002. To comply with the transition provisions
of FAS 142, we have determined our reporting units and
assigned goodwill and other net assets to those reporting units.
Goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units is being
tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each
reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value is primarily
being determined through the use of a discounted cash flow
methodology. We have not completed our impairment testing
required by the transition provisions of FAS 142, and
therefore it is not practical, at this time, to estimate the
impact of adoption of this statement.

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement
No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 144”) which
superceded Statement No. 121 “Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of” (“FAS 121”). FAS 144
establishes a single accounting model for long-lived assets to
be disposed of by sale, and resolves several implementation
issues arising from FAS 121. FAS 144 became effective
for us on January 1, 2002, and the effects of adoption were
not material to our results of operations or financial condition.

The UPS Notes program involves the periodic
	issuance of fixed rate notes in $1,000 increments with various
	terms and maturities. At December 31, 2001, the coupon
	rates of the outstanding notes varied between 5.0% and 6.6%, and
	the interest payments are made either monthly or semiannually.
	The maturities of the notes range from 2005 to 2017.
	Substantially all of the fixed obligations associated with the
	notes were swapped to floating rates, based on different LIBOR
	indices plus or minus a spread. The average interest rate
	payable on the swaps for 2001 was 2.8%.

Based on the borrowing rates currently available
to the Company for long-term debt with similar terms and
maturities, the fair value of long-term debt, including current
maturities, is approximately $5.3 and $3.7 billion as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

We lease certain aircraft, facilities, equipment
and vehicles under operating leases, which expire at various
dates through 2051. The following table sets forth the aggregate
minimum lease payments under capitalized and operating leases,
the aggregate annual principal payments due under our long-term
debt, and the aggregate amounts expected to be spent for
purchase commitments (in millions).

Debt principal repayments exclude our outstanding
	commercial paper balance of $1.694 billion.

As of December 31, 2001, we had outstanding
letters of credit totaling approximately $1.3 billion
issued in connection with routine business requirements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND

We maintain two credit agreements with a
consortium of banks that provide revolving credit facilities of
$1.25 billion each, with one expiring April 25, 2002
and the other April 27, 2005. Interest on any amounts we
borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR
plus 15 basis points. At December 31, 2001, there were
no outstanding borrowings under these facilities. In addition,
we maintain an extendible commercial notes program under which
we are authorized to borrow up to $500 million. No amounts
were outstanding under this program at December 31, 2001.

We have a $2.0 billion shelf registration
statement under which we may issue debt securities in the U.S.
The debt may be denominated in a variety of currencies. There
was approximately $1.132 billion issued under this shelf
registration statement at December 31, 2001. We also
maintain a $1.0 billion European medium-term note program.
Under this program, we may issue notes from time to time,
denominated in a variety of currencies. At December 31,
2001, $1.0 billion was available under this program.

Legal
Proceedings and Contingencies

On August 9, 1999, the United States Tax
Court held that we were liable for tax on income of Overseas
Partners Ltd. (“OPL”), a Bermuda company that had
reinsured excess value (“EV”) package insurance
purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that we were
liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years. The
Court held that for the 1984 tax year we were liable for taxes
of $31 million on income reported by OPL, penalties and
penalty interest of $93 million, and interest for a total
after-tax exposure estimated at approximately $246 million.

On June 20, 2001, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the Tax Court’s
decision. On September 13, 2001, the Eleventh Circuit
denied the IRS’s petition to have the appeal reheard en
banc. The IRS did not appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court
and, consequently, the case has been remanded to the Tax Court
to consider alternative arguments raised by the parties. At this
time, we do not know what the outcome of the remanded
proceedings in the Tax Court will be.

The IRS has taken similar positions to those
advanced in the Tax Court decision for tax years subsequent to
1984. Tax years 1985 through 1990 currently are docketed in the
Tax Court, although no trial date has been

F-13

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES — (Continued)

set pending resolution of the case that covers
the 1984 year. Further, the IRS has issued a report
asserting similar positions for the 1991 through 1994 tax years,
and we expect the IRS to take similar positions for tax years
1995 through 1999. Based on the Tax Court decision, we estimate
that our total after-tax exposure for tax years 1984 through
1999 could be as high as $2.353 billion.

In our second quarter 1999 financial statements,
we recorded a tax assessment charge of $1.786 billion,
which included an amount for related state tax liabilities. The
charge included taxes of $915 million and interest of
$871 million. This assessment resulted in a tax benefit of
$344 million related to the interest component of the
assessment. As a result, our net charge to net income for the
tax assessment was $1.442 billion, increasing our total
after-tax reserve at that time with respect to these matters to
$1.672 billion. The tax benefit of deductible interest was
included in income taxes in 1999; however, since none of the
income on which this tax assessment is based is our income, we
did not classify the tax charge as income taxes.

We determine the size of our reserve with respect
to these matters in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In 1999, we
estimated our most likely liability based on the initial Tax
Court decision. In making this determination, we concluded that,
based on the Tax Court decision, it was more likely that we
would be required to pay taxes on income reported by OPL and
interest, but that it was not probable that we would be required
to pay any penalties and penalty interest. In our prior
estimation, if penalties and penalty interest ultimately were
determined to be payable, we would have had to record an
additional charge of up to $681 million. Since the outcome
of remanded proceedings in the Tax Court is uncertain, we
currently do not know what impact the Eleventh Circuit decision
ultimately will have on our recorded reserve and above
estimations for this matter.

Further, again as a result of the unfavorable Tax
Court decision, and in order to stop the potential accrual of
additional interest that might ultimately be determined to be
due to the IRS, on August 31, 1999, we paid
$1.349 billion and, on August 8, 2000, we paid an
additional $91 million, to the IRS related to these matters
for the 1984 through 1994 tax years. We included the profit of
the EV insurance program, using the IRS’s methodology for
calculating these amounts, for both 1998 and 1999 in filings we
made with the IRS in 1999. In February 2000, we paid
$339 million to the IRS related to these matters for the
1995 through 1997 tax years. These amounts will remain with the
IRS pending further proceedings.

The EV program that was the subject of the Tax
Court decision has been changed since September 1999. The
revised arrangement should eliminate the issues considered by
the Tax Court and the Eleventh Circuit related to OPL.

The IRS has proposed adjustments, unrelated to
the OPL matters discussed above, regarding the allowance of
deductions and certain losses, the characterization of expenses
as capital rather than ordinary, the treatment of certain
income, and our entitlement to the investment tax credit and the
research tax credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years. The
proposed adjustments would result in $16 million in
additional income tax expense. Also, the IRS has issued a report
taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues
for each of the years from 1991 through 1994. This report
proposes adjustments that would result in $155 million in
additional income tax expense. For the 1985 through 1994 tax
years, unpaid interest on these adjustments through
December 31, 2001 could aggregate up to approximately
$436 million, after the benefit of related tax deductions.
We expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these
issues. Specifically, we believe that our practice of expensing
the items that the IRS alleges should have been capitalized is
consistent with the practices of other industry participants.
The IRS may take similar positions with respect to some of these
issues for each of the years 1995 through 2001. The IRS’s
proposed adjustments include penalties and penalty interest. We
believe that the possibility that such penalties and penalty
interest will be sustained is remote. We believe that the
eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
or liquidity.

We are named as a defendant in twenty-five
pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection
of premiums for EV insurance in connection with package
shipments since 1984. Based on a variety of state

F-14

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES — (Continued)

and federal tort, contract and statutory claims,
these cases generally claim that we failed to remit collected EV
premiums to an independent insurer; we failed to provide
promised EV insurance; we acted as an insurer without complying
with state insurance laws and regulations; and the price for EV
insurance was excessive.

These actions were filed after the August 9,
1999 Tax Court decision. As discussed above, on June 20,
2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled
in our favor and reversed the Tax Court decision.

Twenty-four of these twenty-five cases have been
consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district
litigation proceeding (“MDL Proceeding”) in federal
court in New York. Motions to dismiss these cases are pending,
as are motions to remand several of these cases to state court.
The other pending case was filed on January 28, 2002 in
state court in Georgia. We have removed it to federal court and
are seeking to have it consolidated into the MDL Proceeding.

In addition to the cases in which UPS is named as
a defendant, there is also an action,

Smith v. Mail Boxes
Etc.,

against Mail Boxes Etc. and its franchisees relating
to UPS EV insurance purchased through Mail Boxes Etc. centers.
Although the case has been pending in California state court,
the complaint was recently amended to allege a nationwide
plaintiff class, and to add a UPS subsidiary, Mail Boxes Etc.,
Inc. (“New MBE”), and an MBE franchisee as a
representative of a purported nationwide defendant class of
franchisees, as new defendants. Previously, only the former
franchisor, which was not affiliated with UPS, was named a
defendant. New MBE has removed the case to federal court, and is
attempting to have it consolidated into the MDL Proceeding. The
plaintiff is seeking to have the case remanded back to state
court.

We believe that the allegations in these cases
have no merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously.
The ultimate resolution of these cases cannot presently be
determined.

There was an additional EV case that was pending
in state court in Madison County, Illinois (

Triad Industries,
Inc. v. UPS

). Shortly before the Eleventh Circuit reversed
the Tax Court decision, we entered into a settlement of this
case — only with respect to Illinois EV
shippers — based in part on our desire to vigorously
defend these actions in the single MDL Proceeding. While
expressly denying any and all liability, the settlement resolved
the Illinois case. This settlement has no impact on the claims
pending in the MDL Proceeding regarding EV purchases relating to
shipments from states other than Illinois. The Illinois court
held a fairness hearing on November 15, 2001, and approved
the settlement. No appeals were filed to challenge the
settlement, and the deadline to do so has passed. Under the
settlement, we will provide qualifying settlement class members
with coupons toward the purchase of specified UPS services,
subject to the terms and conditions of the settlement, and have
paid the agreed-upon plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The
settlement’s ultimate cost to us will depend upon a number
of factors. This settlement did not have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

In addition, we are a defendant in various other
lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe
that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

Employee
Benefit Plans

We maintain several defined benefit pension plans
(the “Plans”). The Plans are noncontributory and
include all employees of participating domestic subsidiaries who
meet certain minimum age and years of service requirements,
except those employees covered by certain multi-employer plans
provided for under collective bargaining agreements.

The Plans provide for retirement benefits based
on either service credits or average compensation levels earned
by employees prior to retirement. The Plans’ assets consist
primarily of publicly traded securities and include
approximately 24.1 and 24.5 million shares of UPS common
stock at December 31, 2001 and 2000,

F-15

SUBSIDIARIES — (Continued)

respectively. Our funding policy is consistent
with relevant federal tax regulations. Accordingly, our
contributions are deductible for federal income tax purposes.

We also sponsor postretirement medical plans that
provide health care benefits to our retirees who meet certain
eligibility requirements and who are not otherwise covered by
multi-employer plans. Generally, this includes employees with at
least 10 years of service who have reached age 55 and
employees who are eligible for postretirement medical benefits
from a Company-sponsored plan pursuant to collective bargaining
agreements. We have the right to modify or terminate certain of
these plans. In many cases, these benefits have been provided to
retirees on a noncontributory basis; however, in certain cases,
retirees are required to contribute toward the cost of the
coverage.

The following tables provide a reconciliation of
the changes in the plans’ benefit obligations and fair
value of assets, and a statement of funded status as of
September 30, with certain amounts included in the balance
sheet as of December 31 (in millions):

Net periodic benefit cost (benefit) for the
years ended December 31 included the following components
(in millions):

The significant assumptions used in the
measurement of our benefit obligations are as follows:

Future postretirement medical benefit costs were
forecasted assuming an initial annual increase of 7.00% for
pre-65 and post-65 medical costs, decreasing to 5.50% for pre-65
and post-65 by the year 2004 and with consistent annual
increases at those ultimate levels thereafter.

Assumed health care cost trends have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for the
postretirement medical plans. A one-percent change in assumed
health care cost trend rates would have the following effects
(in millions):

We also contribute to several multi-employer
pension plans for which the above disclosure information is not
determinable. Amounts charged to operations for pension
contributions to these multi-employer plans were $977, $897 and
$809 million during 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

We also contribute to several multi-employer
health and welfare plans that cover both active and retired
employees for which the above disclosure information is not
determinable. Amounts charged to operations for contributions to
multi-employer health and welfare plans were $553, $501, and
$463 million during 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

We also sponsor a defined contribution plan for
all employees not covered under collective bargaining
agreements. The Company matches, in shares of UPS common stock,
a portion of the participating employees’ contributions.
Matching contributions charged to expense were $71, $61 and
$55 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Note 6.

Incentive
Compensation Plan

We adopted the UPS Incentive Compensation Plan in
October 1999. The Incentive Compensation Plan permits the
grant of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted

F-17

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES — (Continued)

stock, performance shares, performance units, and
management incentive awards to eligible employees. The number of
shares reserved for issuance under the Plan is 112 million,
with the number of shares reserved for issuance as restricted
stock limited to 34 million. As of December 31, 2001,
management incentive awards, stock options, restricted stock,
and performance shares had been granted under the Incentive
Compensation Plan.

Management
Incentive Awards

Persons earning the right to receive Management
Incentive Awards are determined annually by the Compensation
Committee of the UPS Board of Directors. This Committee, in its
sole discretion, determines the total award, which consists of
UPS Class A common stock, given in any year. The total of
all such awards historically has been 15% of consolidated income
before income taxes for the 12-month period ending each
September 30, exclusive of certain nonrecurring
transactions or accounting changes. Amounts expensed for
Management Incentive Awards were $651, $735, and
$588 million during 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

Nonqualified
and Incentive Stock Options

We maintain fixed stock option plans under which
options are granted to purchase shares of UPS Class A
common stock. Prior to adoption of the Incentive Compensation
Plan, these options were granted at the current price of UPS
shares as determined by the Board of Directors on the date of
option grant. Stock options granted in connection with the
Incentive Compensation Plan must have an exercise price at least
equal to the NYSE closing price of UPS class B common stock
on the date the option was granted. We apply the measurement
provisions of APB Opinion 25 and related Interpretations in
accounting for these plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense
has been recorded for the grant of stock options during 2001,
2000 or 1999. Pro forma information regarding net income and
earnings per share has been determined as if we accounted for
our employee stock options under the fair value method of
FAS 123. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of the options granted is amortized to
expense over the vesting period of the options.

The pro forma information is as follows (in
millions except per share amounts):

The assumptions used, by year, and the calculated
weighted average fair value of options granted, are as follows:

(1)

Pro forma information for options granted
	subsequent to, or in connection with, the IPO was calculated
	using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Pro forma
	information for the options granted prior to the IPO was
	calculated using the minimum value method for nonpublic entities.

Persons earning the right to receive stock
options are determined each year by the Compensation Committee
and the UPS Board of Directors. Except in the case of death,
disability or retirement, options granted prior to the adoption
of our Incentive Compensation Plan are exercisable only during a
limited period after the expiration of five years from the date
of grant, while options granted under the Incentive Compensation
Plan are generally exercisable after three years from the date
of grant and before the expiration of the option ten years after
the date of grant. All options granted are subject to earlier
cancellation or exercise under certain conditions.

The following is an analysis of options to
purchase shares of Class A common stock issued and
outstanding:

Options were granted to eligible employees under
the 1996 Stock Option Plan in March 1999, but options will no
longer be granted under that plan. Beginning in November 1999,
options were granted under the Incentive Compensation Plan, and
a limited option grant to certain employees under this plan
occurred in

F-19

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

SUBSIDIARIES — (Continued)

2000. Beginning in 2001 and in future years,
options to eligible employees will generally be granted annually
during the first half of each year at the discretion of the
Board of Directors.

During 2001, we assumed employee stock options in
connection with our acquisitions of Fritz Companies, Inc. and
First International Bancorp, Inc. (see Note 12), which were
converted into options to purchase UPS Class A common
shares. Existing stock option plans at Fritz Companies, Inc.
were assumed by UPS; however, options will no longer be granted
under these plans. Existing stock option plans at First
International Bancorp, Inc. were terminated upon the completion
of the acquisition.

No options were exercisable at December 31,
2000 or 1999. The following table summarizes information about
stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31,
2001:

In connection with retention agreements for
certain personnel, restricted stock awards for approximately
38,000 Class A shares had been granted, but not vested, as
of December 31, 2001. These awards vest over remaining
terms of up to three years. No restricted stock awards were
granted in 2000 or 1999.

The valuation allowance decreased by $17,
increased by $21 and decreased by $25 million during the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

We have foreign loss carryforwards of
approximately $726 million as of December 31, 2001. Of
this amount, $255 million expires in varying amounts
through 2011. The remaining $471 million may be carried
forward indefinitely. These foreign loss carryforwards have been
fully reserved in the deferred tax assets valuation allowance
due to the uncertainty resulting from a lack of previous foreign
taxable income within certain foreign tax jurisdictions. In
addition, a portion of these losses has been deducted on the
U.S. tax return, which could affect the amount of any future
benefit.

Segment
and Geographic Information

We report our operations in three segments: U.S.
domestic package operations, international package operations
and non-package operations. Package operations represent our
core business and are broken down into regional operations
around the world. Regional operations managers are responsible
for both domestic and export operations within their geographic
area. International package operations include shipments wholly
outside the U.S. as well as shipments with either origin or
distribution outside the U.S. Non-package operations, which
include the UPS Logistics Group and the Forwarding and Brokerage
Services unit, are distinct from package operations and are thus
managed and reported separately. Based on the requirements of
FAS 131 “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information”, reportable segments include U.S.
domestic package operations, international package operations
and non-package operations.

In evaluating financial performance, we focus on
operating profit as a segment’s measure of profit or loss.
Operating profit is before investment income, interest expense,
and income taxes. The accounting policies of the reportable
segments are the same as those described in the summary of
accounting policies (see Note 1), with certain expenses
allocated between the segments using activity-based costing
methods.

Non-package operating profit included $113, $101,
and $108 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, of
intersegment profit, with a corresponding amount of operating
expense, which reduces operating profit, included in the U.S.
domestic package segment.

and 2000 (in millions):

Included in other debt securities in 2001 are
$19 million of retained interests in loan securitizations,
associated with our purchase of First International Bancorp,
Inc. (see Note 12). The gross realized gains on sales of
marketable securities totaled $34, $69, and $6 million in
2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. The gross realized losses
totaled $7, $35, and $12 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively. The adjustment to unrealized holding losses on
marketable securities, net of tax, included in OCI totaled $17,
$1, and $3 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of
marketable securities and short-term investments at
December 31, 2001, by contractual maturity, are shown below

Business
Combinations

We regularly explore opportunities to make
acquisitions that would enhance our core package delivery
business and our various non-package businesses. Our
acquisitions include both domestic and international
transactions. During the three years ended December 31,
2001, we completed 27 acquisitions that were accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting. In connection with the
foregoing transactions, we paid cash (net of cash acquired) in
the aggregate amount of $466, $245, and $63 million in
2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, and issued aggregate UPS
Class B common shares of 8.4 million in 2001 and none
in 2000 and 1999. Pro forma results of operations have not been
presented for any of the acquisitions because the effects of
these transactions did not meet materiality thresholds on either
an individual or aggregate basis. The results of operations of
each acquired company are included in our consolidated statement
of income from the date of acquisition. The purchase price
allocations of acquired companies can be modified up to one year
after the date of acquisition, however we expect such
adjustments to the purchase price allocations to be immaterial.

The fair value of the assets and liabilities
recorded each year as a result of these transactions is as
follows (in millions):

In April 2001, we completed our acquisition
of substantially all of the assets of Mail Boxes Etc.
(“MBE”) in a transaction in which we paid cash of
approximately $185 million. MBE is the world’s largest
franchisor of independently owned and operated business,
communication, and shipping centers worldwide. The acquisition
was accounted for as a purchase and results of operations are
included in our non-package segment.

In May 2001, we completed our acquisition of
Fritz Companies, Inc. in a transaction in which we issued
7.3 million UPS class B common shares valued at
$456 million. Fritz is a freight forwarding, customs
brokerage and logistics concern. The acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase. The results of operations of Fritz are
included in the Forwarding and Brokerage Services unit of our
non-package segment.

In August 2001, we completed our acquisition
of First International Bancorp, Inc. in a transaction in which
we issued 1.1 million UPS class B common shares valued
at $54 million. First International offers a variety of
structured trade finance, commercial and government-backed
lending products. First International was integrated with UPS
Capital Corporation, the finance subsidiary of UPS, upon the
closing of the transaction. The acquisition was accounted for as
a purchase and results of operations are included in our
non-package segment.

Derivative
Instruments and Risk Management

We are exposed to market risk, primarily related
to foreign exchange, commodity prices, equity prices and
interest rates. These exposures are actively monitored by
management. To manage the volatility relating to these
exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative financial
instruments. Our objective is to reduce, where it is deemed
appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows
associated with changes in foreign currency rates, commodity
prices, equity prices, and interest rates. It is our policy and
practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the
extent necessary to manage exposures. As we use price sensitive
instruments to hedge a certain portion of our existing and
anticipated transactions, we expect that any loss in value for
those instruments generally would be offset by increases in the
value of those hedged transactions. We do not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes.

Commodity Price Risk
	Management

We are exposed to an increase in the prices of
refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline.
Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of
other energy products, principally natural gas and electricity.
We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to
provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices.
These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted energy
consumption for periods up to one year. The net fair value of
such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying
exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was a liability
of approximately $(27) and $(5) million, respectively. We have
designated and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges,
and therefore the resulting gains and losses from these hedges
are recognized as a component of fuel expense or occupancy
expense when the underlying fuel or energy product being hedged
is consumed.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
	Management

We have foreign currency risks related to our
revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in
currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate.
We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in
functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated
assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant
foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro and the British
Pound Sterling. We use a combination of purchased and written
options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency
exposures. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the net fair
value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset
(liability) of approximately $4 and $(9) million,
respectively. We have designated and account for these contracts
as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated
revenue and, therefore, the resulting gains and losses from
these hedges are recognized as a component of international
revenue when the underlying sales occur.

Interest Rate Risk Management

Our indebtedness under our various financing
arrangements creates interest rate risk. We use a combination of
derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and
cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to
manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total
debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These
swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the
debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount,
interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the
terms of the associated debt. Interest rate swaps allow us to
maintain a target range of floating rate debt. We have
designated and account for these contracts as either hedges of
the fair value of the associated debt instruments, or as hedges
of the variability in expected future interest payments. Any
periodic settlement payments are accrued monthly, as either a
charge or credit to interest expense, and are not material to
net income. The net fair value of our interest rate swaps at
December 31, 2001 and 2000 was an asset (liability) of
approximately $(74) and $3 million, respectively.

F-26

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES — (Continued)

Equity Price Risk Management

We hold investments in various available-for-sale
equity securities which are subject to price risk. We use
combinations of options to hedge the price risk exposure
inherent in these securities. The fair value of such options
contracts designated as hedges, as of December 31, 2001 and
2000, was an asset of approximately $214 and $148 million,
respectively, which is classified in marketable securities and
short-term investments.

Credit Risk

The forward contracts, swaps, and options
previously discussed contain an element of risk that the
counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the
agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these
instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and
financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines.
We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty
default.

Additional disclosures required by FAS 133, as
amended, are provided in the following paragraphs.

Hedges of Anticipated Cash
	Flows

A reconciliation of current period changes, net
of applicable income taxes, in OCI relating to unrealized gains
(losses) on cash flow hedges is as follows (in millions):

The ineffective portion of changes in fair values
of hedge positions, reported in income, was a $2 million
loss, before income taxes, in 2001. Amounts excluded from the
measure of effectiveness, also reported in income, was a
$5 million gain, before income taxes, in 2001. The
effective portion of gains and losses on cash flow hedges are
reported in the income statement category related to the hedged
exposure. The amounts recorded in the income statement related
to ineffectiveness are reported in the same income statement
captions as the effective portion of hedging gains and losses.

Of the $49 million in net deferred losses
recorded in OCI at December 31, 2001, $27 million in
losses, before income taxes, are expected to be reclassified to
income over the 12 month period ending December 31,
2002. The actual amounts that will be reclassified to income
over the next 12 months will vary from this amount as a
result of changes in market conditions. No amounts were
reclassified to income during 2001 in connection with forecasted
transactions that were no longer considered probable of
occurring.

At December 31, 2001, the maximum term of
derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions,
except those related to cross-currency interest rate swaps on
existing financial instruments, was two years. We maintain
cross-currency interest rate swaps that extend through 2009.

Hedges of Recognized Assets, Liabilities,
	and Firm Commitments

The ineffective portion of changes in fair values
of hedge positions, reported in income, was a $2 million
loss, before income taxes, in 2001. Amounts excluded from the
measure of effectiveness, also reported in income, was a
$2 million gain, before income taxes, in 2001. The
effective portion of gains and losses on fair value hedges are
reported in the income statement category related to the hedged
exposure. The amounts recorded in the income statement related
to ineffectiveness are reported in the same income statement
captions as the effective portion of hedging gains and losses.

Derivatives Not Designated as
	Hedges

Derivatives not designated as hedges primarily
consist of interest rate swaps that are used to hedge a
portfolio of small debt instruments. Although these instruments
are effective as hedges from an economic perspective, they do
not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, as amended.
The impact from these interest rate swaps on our results was
immaterial. Additionally, we have a small portfolio of stock
warrants in public and private companies that are held for
investment purposes. These warrants are recorded at fair value,
and the income statement impact of these warrants on our results
was immaterial.

Fair Value of Financial
	Instruments

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, our financial
instruments included cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities and short-term investments, accounts receivable,
finance receivables, accounts payable, short-term and long-term
borrowings, and commodity, interest rate, foreign currency, and
equity options, forwards, and swaps. The fair values of cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable
approximate carrying values because of the short-term nature of
these instruments. The fair value of our debt instruments is
disclosed in Note 2, marketable securities and short-term
investments in Note 11, and finance receivables in

September
11, 2001 Events

In response to the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks, the FAA issued a federal ground stop order
prohibiting all flights to, from, and within the United States.
Due to this order, all domestic UPS aircraft were grounded, and
international flights into the United States were diverted, on
September 11th and 12th. We were able to transport many of
our express shipments through our extensive ground network until
the FAA order was lifted and our air operations resumed on the
evening of September 13th. Due to the economic disruption
caused by these events, we sustained significant declines in our
U.S. origin package volume during the weeks following the
attacks.

On September 22, 2001, President Bush signed
into law the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization
Act (the “Act”), a $15 billion emergency economic
assistance package to mitigate the dramatic financial losses
experienced by the nation’s air carriers. The Act, among
other things, provides for the following:
(1) $5 billion in compensation for direct losses
incurred as a result of the federal ground stop order, and for
incremental losses incurred through December 31 as a result
of the attacks, (2) $10 billion in federal loan
guarantees and credits, (3) expanded war risk insurance
coverage for air carriers, and (4) government assistance
for short-term increases in insurance premiums. We submitted a
claim for compensation to the Department of Transportation and
recognized a pre-tax amount of $74 million related to this
reimbursement as a credit to the other expenses line item of
other operating expenses (see Note 9) in 2001 under the
provisions of EITF 01-10 “Accounting for the Impact of
Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001”. We cannot be
assured of the timing or amount of any additional payments we
may be entitled to receive under the Act.
