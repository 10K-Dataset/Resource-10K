PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

We are the world’s largest package delivery
company and a leading global provider of specialized
transportation and logistics services. We were founded in 1907
as a private messenger and delivery service in the Seattle,
Washington area. Over the past 97 years, we have expanded
from a small regional parcel delivery service into a global
company. We deliver packages each business day for 1.8 million
shipping customers to 6.1 million consignees. In 2003, we
delivered an average of more than 13 million pieces per day
worldwide. Total revenue in 2003 was over $33 billion. We
focus on the movement of goods, information and funds, and we
seek to synchronize the world of commerce.

Our primary business is the time-definite
delivery of packages and documents throughout the United States
and in over 200 other countries and territories. We have
established a global transportation infrastructure and developed
a comprehensive portfolio of guaranteed delivery services, and
we support these services with advanced technology. We provide
integrated supply chain solutions for major companies worldwide.
We are the industry leader in the delivery of goods purchased
over the Internet.

Competitive
Strengths

Our competitive strengths include:

Global Reach and Scale.

We believe that our integrated global
ground and air network is the most extensive in the industry. We
operate a ground fleet of more than 88,000 vehicles, ranging
from custom-built delivery vehicles to large tractors and
trailers, and almost 600 airplanes. In the U.S., we estimate
that our integrated door-to-door delivery system carries goods
having a value in excess of 6% of the U.S. gross domestic
product, or 2% of the world’s GDP, and we reach all U.S.
businesses and residential addresses. We are the ninth largest
airline in North America and eleventh largest in the world. Our
primary air hub is located in Louisville, Kentucky.

We established our first European operation in
Germany in 1975 and expanded it as the single market created by
the European Union drove the need for pan-European delivery
services. We believe we have the most comprehensive integrated
delivery and information services portfolio of any carrier in
Europe.

Through more than two dozen alliances with Asian
delivery companies that supplement company-owned operations, we
currently serve more than 40 Asia Pacific countries and
territories. With among the fastest growing economies in the
world, China and India represent two of our most promising
opportunities.

We also are the largest air cargo carrier and a
leading logistics provider in Latin America and the Caribbean.
We have formed alliances with a number of service providers in
countries throughout that region.

Our Canadian operations include both intra-Canada
and import/export capabilities, effectively linking two of the
world’s most significant trading partners — U.S.
and Canada. We offer delivery to all addresses throughout
Canada, and we are the only carrier to offer guaranteed
8:00 a.m. delivery next day to all major Canadian cities.

Technology Systems.

We continue to be a global leader in
merging technology with business processes to improve operations
and provide new or enhanced services to customers worldwide. We
have developed a strong global capability as a mover of
electronic information. We daily transmit approximately
3 million packets of tracking data via wireless networks,
and we currently collect electronic data on 93% of the packages
that move through our U.S. system each day — more than
any of our competitors.

In 2003 we announced plans for significant
improvements to our package sorting and delivery systems. We
expect to invest $600 million over the next several years
to simplify and optimize our package sorting and delivery
systems, which we believe will result in significant gains in
efficiency, reliability and flexibility. Once the systems are
fully deployed in over 1,000 of our package sorting facilities,
which we estimate to be



completed in 2007, we anticipate achieving
reductions in operating costs of approximately $600 million
annually. These savings will be realized through productivity
improvements, as well as in savings resulting from driving an
estimated 100 million fewer miles each year.

Technology powers virtually every service we
offer and every operation we perform. Our technology initiatives
continue to be driven by the needs of customers. We provide the
infrastructure for an Internet presence that extends to more
than 60,000 customer web sites that integrate UPS® tools.
We offer a variety of on-line service options that enable our
customers to integrate UPS functionality into their own
businesses not only to conveniently send, manage and track
their shipments, but to provide their own customers with better
information services.

E-Commerce Capabilities.

We are a leading participant in and
facilitator of global e-commerce, which we define as the use of
networked computer technology to facilitate the three flows of
commerce: funds, goods and information. According to Forrester
Research, by 2008, online retail sales should reach
$230 billion. Forrester Research also reports that online
retail sales will grow to $123 billion in 2004. We enable
our customers around the world to thrive in this environment by
providing a portfolio of technology solutions that streamline
their shipment processing and integrate critical transportation
information into their business processes.

Broad, Flexible Range of Distribution
Services.

Our portfolio of services
enables customers to choose the delivery option that is most
appropriate for their requirements. All of our delivery service
offerings are guaranteed.

Our express air services are integrated with our
vast ground delivery system. This integrated air and ground
network enhances efficiency, improves productivity and provides
us with the flexibility to transport packages using the most
reliable and cost-effective transportation mode or combination
of modes. Our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to
optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily
basis.

Customer Relationships.

We focus on building and maintaining
long-term customer relationships. We deliver an average of more
than 13 million packages each business day for 1.8 million
shipping customers to 6.1 million consignees. In addition to
daily pick-up, thousands of customers access us daily through
UPS On-Call Pickup

SM

for air delivery services, about
45,000 drop-boxes, over 8,000 independently owned authorized
shipping outlets, and more than 3,000 independently owned and
operated The UPS Store

TM

locations

We place significant value on the quality of our
customer relationships, and we conduct comprehensive research to
monitor customer perceptions. Since 1993, we have conducted
telephone interviews with shipping decision-makers virtually
every business day to determine their satisfaction with small
package carriers and perception of performance on 17 key
categories of service factors. Results from this survey for the
second half of 2003 were the highest we have ever achieved.

Brand Equity.

We
have built the leading and most trusted brand in our industry.
Our reputation for quality service, reliability and product
innovation is unmatched. The distinctive appearance of our
vehicles and the friendliness and helpfulness of our drivers are
major contributors to our brand equity.

In 2003 we introduced our first new logo in
42 years. The change was more than cosmetic; it signals our
commitment to provide more comprehensive solutions to meet our
customers’ needs and to be the leader of the broader
business arena of synchronized commerce.

Distinctive People and Culture.

We believe that the dedication of our
employees results in large part from our distinctive
“employee-owner” concept. Our employee stock ownership
tradition dates from 1927, when our founders, who believed that
employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful
business, first offered stock to employees. To facilitate
employee stock ownership, we maintain several stock-based
compensation programs.

Our long-standing policy of “promotion from
within” complements our tradition of employee ownership,
and this policy makes it generally unnecessary for us to hire
managers and executive officers from outside UPS. The vast
majority of our management team began their careers as full-time
or part-time hourly UPS



employees, and have since spent their entire
careers with us. Our chief executive officer and many of our
executive officers have more than 30 years of service with
us and have accumulated a meaningful ownership stake in our
company. Therefore, our executive officers have a strong
incentive to effectively manage UPS, which benefits all of our
shareowners.

Financial Strength.

Our balance sheet reflects financial
strength that few companies can match. As of December 31,
2003, we had a balance of cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities and short-term investments of approximately
$4.0 billion and shareowners’ equity of
$14.9 billion. Long-term debt was $3.1 billion. We
carry long-term debt ratings of AAA/Aaa from Standard and
Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively. Our financial
strength gives us the resources to achieve global scale and to
make investments in technology, transportation equipment and
buildings in our existing businesses as well as to pursue
strategic opportunities which will facilitate our growth.

Growth
Strategy

Our growth strategy takes advantage of our
competitive strengths while maintaining our focus on meeting or
exceeding our customers’ requirements. The principal
components of our growth strategy are:

Build on Our Leadership Position in Our U.S.
Business.

Our
U.S. package operation is the foundation of our business. We
believe that our tradition of reliable package delivery service,
our experienced and dedicated employees and our unmatched
integrated air and ground network provide us with the advantages
of reputation, service quality and economies of scale that
differentiate us from our competitors. Our strategy is to
increase core domestic revenues through cross-selling our
existing and new services to our large and diverse customer
base, to limit the rate of expense growth and to employ
technology-driven efficiencies to increase operating profit.

Our vision is to continue growing UPS’s
package business by leading the transformation of supply chain
management into the broader business arena of synchronized
commerce, where the flow of goods, information and funds are
seamlessly connected to help our customers grow their businesses.

Continue International Expansion.

We have built a strong international
presence through significant investments over a number of
decades. The international package delivery market has grown,
and continues to grow, at a faster rate than the U.S. market. We
plan to utilize our worldwide infrastructure and broad product
portfolio to continue to grow high-margin premium services and
to implement cost, process and technology improvements in our
international operations.

Europe is our largest region outside the United
States, followed by Asia. Both of these regions offer
significant opportunities for growth. The expansion of the
European Union to include several Eastern European and Baltic
countries will create even greater economic cohesion. Growth in
Asia will be driven by improving demographic and economic trends
throughout the region, with specific emphasis on China and India.

Provide Comprehensive Supply Chain Solutions.

Many businesses outsource the
management of all or part of their supply chains to streamline
and gain efficiencies, to strengthen their balance sheets, to
support new business models and to improve service.
Companies’ global supply chains are growing increasingly
complicated. They are vulnerable to significant disruptions and
increased regulations. This is creating further demand for a
global service offering that incorporates transportation,
distribution and international trade services with financial and
information services. We believe that we are well positioned to
capitalize on this growth for the following reasons:

•

We manage supply chains for major companies in
    120 countries, with about 25 million square feet of
    distribution space and over 750 facilities worldwide.

•

We focus on technology, supply chain redesign,
    and management-based solutions for our customers rather than
    solely on more traditional asset-based logistics such as
    warehouses and vehicle fleets. We have built valuable
    intellectual capital in specific high growth industries such as
    healthcare and high-tech.



•

We provide a broad range of transportation
    solutions to customers worldwide, including air, ocean and
    ground freight, as well as customs brokerage and trade and
    materials management. We provide standardized service and
    specialized distribution facilities and services adapted to the
    unique supply chains of specific industries such as healthcare,
    high-tech, consumer retail and automotive.

•

We offer a portfolio of financial services that
    provide customers with short- and long-term financing, secured
    lending, working capital, government guaranteed lending, lines
    of credit, global trade financing, credit cards and equipment
    leasing.

Leverage Our Leading-Edge Technology and
E-Commerce
Advantage.

We
believe that e-commerce will drive smaller and more frequent
shipments and provide a strong complement to our core delivery
service offerings.

Our goals are to provide our customers with
easy-to-use, flexible technology offerings that streamline their
shipment processing and integrate critical transportation
information into their business processes, helping them create
supply chain efficiencies, improve their cash flows and serve
their customers. Our leading-edge technology has enabled our
e-commerce partners to integrate our shipping functionality and
information solutions into their e-commerce product suites. Our
partners’ products are being installed throughout the
Internet, and we expect these integrated systems to provide us
with a competitive advantage as they allow our customers to
provide better decision-making information and improve customer
service.

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Global
Alliances.

Strategic acquisitions and
global alliances play a significant role in spurring growth. We
look for opportunities that:

Domestic
Package Products and Services

For most of our history, we have been engaged
primarily in the delivery of packages traveling by ground
transportation. We expanded this service gradually, and today
our standard ground service is available to every address in the
48 contiguous United States. We handle packages that weigh up to
150 pounds and are up to 165 inches in combined length and girth.

In addition to our standard ground delivery
product,

UPS Hundredweight Service

® offers
discounted rates to customers sending multiple package shipments
having a combined weight of 200 pounds or more, or air shipments
totaling 100 pounds or more, addressed to one recipient at one
address and shipped on the same day. Customers may realize
significant savings on these shipments compared to
less-than-truckload or air freight forwarder published rates.

We provide domestic air delivery throughout the
United States.

UPS Next Day Air

® offers guaranteed
next business day delivery by 10:30 a.m. to more than 74% of the
United States population and delivery by noon to areas covering
an additional 15% of the population. We offer Saturday delivery
for UPS Next Day Air shipments for an additional fee.

We offer additional services, such as Consignee
Billing, Quantum View Manage, Delivery Confirmation and UPS
Returns

SM

, to customers that require customized
package distribution solutions.

International
Package Products and Services

We deliver international shipments to more than
200 countries and territories worldwide, and we provide
guaranteed overnight delivery to the world’s major business
centers. We offer a complete portfolio of import, export and
domestic services. This portfolio includes guaranteed 8:00 a.m.,
8:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m. and



12:00 p.m. next business day delivery to
major cities around the world, as well as scheduled day-definite
air and ground services. We offer complete customs clearance
service for any mode of transportation, regardless of carrier.

We also have a portfolio of UPS domestic services
in 20 major countries throughout the world, which provide our
customers time-definite delivery options for packages moving
between points within those countries.

Europe is our largest region outside the United
States. Transborder services, or the movement of packages within
the European Union, are proving to be the growth engine in this
region. To accommodate growth opportunities across the whole of
Europe, we have expanded and further automated our major air hub
in Cologne, Germany.

We continue to invest in infrastructure and
technology in Asia. In April 2002, we opened a new intra-Asia
hub at Clark Air Force Base in Pampanga, Philippines to enable
future growth in the region. This hub allows us to compete more
effectively in the Asian express market and improve our
Europe/Asia service. We previously acquired landing slots on the
new runway at Tokyo’s Narita Airport, which have resulted
in enhanced access and connections to the intra-Asia hub. We
received from the U.S. Department of Transportation the
authority to expand service to and through Hong Kong, including
permanent authority to fly from Hong Kong to other cities,
specifically to our Cologne hub in Europe. This routing was
implemented in October 2003. In addition, Thailand was directly
linked to the intra-Asia network with new flights beginning in
October 2003. We continue our development efforts in the
fast-growing China market.

We believe that there is long-term potential for
us to expand our service offerings in Latin America. To this
end, we have realigned our delivery capabilities between key
cities in the Mercosur and other trade blocs and continue to
benefit from our Americas International Gateway in Miami,
Florida. This gateway complements our operations in Florida and
Latin America and represents our commitment to the Americas
market.

Mexico and Canada are also important to our
international activity. We created UPS Trade Direct

SM

Cross Border service to manage movements to the U.S. from these
countries. This service combines UPS’s small package,
freight and brokerage capabilities to create an integrated,
streamlined and economical door-to-door solution for customers
with complex cross-border distribution needs.

We also have introduced UPS Trade Direct
Ocean™, a service that transforms ocean container movements
into pre-labeled small packages or less-than-truckload
shipments. When the goods arrive in the U.S., packages are
deconsolidated and entered into the UPS system, eliminating the
receiving, sorting and handling necessary in distribution
centers. This service significantly cuts the supply chain cycle
from point of origin to consignee. It also provides our
customers with faster time to market, reduced costs, increased
visibility and better management of their global supply chain.

The Trade Direct portfolio of services reflects
both our small package and supply chain solutions capabilities,
uniquely combined to provide new value to our customers.

Electronic
Services

We provide a variety of UPS on-line solutions
that support automated shipping and tracking.

Our website strategy is to provide our customers
with the convenience of all the functions that they otherwise
would perform over the phone or at one of our shipping outlets.
Package tracking, pick-up requests, rate quotes, account
opening, wireless registration, drop-off locator, transit times
and supply ordering services all are available at the
customer’s desktop. The site also displays full domestic
and international service information.

UPS.com®

receives more than 115 million hits and processes over
9.1 million package tracking transactions daily. A growing
number of those tracking requests now come from customers in the
35 countries that have wireless access to UPS tracking
information. Businesses in 46 countries also can download UPS
OnLine Tools™ to their own websites for direct use by their
customers. This allows users to access the information they need
without leaving our customers’ websites.

Sales and
Marketing

The UPS worldwide sales organization includes
both our traditional U.S. domestic and international small
package delivery business and our Supply Chain Solutions group.
Globally, we have 5,700 direct sales resources.

This field sales organization consists primarily
of locally based account executives assigned to our individual
operating units. For our largest multi-shipping site customers,
we manage sales through an organization of regionally based
account managers, reporting directly to our corporate office.

Our sales force also includes specialized groups
that work together with our general sales organization to
support the sale of e-commerce and customer technology
solutions, international package delivery, LTL and freight
transportation, and warehousing and distribution services.

Our worldwide marketing organization also
supports both our traditional U.S. domestic and
international small package delivery business and our Supply
Chain Solutions group. Our corporate marketing function is
engaged in market and customer research, brand management,
rate-making and revenue management policy,



new product development, product portfolio
management, marketing alliances and e-commerce, including the
non-technical aspects of our web presence. Advertising, public
relations, and most formal marketing communications are
centrally developed and controlled.

In addition to our corporate marketing group,
field-based marketing personnel are assigned to our individual
operating units, and are primarily engaged in business planning,
bid preparation and revenue management activities. These local
marketing teams support the execution corporate initiatives
while also managing limited promotional and public relations
activities pertinent to their local markets.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, we had
approximately 355,000 employees.

We have received numerous awards and wide
recognition as an employer-of-choice, including the following:

As of December 31, 2003, we had
approximately 228,000 employees (64% of our total employees)
employed under a national master agreement and various
supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”).
These agreements run through July 31, 2008. The majority of
our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement
with the Independent Pilots Association, which became amendable
January 1, 2004. Negotiations are ongoing with the
assistance of the National Mediation Board. Our airline
mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with
Teamsters Local 2727, which becomes amendable on
November 1, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground
mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the
Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements
with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009.

We believe that our relations with our employees
are good.

Competition

We are the largest package delivery company in
the world, in terms of both revenue and volume. We offer a broad
array of services in the package delivery industry and,
therefore, compete with many different companies and services on
a local, regional, national and international basis. Our
competitors include the postal services of the United States and
other nations, various motor carriers, express companies,
freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our major
competitors include the United States Postal Service, FedEx, DHL
Worldwide Express, Deutsche Post and TNT Post Group.

We believe competition increasingly is based on a
carrier’s ability to integrate its distribution and
information systems with its customers’ systems to provide
unique transportation solutions at competitive prices. We rely
on our vast infrastructure and service portfolio to attract and
maintain customers. As we



expand our supply chain and other non-package
businesses, we compete with a number of participants in the
supply chain, financial services and information technology
industries.

Government
Regulation

Both the U.S. Department of Transportation and
the Federal Aviation Administration regulate air transportation
services.

The DOT’s authority primarily relates to
economic aspects of air transportation, such as discriminatory
pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and
cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates, subject to the
authority of the President of the United States, international
routes, fares, rates and practices, and is authorized to
investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of
U.S. air carriers abroad. We are subject to U.S. customs laws
and related DOT regulations regarding the import and export of
shipments to and from the U.S. In addition, our customs
brokerage entities are subject to those same laws and
regulations as they relate to the filing of documents on behalf
of client importers and exporters.

The FAA’s authority primarily relates to
safety aspects of air transportation, including aircraft
standards and maintenance, personnel and ground facilities. In
1988, the FAA granted us an operating certificate, which remains
in effect so long as we meet the operational requirements of
federal aviation regulations.

The FAA has issued rules mandating repairs on all
Boeing Company and McDonnell-Douglas Corporation aircraft that
have completed a specified number of flights, and also has
issued rules requiring a corrosion control program for Boeing
Company aircraft. Our total expenditures under these programs
for 2003 were about $8 million. The future cost of repairs
pursuant to these programs may fluctuate. All mandated repairs
have been completed, or are scheduled to be completed, within
the timeframes specified by the FAA.

Our ground transportation of packages in the U.S.
is subject to the DOT’s jurisdiction with respect to the
regulation of routes and to both the DOT’s and the
states’ jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of
safety, insurance and hazardous materials.

We are subject to similar regulation in many
non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S.
government regulation of aviation rights to and beyond non-U.S.
jurisdictions, and non-U.S. customs regulation.

The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created the
U.S. Postal Service as an independent establishment of the
executive branch of the federal government, and vested the power
to recommend domestic postal rates in a regulatory body, the
Postal Rate Commission. We participate in the proceedings before
the Postal Rate Commission in an attempt to secure fair postal
rates for competitive services.

We are subject to numerous other laws and
regulations in connection with our non-package businesses,
including customs regulations, Food and Drug Administration
regulation of our transportation of pharmaceuticals and state
and federal lending regulations.

Properties

Operating
Facilities

We own our headquarters, which are located in
Atlanta, Georgia and consist of about 735,000 square feet of
office space on an office campus, and our UPS Supply Chain
Solutions group’s headquarters, which are located in
Alpharetta, Georgia and consist of about 310,000 square feet of
office space.

We also own our 27 principal U.S. package
operating facilities, which have floor spaces that range from
about 310,000 to 693,000 square feet. In addition, we have a
1.9 million square foot operating facility near Chicago,
Illinois, which is designed to streamline shipments between East
Coast and West Coast destinations, and we own or lease over
1,000 additional smaller package operating facilities in the
U.S. The smaller of these facilities have vehicles and drivers
stationed for the pickup of packages and facilities for the
sorting, transfer and delivery of packages. The larger of these
facilities also service our vehicles and equipment and employ
specialized mechanical installations for the sorting and
handling of packages.



We own or lease almost 600 facilities that
support our international package operations and over
750 facilities that support our non-package operations. Our
non-package operations maintain facilities with about 25 million
square feet of floor space.

We believe that our facilities are adequate to
support our current operations.

Our aircraft are operated in a hub and spokes
pattern in the U.S. Our principal air hub in the U.S. is located
in Louisville, Kentucky, with regional air hubs in Columbia,
South Carolina; Dallas, Texas; Hartford, Connecticut; Ontario,
California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Rockford, Illinois.
These hubs house facilities for the sorting, transfer and
delivery of packages. Our European air hub is located in
Cologne, Germany, and our Asia-Pacific air hub is located in
Taipei, Taiwan. Our intra-Asia air hub is located at Clark Air
Force Base in Pampanga, Philippines, and our regional air hub in
Canada is located in Hamilton, Ontario.

Our computer operations are consolidated in a
435,000 square foot owned facility, the Ramapo Ridge facility,
which is located on a 39-acre site in Mahwah, New Jersey. We
also own a 175,000 square foot facility located on a 25-acre
site in Alpharetta, Georgia, which serves as a backup to the
main computer operations facility in New Jersey. This facility
provides production functions and backup capacity in the event
that a power outage or other disaster incapacitates the main
data center. It also helps us to meet communication needs.

Fleet

Aircraft

The following table shows information about our
aircraft fleet as of December 31, 2003:

We maintain an inventory of spare engines and
parts for each aircraft.

All of the aircraft we own meet Stage III
federal noise regulations and can operate at airports that have
aircraft noise restrictions. We became the first major airline
to successfully operate a 100% Stage III fleet more than
three years in advance of the date required by federal
regulations.

During 2003, we took delivery of eight Airbus
A300-600 aircraft and six Boeing MD-11 aircraft. We have firm
commitments to purchase three Boeing MD-11 aircraft in 2004 and
58 Airbus A300-600 aircraft between 2004 and 2009. We expect to
take delivery of four Boeing MD-11 aircraft and eight Airbus
A300-600 aircraft during 2004. We also have options to purchase
18 Boeing MD-11 aircraft between 2005 and 2010 and
42 Airbus A300-600 aircraft between 2004 and 2012.

Vehicles

We operate a ground fleet of more than 88,000
package cars, vans, tractors and motorcycles.



Our ground support fleet consists of over 25,000
pieces of equipment designed specifically to support our
aircraft fleet, ranging from non-powered container dollies and
racks to powered aircraft main deck loaders and cargo tractors.
We also have about 31,000 containers used to transport cargo in
our aircraft.

Safety

We promote safety throughout our operations.

Our Automotive Fleet Safety Program is built with
the following components:

Our workplace safety program is built upon a
comprehensive health and safety process. The foundation of this
process is our employee-management health and safety committees.
The workplace safety process focuses on employee conditioning
and safety-related habits. Our employee co-chaired health and
safety committees complete comprehensive facility audits and
injury analyses, and recommend facility and work process changes.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are named as a defendant in twenty-three
pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection
of premiums for excess value (“EV”) insurance in
connection with package shipments since 1984. Based on state and
federal tort, contract and statutory claims, these cases
generally claim that we failed to remit collected EV premiums to
an independent insurer; we failed to provide promised EV
insurance; we acted as an insurer without complying with state
insurance laws and regulations; and the price for EV insurance
was excessive.

These actions all were filed after the
August 9, 1999 United States Tax Court decision, in which
the Tax Court held that we were liable for tax on income of
Overseas Partners Ltd., a Bermuda company that had reinsured EV
insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that
we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax
years. On June 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the Tax Court
decision. In January 2003, we and the IRS finalized settlement
of all outstanding tax issues relating to EV package insurance.

These twenty-three cases have been consolidated
for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation proceeding
(“MDL Proceeding”) in federal court in New York. In
addition to the cases in which UPS is named as a defendant,
there also is an action,

Smith v. Mail Boxes Etc.,

against Mail Boxes Etc. and its franchisees relating to UPS EV
insurance and related services purchased through Mail Boxes Etc.
centers. This case also has been consolidated into the MDL
Proceeding.



While expressly denying any and all liability,
the parties have obtained preliminary court approval of a global
settlement resolving all claims and all cases in the MDL
Proceeding. The proposed settlement requires several steps
before it becomes final, including notice to the settlement
class, and obtaining final court approval. If the proposed
settlement becomes final, we would provide to qualifying
settlement class members vouchers toward the purchase of
specified UPS services and pay a portion of the plaintiffs’
attorneys’ fees, the total amount of which will be
determined by the Court. The ultimate cost to us of the proposed
settlement will depend on a number of factors. We do not believe
that this proposed settlement will have a material effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

In addition, we are a defendant in various other
lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe
that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

We participate in a number of trustee-managed
multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for
employees covered under collective bargaining agreements.
Several factors could result in higher future contributions to
these plans, including unfavorable investment performance,
changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants.
At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of
additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flows could result from our participation in
these plans.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In the discussion and analysis below and in
“Selected Financial Data”, we sometimes refer to
information extracted from consolidated financial information
but not required by generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) to be presented in financial statements. Certain of this
information is considered “non-GAAP financial
measures” under Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
Specifically, we refer to operating profit, operating margin,
net income and earnings per share on an “as adjusted”
basis, excluding certain transactions that we believe are not
indicative of future results. We have presented these measures
since we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial
performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying
that performance and our judgments about the likelihood that
particular factors will repeat. When these “non-GAAP
financial measures” have been used, we have provided
reconciliations of these adjusted measures to the appropriate
GAAP measure for comparability purposes.

U.S. Domestic Package
    Operations

2003 compared to 2002

U.S. domestic package revenue increased
$1.098 billion, or 4.6%, for the year, which was driven by
a 2.1% increase in average daily package volume and a 2.6%
increase in revenue per piece. Ground volume increased by 1.5%
in 2003, reversing a 2.0% decline in 2002, reflecting the
improving U.S. economy and the impact that labor
negotiations had on lowering volume during portions of 2002. The
volume for our UPS Next Day Air products increased by 6.7%
during the year, driven by double-digit growth in overnight
letters which was influenced by the strength in mortgage
refinancing activity during 2003. The increase in
U.S. domestic average daily package volume was more
significant in the latter half of the year. In the third and
fourth quarters of 2003, total U.S. domestic average daily
package volume increased 3.2% and 4.9%, respectively.

The overall improvement in revenue per piece was
primarily due to the rate increase that became effective in
January 2003, with some additional benefit from the fuel
surcharge as described below. The decline in revenue per piece
for the Next Day Air products, and the relatively smaller
increase for the deferred products, was primarily due to the
relatively higher growth in letter volume compared with the
growth in package volume for these products.



On January 6, 2003, we increased rates for
standard ground shipments an average of 3.9% for commercial
deliveries. The ground residential surcharge increased $0.05 to
$1.15 over the commercial ground rate. The additional delivery
area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain ZIP
codes increased $0.25 to $1.75. Rates for UPS Hundredweight
increased 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day
Air an average of 3.4% and increased rates for deferred services
by 4.5%.

Rates for international shipments originating in
the United States (UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express
Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS Standard service)
increased an average of 3.9%. Rate changes for shipments
originating outside the United States generally are made
throughout the year and vary by geographic market.

During 2003, the index-based fuel surcharge reset
on a monthly basis and was based on the National
U.S. Average On-Highway Diesel Fuel Prices as reported by
the U.S. Department of Energy. Based on published rates,
the average fuel surcharge increased to 1.47% in 2003 from 0.78%
in 2002, resulting in an increase in fuel surcharge revenue of
$144 million. Effective in 2004, we have discontinued the
fuel surcharge on ground service, while a new indexed surcharge
is being applied to our Next Day Air and deferred products. This
new fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the
U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a
gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. This change will have a
negative impact on revenue for our ground products, while having
a beneficial impact on revenue for our Next Day Air and deferred
products.

U.S. domestic package operating profit
declined $304 million, or 8.5%, primarily due to the slow
volume and revenue growth combined with an increase in operating
expenses (discussed further below under the section titled
“operating expenses and operating margin”).
U.S. domestic package operating profit increased 2.0% in
the third quarter and decreased by 9.4% in the fourth quarter.
However, in the fourth quarter of 2002, U.S. domestic
package operating profit benefited from a $175 million
credit due to a change in our vacation policy for non-union
employees. Without the vacation-related credit in the 2002
results, fourth quarter operating profit would have increased
9.6% and the decline for the year ending December 31, 2003
would have been $129 million, or 3.8%.

2002 compared to 2001

U.S. domestic package revenue decreased
$73 million, or 0.3%, for the year. This decrease was
driven by a 1.9% decrease in average daily package volume, and
partially offset by a 1.6% increase in revenue per piece. The
decline in volume was a result of the impact of volume diversion
to competitors prior to the agreement reached on a new six-year
contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
combined with the continued weakness in the U.S. economy.
The decline in volume was most pronounced in the period
surrounding the July 31, 2002 expiration date of the
previous contract.

On January 7, 2002, we increased rates for
standard ground shipments an average of 3.5% for commercial
deliveries. The ground residential charge increased $0.05 to
$1.10 over the commercial ground rate, and this charge also was
applied to express deliveries in 2002. The additional delivery
area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain ZIP
codes, remained at $1.50, and also was applied to express
deliveries in 2002. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%.

We also increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS
Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air, and 3 Day Select an
average of 4.0%. The surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M.
increased from $27.50 to $28.50. Rates for international
shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express,
Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS
International Standard service) increased an average of 3.9%.
Rate changes for shipments originating outside the
U.S. were made throughout 2002 and varied by geographic
market.

An index-based fuel surcharge, which began in
February 2002 and reset on a monthly basis, replaced a fixed
fuel surcharge of 1.25%. The indexed surcharge was based on the
National U.S. Average On-Highway Diesel Fuel Prices as
reported by the U.S. Department of Energy. Based on
published rates, the average fuel surcharge for the year ended
December 31, 2002 was 0.78%. Approximately
$251 million in revenue was recorded in 2002 as a result of
our fuel surcharge, a decrease of $97 million from the
prior year.



U.S. domestic package operating profit
decreased $44 million, or 1.2%, for 2002, primarily due to
the decrease in average daily volume discussed previously and an
increase in operating expenses (discussed further below). In
2002, operating profit benefited from a credit to operating
expense of $175 million that occurred related to a change
in our vacation policy for non-union employees. In 2001, we
recorded a credit to expense related to the Air Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act, which benefited the
U.S. domestic package segment by $28 million.

International Package
    Operations

2003 compared to 2002

International package revenue improved
$881 million, or 18.8%, for the year due primarily to the
8.6% volume growth for our export products and strong revenue
per piece improvements, a portion of which can be attributed to
the impact of currency. Revenue increased $443 million
during the year due to currency fluctuations. Export volume
increased throughout the world, with Asia-Pacific, Canada, and
the Americas showing double-digit export volume growth, and U.S.
and European export volume increasing slightly over 6%. European
export volume growth was adversely impacted by the strength of
the Euro and the weak European economy. Domestic volume
increased 0.9% for the year, which reverses a 3.2% decline from
the previous year, and was also negatively affected by the weak
European economy.

Export revenue per piece increased 12.5% for the
year (3.3% currency-adjusted), due to improvements in product
mix and continued focus on yield management. In total,
international average daily package volume increased 3.7% and
average revenue per piece increased 17.4% (6.2%
currency-adjusted). The 7.6% decline in cargo revenue during the
year was largely due to a reduction of flights in our air
network in the Americas.

The improvement in operating profit for our
international package operations was $387 million for the
year, $117 million of which was due to favorable currency
fluctuations. This increase in operating profit was primarily
due to the strong export volume growth and revenue per piece
increases described previously. In 2002, international operating
profit benefited from an $11 million credit to operating
expense as a result of a change in our vacation policy for
non-union employees.

2002 compared to 2001

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
international package revenue improved $435 million, or
10.2% (8.1% currency-adjusted), due primarily to volume growth
for our export products and strong revenue per piece
improvements. This volume growth was driven primarily by the
Asia-Pacific region, which had an increase in average daily
export volume of 17.1%, and the Europe region, which had an
increase in average daily export volume of 13.6%. In total,
international average daily package volume increased 0.7% and
average revenue per piece increased 9.1% (6.8%
currency-adjusted).

The improvement in operating profit for our
international package operations was $197 million for the
year, $22 million of which was due to currency
fluctuations. The increase in operating profit was primarily due
to export volume growth of 8.6% and a strong increase in revenue
per piece. In addition, the shutdown of the U.S. West Coast
ports during the latter part of 2002 had a beneficial impact on
our international package results. In 2002, operating profit
benefited from an $11 million reduction to expense related
to the change in vacation policy. Operating profit in 2002
benefited, compared with 2001, from an $11 million
reduction of expense due to the elimination of goodwill
amortization. In 2001, operating profit benefited from a
$46 million credit to expense related to the Air
Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act.

Non-Package Operations

2003 compared to 2002

Non-package revenue increased $234 million,
or 8.8%, for the year. UPS Supply Chain Solutions, which
comprises our former UPS Freight Services and UPS Logistics
Group businesses, increased revenue by 8.0% during the year.
This increase was due to growth in our supply chain management
and other logistics businesses, with international revenues
growing faster than in the U.S., partially as a result of
favorable



currency fluctuations. Favorable currency
fluctuations accounted for $74 million of the increase in
revenue. Freight forwarding revenue increased at a slower rate,
which was influenced by global economic conditions and increased
air revenue in 2002 as a result of the work disruption at
U.S. west coast ports. The remainder of our non-package
operations, which includes Mail Boxes Etc. (the franchisor of
Mail Boxes Etc. and The UPS Store), UPS Capital Corp., our mail
and consulting services and our excess value package insurance
business, increased revenue by 11.0% for the year, primarily due
to increased franchise revenue at Mail Boxes Etc. and strong
results from our Mail Innovations unit.

Non-package operating profit increased
$266 million, or 134.3%, for the year. This increase was
primarily due to higher operating profit from our Supply Chain
Solutions unit, which was driven by the increase in revenue as
well as the cost savings produced by our integration and
restructuring program. Non-package operating profit in 2002 was
reduced by the $106 million restructuring charge and
related expenses, and was increased by $11 million due to
the change in our vacation policy for non-union employees.
Non-package operating profit includes $114 million
(compared to $112 million in 2002) of intersegment profit,
with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces
operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment.

During 2003, we sold our Mail Technologies
business unit in a transaction that increased net income by
$14 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. The gain
consisted of a pre-tax loss of $24 million recorded in
other operating expenses within the non-package segment, and a
tax benefit of $38 million recognized in conjunction with
the sale. The tax benefit exceeds the pre-tax loss from this
sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we
previously recorded for the Mail Technologies business unit was
not deductible for income tax purposes. Consequently, our tax
basis was greater than our book basis, thus producing the tax
benefit described above.

Also during 2003, we sold our Aviation
Technologies business unit and recognized a pre-tax gain of
$24 million ($15 million after-tax, or $0.01 per
diluted share), which is recorded in other operating expenses
within the non-package segment. The operating results of both
the Mail Technologies unit and the Aviation Technologies unit
were previously included in our non-package segment, and were
not material to non-package operating results in any of the
periods presented.

2002 compared to 2001

Non-package revenue increased $589 million,
or 28.3% during 2002. 20.4% of this revenue growth was due to
acquisitions and the remaining 7.9% was due to organic growth.

UPS Supply Chain Solutions revenue was up
$490 million, or 33.1%, for the year, much of which was due
to having a full year of revenue from Fritz Companies Inc.,
which we acquired in May 2001, and other acquisitions. Revenue
growth at Supply Chain Solutions was hindered by the sale of the
FedEx brokerage business in March 2002. Excluding the impact of
acquisitions and dispositions, UPS Supply Chain Solutions would
have reported revenue growth of approximately 8% during 2002.

Non-package operating profit decreased by
$19 million, or 8.8%, for the year. In 2002, operating
profit was affected by a restructuring charge and related
expenses of $106 million primarily related to the
integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group
operations, and an $11 million reduction to expense related
to a change in our vacation policy for non-union employees.
Operating profit in 2002 benefited, compared with 2001, from a
$61 million reduction in goodwill expense as a result of
the elimination of goodwill amortization. Non-package operating
profit includes $112 million in 2002 (compared to
$113 million in 2001) of intersegment profit, with a
corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces
operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment.

Operating Expenses and Operating
    Margin

2003 compared to 2002

Consolidated operating expenses increased by
$1.864 billion, or 6.9%, for the year, $398 million of
which was due to currency fluctuations in our international
package and non-package segments. Compensation and



benefits increased by $1.388 billion, or
7.7%, for the year, primarily due to increased health and
welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense. Stock-based
compensation expense totaled $724 million in 2003, a 14.0%
increase over 2002, primarily as a result of increased
management incentive awards expense and adopting the measurement
provisions of FAS 123 for 2003 stock-based compensation
awards.

Other operating expenses increased by
$476 million, or 5.2%, for the year, largely due to a 12.3%
increase in occupancy costs, a 10.3% increase in fuel expense,
and smaller increases in purchased transportation, repairs and
maintenance, and depreciation and amortization. Other operating
expenses in 2002 were affected by the $106 million
restructuring charge and related expenses incurred in the
integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group
operations into our UPS Supply Chain Solutions unit. The growth
in other occupancy expense was impacted by higher rent expense
on buildings and facilities, higher real estate taxes, and
weather-related increases in natural gas and utilities expense.
The fuel expense increase was due to higher fuel prices in 2003,
somewhat offset by hedging gains and lower fuel usage. The
increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by
the impact of currency and growth in our international package
and Supply Chain Solutions businesses. The growth in
depreciation and amortization reflects the addition of new
aircraft, the completion of facilities projects (including UPS
Worldport), and increased amortization of capitalized software.
The increase in repairs and maintenance was primarily due to
higher vehicle, aircraft, and equipment maintenance expense.

The increase in other expenses was due to a
$75 million impairment charge recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2003, resulting from an impairment evaluation
performed when we permanently removed a number of
Boeing 727 and DC-8 aircraft from service. Of the total
$75 million impairment charge, $69 million impacted
the U.S. domestic package segment and $6 million
impacted the international package segment.

Our operating margin, defined as operating profit
as a percentage of revenue, increased to 13.3% in 2003 from
13.1% in 2002. This increase is due to the growth in operating
margin in our international package and non-package segments,
which benefited from the revenue increases described previously.
The operating margin for our three business segments was as
follows:

2002 adjusted operating margins exclude the
effects of the vacation change, which increased operating profit
(U.S. domestic — $175 million, 0.7% effect
on operating margin; international package —
$11 million, 0.3%; and non-package —
$11 million, 0.4%), and the effects of the restructuring
charge, which reduced non-package operating profit by
$106 million and operating margin by 4.0%.

2002 compared to 2001

Consolidated operating expenses increased by
$817 million, or 3.1%, for the year ended December 31,
2002. Compensation and benefits increased $543 million, or
3.1%, due primarily to increased costs associated with health
and retirement benefits. In 2002, compensation and benefits were
reduced by the $197 million credit to expense related to
the change in our vacation policy for non-union employees.

Other operating expenses increased by
$274 million, or 3.1%, for the year. In 2002, other
operating expenses were affected by the $106 million
restructuring charge and related expenses. In 2002, depreciation
and amortization benefited from the absence of $72 million
of expense related to the elimination of goodwill amortization.
In 2001, other operating expenses were reduced by
$74 million for compensation under the Air Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act.

The non-package segment accounted for
$513 million of the $817 million total increase in
operating expenses. This was principally due to acquisitions
that we completed during the first nine months of 2001. Our



consolidated operating margin, defined as
operating profit as a percentage of revenue, remained at 13.1%
during 2001 and 2002.

Investment Income/ Interest
    Expense

2003 compared to 2002

The decrease in investment income of
$45 million in 2003 is primarily due to a $58 million
impairment charge recognized during the first quarter of 2003.
We periodically review our investments for indications of other
than temporary impairment considering many factors, including
the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value
has been less than its cost, overall economic and market
conditions, and the financial condition and specific prospects
for the issuer. During the first quarter of 2003, after
considering the continued decline in the U.S. equity
markets, we recognized an impairment charge of $58 million,
primarily related to our investment in S&P 500 equity
portfolios.

The $52 million decline in interest expense
in 2003 was primarily the result of lower commercial paper
balances outstanding, lower interest rates on variable rate
debt, and lower floating rates on interest rate swaps.

2002 compared to 2001

The decrease in investment income of
$96 million for 2002 is primarily due to a combination of
lower interest rates and lower balances available for investment
in 2002.

Net Income and Earnings Per
    Share

2003 compared to 2002

Net income for 2003 was $2.898 billion, a
decrease of $284 million from the $3.182 billion
achieved in 2002, resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings
per share from $2.81 in 2002 to $2.55 in 2003. Net income in
2002 was favorably impacted by $776 million after-tax
($0.68 per diluted share) resulting from the reversal of a
portion of the previously established tax assessment liability,
and by $121 million after-tax ($0.11 per diluted
share) from the credit to expense as a result of the change in
our vacation policy for non-union employees. Net income in 2002
was adversely impacted by $65 million after-tax
($0.06 per diluted share) due to the restructuring charge
and related expenses and by $72 million after-tax
($0.06 per diluted share) due to the FAS 142
cumulative expense adjustment. Excluding the effect of the
preceeding items, net income for 2002 would have been
$2.422 billion, or $2.14 per diluted share.

Net income in 2003 benefited from the
$14 million after-tax gain ($0.01 per diluted share)
on the sale of our Mail Technologies unit in the second quarter
of 2003, the $15 million after-tax gain ($0.01 per
diluted share) on the sale of our Aviation Technologies unit in
the third quarter of 2003, and the $18 million after-tax
gain ($0.02 per diluted share) due to the redemption of our
$300 million cash-settled convertible senior notes. In
addition, 2003 income tax expense was reduced by
$55 million ($0.05 per diluted share) due to the
resolution of various tax issues with the Internal Revenue
Service during the first quarter, by $22 million
($0.02 per diluted share) due to a tax contingency accrual
adjustment resulting from a favorable ruling on the tax
treatment for jet engine maintenance costs during the third
quarter, and by $39 million ($0.03 per share) due to a
lower effective state tax rate in the fourth quarter. Net income
in 2003 was adversely affected by the $37 million after-tax
($0.03 per diluted share) investment impairment charge
described previously. Excluding the effect of the preceeding
items, net income for 2003 would have been $2.772 billion,
or $2.44 per diluted share. This would represent a 14.0%
increase in diluted earnings per share over the $2.14 achieved
in 2002 (after taking into account the items discussed
previously).

2002 compared to 2001

Net income for 2002 was $3.182 billion, an
increase of $783 million from $2.399 billion in 2001,
resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.81
in 2002 from $2.10 in 2001. Net income in 2001 was adversely
impacted by the FAS 133 cumulative expense adjustment of
$26 million after-tax ($0.02 per diluted share),
without which net income would have been $2.425 billion, or
$2.12 per diluted share. In 2002, our



results were affected by the fourth quarter
restructuring charge and related expenses of $65 million
after-tax ($0.06 per diluted share), the FAS 142
cumulative expense adjustment of $72 million after-tax
($0.06 per diluted share), the credit to compensation and
benefits resulting from the change in our vacation policy for
non-union employees of $121 million after-tax
($0.11 per diluted share), and the credit related to the
reversal of a portion of the previously established tax
assessment liability of $776 million after-tax
($0.68 per diluted share). Excluding the effect of the
preceeding items, net income for 2002 would have been
$2.422 billion, or $2.14 per diluted share.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net Cash From Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was
$4.646, $5.688 and $4.570 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The decrease in 2003 operating cash flows from
2002 was primarily the result of the funding of
$1.1 billion into our pension plans during 2003. As
discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements, projected pension contributions in 2004 are
approximately $426 million.

In November 2003, we announced rate increases,
which took effect on January 5, 2004. The overall impact is
in line with previous years’ rate increases. We increased
rates for standard ground shipments an average of 1.9% for
commercial deliveries. The ground residential surcharge
increased $0.25 to $1.40 over the commercial ground rate. An
additional delivery area surcharge of $1.00 was implemented for
commercial deliveries in certain ZIP codes. Rates for UPS
Hundredweight increased 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates
for UPS Next Day Air an average of 2.9% and increased rates for
deferred services by 2.9%. Rates for international shipments
originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide
Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International
Standard service) increased an average of 3.5%. Rate changes for
shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout
the past year and varied by geographic market.

In addition, we discontinued the fuel surcharge
on ground service, while a new index is being applied to our
Next Day Air, deferred products, and international services.
This new fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based
on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price
for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. The index for shipments
originating in Europe will be based on the Rotterdam ARA spot
price of kerosene-type jet fuel.

Net Cash Used In Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.942,
$2.194 and $3.053 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The primary reason for these declines has been the
slowing growth of our finance receivables portfolio, and the
lack of business acquisitions during 2002 and 2003. Capital
expenditures represent the primary use of cash in investing
activities, as follows (in millions):

We anticipate capital expenditures of
approximately $2.2 billion in 2004. These expenditures will
provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated
future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized
software. We fund our capital expenditures with our cash from
operations.



Net Cash Used In Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $2.180,
$2.090 and $1.493 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Our primary use of cash in financing activities
has been to repay long-term debt, repurchase stock, and pay
dividends. During 2003, we repaid over $1.2 billion in
debt, primarily consisting of $492 million of commercial
paper, $300 million in cash-convertible notes, and
$411 million in repayments of UPS Notes. Issuances of debt
primarily consisted of UPS Notes. We consider the overall fixed
and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related
overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and
non-scheduled repayments of debt.

In August 2003, a total of $1.0 billion was
authorized for share repurchases as part of our continuing share
repurchase program. As of December 31, 2003,
$858 million of this authorization was available for future
share repurchases. We repurchased a total of $398 million
of common stock in 2003.

We increased our cash dividends per share to
$0.92 in 2003 from $0.76 in 2002, resulting in an increase in
total cash dividends paid to $1.026 billion from
$840 million. The declaration of dividends is subject to
the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on
various factors, including our net income, financial condition,
cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors.
We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash
dividends. In February 2004, the Board of Directors declared a
$0.28 per share dividend, which represents a 12% increase
over the $0.25 previous quarterly dividend. The dividend is
payable on March 9, 2004 to shareowners of record on
February 23, 2004.

Sources of Credit

We maintain two commercial paper programs under
which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion.
Approximately $544 million was outstanding under these
programs as of December 31, 2003, with an average interest
rate of 0.96%. The entire balance outstanding has been
classified as a current liability on our balance sheet. In
addition, we maintain an extendible commercial notes program
under which we are authorized to borrow up to $500 million.
No amounts were outstanding under this program at
December 31, 2003.

We maintain two credit agreements with a
consortium of banks. These agreements provide revolving credit
facilities of $1.0 billion each, with one expiring on
April 22, 2004 and the other on April 24, 2008.
Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would
be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were
no borrowings under either of these agreements as of
December 31, 2003.

We also maintain a $1.0 billion European
medium-term note program. Under this program, we may issue notes
from time to time, denominated in a variety of currencies. No
amounts were outstanding under this program at December 31,
2003.

In August 2003, we filed a $2.0 billion
shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt
securities in the United States. There was approximately
$85 million issued under this shelf registration statement
at December 31, 2003, all of which consists of issuances
under our UPS Notes program.

Commitments

We have contractual obligations and commitments
in the form of operating leases, capital leases, debt
obligations, and purchase commitments. We intend to satisfy
these obligations through the use of cash flow



from operations. The following table summarizes
our contractual obligations and commitments as of
December 31, 2003 (in millions):

We believe that funds from operations and
borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity
and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for
the operation of our business, including anticipated capital
expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases, through
2009.

Contingencies

On August 9, 1999 the United States Tax
Court Tax Court held that we were liable for tax on income of
Overseas Partners Ltd., a Bermuda company that had reinsured EV
insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that
we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax
years. The IRS took similar positions to those advanced in the
Tax Court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984 through
1998. On June 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the Tax Court
decision. In January 2003, we and the IRS finalized settlement
of all outstanding tax issues related to EV package insurance.
Under the terms of settlement, we agreed to adjustments that
will result in income tax due of approximately
$562 million, additions to tax of $60 million and
related interest. The amount due to the IRS as a result of the
settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued. As a
result, we recorded income, before taxes, of $1.023 billion
($776 million after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2002.
The refunds and credits associated with this settlement are
expected to occur over the next several years.

The IRS has proposed adjustments, unrelated to
the EV package insurance matters discussed above, regarding the
allowance of deductions and certain losses, the characterization
of expenses as capital rather than ordinary, the treatment of
certain income, and our entitlement to the investment tax credit
and the research tax credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years.
The proposed adjustments would result in $10 million of
additional income tax. The IRS has also issued a report taking a
similar position with respect to some of these issues for each
of the years from 1991 through 1994. That report proposes
adjustments that would result in $42 million in additional
income tax. The IRS’s proposed adjustments include
penalties and penalty interest. We believe that the possibility
that such penalties and penalty interest will be sustained is
remote. In November 2002, the IRS issued a report taking a
similar position with respect to some of these issues for each
of the years 1995 through 1998. That report proposes adjustments
that would result in $7 million in additional income tax.
For the 1985 through 1998 tax years, unpaid interest on these
adjustments through December 31, 2003 could aggregate up to
approximately $178 million, after the benefit of related
tax deductions. We expect that we will prevail on substantially
all of these issues. Specifically, we believe that our practice
of expensing the items that the IRS alleges should have been
capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry
participants. The IRS may take similar positions with respect to
some of these issues for each of the years 1999 through 2003. We
believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity.

We are named as a defendant in twenty-three
pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection
of premiums for excess value (“EV”) insurance in
connection with package shipments since 1984. Based on state and
federal tort, contract and statutory claims, these cases
generally claim that we failed to remit collected EV premiums to
an independent insurer; we failed to provide promised EV
insurance; we acted



as an insurer without complying with state
insurance laws and regulations; and the price for EV insurance
was excessive.

These actions all were filed after the
August 9, 1999 United States Tax Court decision, in which
the Tax Court held that we were liable for tax on income of
Overseas Partners Ltd., a Bermuda company that had reinsured EV
insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that
we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax
years. On June 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Eleventh Circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the Tax
Court decision. In January 2003, we and the IRS finalized
settlement of all outstanding tax issues relating to EV package
insurance.

These twenty-three cases have been consolidated
for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation proceeding
(“MDL Proceeding”) in federal court in New York.
In addition to the cases in which UPS is named as a defendant,
there also is an action, Smith v. Mail Boxes Etc., against
Mail Boxes Etc. and its franchisees relating to UPS EV insurance
and related services purchased through Mail Boxes Etc. centers.
This case also has been consolidated into the MDL Proceeding.

While expressly denying any and all liability,
the parties have obtained preliminary court approval of a global
settlement resolving all claims and all cases in the MDL
Proceeding. The proposed settlement requires several steps
before it becomes final, including notice to the settlement
class, and obtaining final court approval. If the proposed
settlement becomes final, we would provide to qualifying
settlement class members vouchers toward the purchase of
specified UPS services and pay a portion of the plaintiffs’
attorneys’ fees, the total amount of which will be
determined by the Court. The ultimate cost to us of the proposed
settlement will depend on a number of factors. We do not believe
that this proposed settlement will have a material effect on our
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

In addition, we are a defendant in various other
lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe
that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations, or liquidity.

We participate in a number of trustee-managed
multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for
employees covered under collective bargaining agreements.
Several factors could result in higher future contributions to
these plans, including unfavorable investment performance,
changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants.
At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of
additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flows could result from our participation in
these plans.

Due to the events of September 11, 2001,
increased security requirements for air carriers may be
forthcoming; however, we do not anticipate that such measures
will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity. In addition, our insurance
premiums have risen and we have taken several actions, including
self-insuring certain risks, to mitigate the expense increase.

As of December 31, 2003, we had
approximately 228,000 employees (64% of our total employees)
employed under a national master agreement and various
supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”).
These agreements run through July 31, 2008. The majority of
our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement
with the Independent Pilots Association, which became amendable
January 1, 2004. Negotiations are ongoing with the
assistance of the National Mediation Board. Our airline
mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with
Teamsters Local 2727, which becomes amendable on
November 1, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground
mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the
Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements
with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009.

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in
certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates,
interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks
arise in the normal course of business, as we do



not engage in speculative trading activities. In
order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we
utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and
commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps.

The following analysis provides quantitative
information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk,
foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity
price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the
sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with
exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel
shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and
commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with
non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are
utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are
certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses
presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates
change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change
instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect
the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the
market shifts modeled.

A discussion of our accounting policies for
derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in
Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to an increase in the prices of
refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline,
which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally,
we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy
products, primarily natural gas and electricity, used in our
operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination
of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some
protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative
instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy
consumption for periods up to one year. The net fair value of
such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying
exposures, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was an asset
(liability) of $30 and $34 million, respectively. The
potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts,
assuming a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying commodity
price, would be approximately $17 and $38 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This amount
excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the
physical purchase of the underlying commodities.

Foreign Currency Exchange
    Risk

We have foreign currency risks related to our
revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in
currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate.
We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in
functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated
assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant
foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro and the British
Pound Sterling. We use a combination of purchased and written
options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency
exposures. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the net fair
value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset
(liability) of $(48) and $(3) million, respectively. The
potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a
hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency
exchange rates would be approximately $97 and $42 million
at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This
sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign
currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same
direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a
parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange
rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign
currency.

Interest Rate Risk

As described in Note 8 to the consolidated
financial statements, we have various debt instruments,
including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue
expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a
combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate
swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our
program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of
our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing.
These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the
issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the
notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the
swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Our floating rate
debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from
changes in short-term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The
potential change in annual



interest expense resulting from a hypothetical
100 basis point change in short-term interest rates applied to
our floating rate debt and swap instruments at December 31,
2003 and 2002 would be approximately $25 and $28 million,
respectively.

As described in Note 1 and Note 2 to
the consolidated financial statements, we have certain
investments in debt auction rate, and preferred securities that
accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential
change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical
100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our
investments exposed to variable interest rates at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 would be approximately $31 and
$19 million, respectively.

Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the
consolidated financial statements, we hold a portfolio of
finance receivables, that accrue income at fixed and floating
rates of interest. The potential change in annual income
resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest
rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 would be immaterial.

This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes
interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the
yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely
instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of
the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these
estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed
and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive
assets and liabilities in response to changes in market
conditions.

Equity Price Risk

We hold investments in various common equity
securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of
these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk.
At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair value of such
investments was $95 and $322 million, respectively. The
potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming
a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of
any hedges, would be approximately $10 million at both
December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Credit Risk

The forward contracts, swaps, and options
previously discussed contain an element of risk that the
counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the
agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these
instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and
financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines.
We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty
default.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement
No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities” (“FAS 146”).
FAS 146 provides guidance on the recognition and
measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal
activities and requires that such liabilities be recognized when
incurred. This statement was effective for exit or disposal
activities initiated on or after January 1, 2003.

As discussed in Note 17, we implemented a
restructuring program involving the business unit integration of
our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations in the
fourth quarter of 2002. As this restructuring program was
initiated in 2002, we accounted for this restructuring program
using the existing guidance in EITF 94-3 “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)”. Therefore, the adoption of FAS 146 on
January 1, 2003 had no effect on our results of operations
or financial condition. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we
recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge and related expenses in
the amount of $106 million, which is classified in other
operating expenses.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”).
FIN 45 requires that a liability be recognized at fair
value at the inception of certain guarantees for the obligations
undertaken by the guarantor. FIN 45 also requires
additional disclosures for certain guarantee contracts. The
disclosure provisions of FIN 45 were effective for
financial statements ending after Decem-



ber 15, 2002, while the recognition and
initial measurement provisions were applicable on a prospective
basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002. The adoption of FIN 45 was not material to our
results of operations or financial condition.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities”, to address perceived weaknesses in accounting
for entities commonly known as special purpose or off balance
sheet. In addition to numerous FASB Staff Positions written to
clarify and improve the application of FIN 46, the FASB
recently announced a deferral for certain entities, and an
amendment to FIN 46 entitled FASB Interpretation
No. 46 (revised December 2003) “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”).

FIN 46 provides guidance for identifying the
party with a controlling financial interest resulting from
arrangements or financial instruments rather than voting
interests. FIN 46 defines the term “variable interest
entity” and is based on the premise that if a business
enterprise absorbs a majority of such an entity’s expected
losses and/or receives a majority of its expected residual
returns, that enterprise has a controlling financial interest,
and would thus require consolidation of the variable interest
entity. As of December 31, 2003, we have adopted
FIN 46, and the effects of adoption were not material to
our results of operations or financial condition.

On July 1, 2003, we adopted FASB Statement
No. 149 “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“FAS 149”). FAS 149 amends FAS 133 for
certain decisions made by the FASB as part of the Derivatives
Implementation Group process. FAS 149 also amends
FAS 133 to incorporate clarifications of the definition of
a derivative. The adoption of FAS 149 was not material to
our results of operations or financial condition.

On July 1, 2003, we adopted FASB Statement
No. 150 “Accounting for Certain Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity”
(“FAS 150”). FAS 150 establishes how an
issuer measures certain freestanding financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity, and requires
that such instruments be classified as liabilities. The adoption
of FAS 150 was not material to our results of operations or
financial condition.

In December 2003, the FASB revised Statement
No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits” (FAS 132). The
revised standard requires new disclosures in addition to those
required by the original standard about the assets, obligations,
cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit
pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. As
revised, FAS 132 is effective for financial statements with
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, and we have
included these disclosures in Note 5 to our consolidated
financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based on our
consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in our financial
statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are
necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting
principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other
assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances.
Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would
affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements.
While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many
reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may
involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.

Contingencies

—
As discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial
statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and
contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”
(“FAS 5”). FAS 5 requires a liability to be
recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the
resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these
contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is
settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge
to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled
for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to
income would result.



Goodwill
Impairment

— The Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
(“FAS 142”) in June 2001. As a result of the
issuance of this new standard, goodwill is no longer amortized,
but is subjected to annual impairment testing. Goodwill
impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of
our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill
recorded on our balance sheet. The estimation of fair value
requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and
appropriate discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of
goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors,
including the actual operating performance of the underlying
reporting units. Upon adoption of FAS 142, we recorded a
non-cash impairment charge of $72 million ($0.06 per
diluted share), as of January 1, 2002, related to our Mail
Technologies business. The primary factor resulting in the
impairment charge was the lower than anticipated growth
experienced in the expedited mail delivery business. In
conjunction with our annual test of goodwill in 2002, we
recorded an additional impairment charge of $2 million
related to our Mail Technologies business, resulting in total
goodwill impairment of $74 million for 2002. Our annual
impairment test performed in 2003 resulted in no goodwill
impairment. As of December 31, 2003, our recorded goodwill
was $1.173 billion.

Self-Insurance
Accruals

— We self-insure
costs associated with workers’ compensation claims,
automotive liability, and general business liabilities, up to
certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates
of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as
well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet
reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels
determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss
experience and judgments about the present and expected levels
of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant
factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our
estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual
experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially
differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations.

Pension and Postretirement Medical
Benefits

— The
Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit costs
are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and
methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” These
assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend
rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected
return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors.
Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated
and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally
affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such
future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in
recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based
on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and
information as to historical experience and performance.
Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may
affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and
future expense. The impact of decreasing the weighted-average
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to 8.96% and
the decrease in the discount rate to 6.25%, combined with other
factors such as the additional fundings which occurred during
2003, will increase our pension plan expense by approximately
$18 million in 2004.

Financial
Instruments

— As discussed
in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 16 to our consolidated financial
statements, and in the “Market Risk” section of this
report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain
elements of market risk. Certain of these financial instruments
are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based
on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the
extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value
is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer
price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including
over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using
pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual
and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads and
yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income,
equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our
estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our
results of operations.

Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment
of Fixed Assets

— As of
December 31, 2003, we had approximately $13.9 billion
of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is
aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates
about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values
of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the
fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these
assets.



In estimating the lives and expected residual
values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with
the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to
these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance
program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft,
governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market
prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We
periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and
adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments
to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a
prospective basis through depreciation expense.

When appropriate, we evaluate our fixed assets
for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment
may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the
extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in
the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses
associated with the use of the asset.

In December 2003, we permanently removed from
service a number of Boeing 727 and DC-8 aircraft. As a result,
we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a
$75 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for
these aircraft. This charge is classified in the caption
“other expenses” within other operating expenses (see
Note 13). UPS continues to operate all of its other
aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow.

Forward-Looking Statements

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” and other parts of
this report contain ”forward-looking” statements about
matters that inherently are difficult to predict. These
statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and
current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects
and future results. We have described some of the important
factors that affect these statements as we discussed each
subject. Forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
statements.

Risk Factors

The following are some of the factors that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected
results described in our forward-looking statements:



quantities of gasoline and fuel and are exposed
    to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the
    market price for petroleum products.

•

Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our
    operating results due to decreased demand for our services.

Controls
and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this
report, management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
Based upon, and as of the date of that evaluation, our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the
disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all
material respects, to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when
required.

There have been no significant changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially effect, our internal controls
over financial reporting. There were no significant deficiencies
or material weaknesses identified in the evaluation and
therefore, no corrective actions were taken.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareowners

United Parcel Service, Inc.

Atlanta, Georgia

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of United Parcel Service, Inc. and its
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareowners’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of United Parcel Service, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” effective
January 1, 2001; Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” effective January 1, 2002; and began applying
prospectively the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” effective January 1, 2003.

Note 1.     Summary
of Accounting Policies

Basis of
Financial Statements and Business Activities

The accompanying financial statements include the
accounts of United Parcel Service, Inc., and all of its
consolidated subsidiaries (collectively “UPS” or the
“Company”). All intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated.

UPS concentrates its operations in the field of
transportation services, primarily domestic and international
letter and package delivery. Through our non-package
subsidiaries, we are also a global provider of specialized
transportation, logistics, and financial services.

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

U.S. Domestic and International Package
Operations —

Revenue is
recognized upon delivery of a letter or package.

UPS Supply Chain
Solutions

— Freight
forwarding revenue is recognized net of the expense related to
the transportation of freight at the time the services are
performed. Material management and distribution revenue is
recognized upon performance of the service provided. Customs
brokerage revenue is recognized upon completing documents
necessary for customs entry purposes.

UPS
Capital

— Income on loans
and direct finance leases is recognized on the interest method.
Accrual of interest income is suspended at the earlier of the
time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the
account becomes 90 days delinquent. Income on operating
leases is recognized on the straight-line method over the terms
of the underlying leases.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid investments (including investments in debt, auction rate
securities, and other money market instruments of $2.493 and
$1.780 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively) that are readily convertible into cash. We
consider securities with maturities of three months or less,
when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of
these securities approximates fair value because of the
short-term maturity of these instruments.

Marketable
Securities and Short-Term Investments

Marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with related
unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as other
comprehensive income (“OCI”), a separate component of
shareowners’ equity. The amortized cost of debt securities
is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion is
included in investment income, along with interest and
dividends. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method; realized gains and losses resulting from
such sales are included in investment income.

Investment securities are reviewed for impairment
in accordance with FASB Statement No. 115 “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”.
Impairment of investment securities results in a charge to
income when a market decline below cost is other than temporary.

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are carried at
cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided by the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which are as follows: Vehicles — 9 years;
Aircraft — 12 to 20 years; Buildings —
20 to 40 years; Leasehold Improvements — lives of
leases; Plant Equipment — 5 to 8 1/3 years;
Technology Equipment (including capitalized
software) — 3 to 5 years. The costs of major
airframe and engine overhauls, as well as routine maintenance
and repairs, are charged to expense as incurred.

Interest incurred during the construction period
of certain property, plant and equipment is capitalized until
the underlying assets are placed in service, at which time
amortization of the capitalized interest begins, straight-line,
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Capitalized interest was $25, $25, and $47 million for
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 144”), we
review long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable
based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the
carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be
recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values
are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash
flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. We review
long-lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the
asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash
flows can be identified.

In December 2003, we permanently removed from
service a number of Boeing 727 and DC-8 aircraft. As a result,
we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a
$75 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for
these aircraft, $69 million of which impacted the U.S.
domestic package segment and $6 million of which impacted
the international package segment. This charge is classified in
the caption “other expenses” within other operating
expenses (see Note 13). UPS continues to operate all of its
other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow.

Goodwill and
Intangible Assets

Costs of purchased businesses in excess of net
assets acquired (goodwill), and intangible assets are accounted
for under the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS
142”). The amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangibles ceased upon the implementation of FAS 142 on
January 1, 2002. Had the non-amortization provisions of FAS
142 been applied to 2001, then our net income would have been
increased by $59 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in
that year.

Also upon adoption of FAS 142, we were required
to test all existing goodwill for impairment as of that date,
and at least annually thereafter, unless changes in
circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred sooner.
We are required to test goodwill on a “reporting unit”
basis. A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, for
businesses within that operating segment, discrete financial
information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management, in
which case such a component business is the reporting unit.

A fair value approach is used to test goodwill
for impairment. An impairment charge is recognized for the
amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds
its fair value. Fair values are established using discounted
cash flows. When available and as appropriate, comparative
market multiples were used to corroborate discounted cash flow
results.

We recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge
of $72 million ($0.06 per diluted share), as of
January 1, 2002, related to our Mail Technologies business.
This charge is reported as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle and resulted in a restatement of our first
quarter 2002 quarterly financial

F-9


UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

statements (see Note 19). The primary factor
resulting in the impairment charge was the lower than
anticipated growth experienced in the expedited mail delivery
business. In conjunction with our annual test of goodwill in
2002, we recorded an additional impairment charge of
$2 million related to our Mail Technologies business,
resulting in total goodwill impairment of $74 million for
2002. We sold the Mail Technologies business unit during the
second quarter of 2003 (see Note 7). Our annual impairment
test performed in 2003 resulted in no goodwill impairment.

Self-Insurance
Accruals

We self-insure costs associated with
workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability, and
general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance
reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will
ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of
claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded
balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside
actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and
judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per
claim.

Income
Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under FASB
Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
(“’FAS 109”). FAS 109 is an asset and liability
approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in our financial statements or
tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, FAS 109
generally considers all expected future events other than
proposed changes in the tax law or rates. Valuation allowances
are provided if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax
asset will not be realized.

Foreign
Currency Translation

We translate the results of operations of our
foreign subsidiaries using average exchange rates during each
period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using
exchange rates at the end of each period. Balance sheet currency
translation adjustments are recorded in OCI. Net currency
transaction gains and losses included in other operating
expenses were pre-tax gains of $21, $27 and $16 million in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the
fair value measurement provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123 “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” (“FAS 123”). In
years prior to 2003, we used the intrinsic value method
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB
25”). Under APB 25, we did not have to recognize
compensation expense for our stock option grants and our
discounted stock purchase plan, however we did recognize
compensation expense for our management incentive awards and
certain other stock awards (see Note 11 for a description
of these plans).

Under the provisions of FASB Statement
No. 148 “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure,” we
have elected to adopt the measurement provisions of FAS 123
using the prospective method. Under this approach, all
stock-based compensation granted subsequent to January 1,
2003 has been expensed to compensation and benefits over the
vesting period based on the fair value at the date the
stock-based compensation is granted. Stock compensation awards
granted in 2003 include stock options, management incentive
awards, restricted performance units, and employer matching
contributions (in shares of UPS stock) for a defined
contribution benefit plan. The adoption of the measurement
provisions of FAS 123 reduced 2003 net income by
$20 million, or $0.02 per diluted share.

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following provides pro forma information as
to the impact on net income and earnings per share if we had
used the fair value measurement provisions of FAS 123 to account
for all stock-based compensation awards granted prior to
January 1, 2003 (in millions, except per share amounts).

The fair value of each option grant is estimated
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation cost
is also measured for the fair value of employees’ purchase
rights under our discounted stock purchase plan using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average
assumptions used, by year, and the calculated weighted average
fair value of options and employees’ purchase rights
granted, are as follows:

*

Includes the 10% discount from the market price
    (see Note 11).

Derivative Instruments

Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted FASB
Statement No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS 133”),
as amended by Statements No. 137 and No. 138. FAS 133,
as amended, requires all financial derivative instruments to be
recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives not
designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through
income. If a derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on
the nature of the hedge, changes in its fair value that are
considered to be effective, as defined, either offset the change
in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm
commitments

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

through income, or are recorded in OCI until the
hedged item is recorded in income. Any portion of a change in a
derivative’s fair value that is considered to be
ineffective, or is excluded from the measurement of
effectiveness, is recorded immediately in income.

At January 1, 2001, our financial statements
were adjusted to record a cumulative effect of adopting
FAS 133, as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

(a)

For income effect, amount shown is net of
    adjustment to hedged items.

The cumulative effect on income resulted
primarily from marking to market the time value of option
contracts used in commodity and foreign currency cash flow
hedging. The cumulative effect on OCI resulted primarily from
marking to market swap contracts used as cash flow hedges of
anticipated foreign currency cash flows and anticipated
purchases of energy products.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement
No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities” (“FAS 146”).
FAS 146 provides guidance on the recognition and
measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal
activities and requires that such liabilities be recognized when
incurred. This statement was effective for exit or disposal
activities initiated on or after January 1, 2003.

As discussed in Note 17, we implemented a
restructuring program involving the business unit integration of
our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations in the
fourth quarter of 2002. As this restructuring program was
initiated in 2002, we accounted for this restructuring program
using the existing guidance in EITF 94-3 “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)”. Therefore, the adoption of FAS 146 on
January 1, 2003 had no effect on our results of operations
or financial condition. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we
recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge and related expenses in
the amount of $106 million, which is classified in other
operating expenses.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”).
FIN 45 requires that a liability be recognized at fair
value at the inception of certain guarantees for the obligations
undertaken by the guarantor. FIN 45 also requires
additional disclosures for certain guarantee contracts. The
disclosure provisions of FIN 45 were effective for
financial statements ending after December 15, 2002, while
the recognition and initial measurement provisions were
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of
FIN 45 was not material to our results of operations or
financial condition.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities”, to address perceived weaknesses in accounting
for entities commonly known as special purpose or off balance
sheet. In addition to numerous FASB Staff Positions written to
clarify and improve the application of FIN 46, the FASB
recently announced a deferral for certain entities, and an
amendment to FIN 46 entitled FASB Interpretation
No. 46 (revised December 2003) “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”).

F-12


UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

FIN 46 provides guidance for identifying the
party with a controlling financial interest resulting from
arrangements or financial instruments rather than voting
interests. FIN 46 defines the term “variable interest
entity” and is based on the premise that if a business
enterprise absorbs a majority of such an entity’s expected
losses and/or receives a majority of its expected residual
returns, that enterprise has a controlling financial interest,
and would thus require consolidation of the variable interest
entity. As of December 31, 2003, we have adopted FIN 46,
and the effects of adoption were not material to our results of
operations or financial condition.

On July 1, 2003, we adopted FASB Statement
No. 149 “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“FAS 149”). FAS 149 amends FAS 133 for
certain decisions made by the FASB as part of the Derivatives
Implementation Group process. FAS 149 also amends
FAS 133 to incorporate clarifications of the definition of
a derivative. The adoption of FAS 149 was not material to
our results of operations or financial condition.

On July 1, 2003, we adopted FASB Statement
No. 150 “Accounting for Certain Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity”
(“FAS 150”). FAS 150 establishes how an
issuer measures certain freestanding financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity, and requires
that such instruments be classified as liabilities. The adoption
of FAS 150 was not material to our results of operations or
financial condition.

In December 2003, the FASB revised Statement
No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits” (FAS 132). The
revised standard requires new disclosures in addition to those
required by the original standard about the assets, obligations,
cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit
pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. As
revised, FAS 132 is effective for financial statements with
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, and we have
included these disclosures in Note 5 — Employee
Benefit Plans.

Changes in Presentation

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the current year presentation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The gross realized gains on sales of marketable
securities totaled $21, $11, and $34 million in 2003, 2002,
and 2001, respectively. The gross realized losses totaled $7,
$10, and $7 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.
Impairment losses recognized on marketable securities and
short-term investments totaled $58, $5, and $0 million
during 2003, 2002, and 2001 respectively.

The following table presents the age of gross
unrealized losses and fair value by investment category for all
securities in a loss position as of December 31, 2003 (in
millions):

The unrealized losses in the preferred equity
securities relate to securities issued by the Federal National
Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC), and are primarily due to changes in market
interest rates. Due to the periodic interest rate adjustment
features on these securities, we do not consider these losses to
be other-than-temporary. We have both the intent and ability to
hold the securities contained in the previous table for a time
necessary to recover the cost basis.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of
marketable securities and short-term investments at
December 31, 2003, by contractual maturity, are shown below
(in millions). Actual maturities may differ from contractual
maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the

Receivables

The following is a summary of finance receivables
at December 31, 2003 and 2002 (in millions):

Outstanding receivable balances at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 are net of unearned income of
$48 and $35 million, respectively. When we
“factor” (i.e., purchase) a customer invoice from a
client, we record the customer receivable as an asset and also
establish a liability for the funds due to the client, which is
recorded in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet.
The following is a reconciliation of receivable factoring
balances at December 31, 2003 and 2002 (in millions):

Non-earning finance receivables were $67 and
$41 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The following is a rollforward of the allowance
for credit losses on finance receivables (in millions):

The carrying value of finance receivables at
December 31, 2003, by contractual maturity, is shown below
(in millions). Actual maturities may differ from contractual
maturities because some borrowers have the right to prepay these
receivables without prepayment penalties.

Based on interest rates for financial instruments
with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of finance
receivables is approximately $1.384 and $1.492 billion as
of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At
December 31, 2003, we had unfunded loan commitments
totaling $493 million, consisting of standby letters of
credit of $68 million and other unfunded lending
commitments of $425 million.

Note 5.     Employee
Benefit Plans

We maintain the following defined benefit pension
plans (the “Plans”): UPS Retirement Plan,
UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan, and the
UPS Pension Plan.

The UPS Retirement Plan is noncontributory and
includes substantially all eligible employees of participating
domestic subsidiaries who are not members of a collective
bargaining unit. The Plan provides for retirement benefits based
on average compensation levels earned by employees prior to
retirement. Benefits payable under this Plan are subject to
maximum compensation limits and the annual benefit limits for a
tax qualified defined benefit plan as prescribed by the Internal
Revenue Service.

The UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is
a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to participants in
the UPS Retirement Plan for amounts that exceed the benefit
limits described above.

F-16


UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The UPS Pension Plan is noncontributory and
includes certain eligible employees of participating domestic
subsidiaries and members of collective bargaining units that
elect to participate in the plan. The Plan provides for
retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees
prior to retirement.

Our funding policy is consistent with relevant
federal tax regulations. Accordingly, our contributions are
deductible for federal income tax purposes. Because the UPS
Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is non-qualified for federal
income tax purposes, this plan is not funded.

We also sponsor postretirement medical plans that
provide health care benefits to our retirees who meet certain
eligibility requirements and who are not otherwise covered by
multi-employer plans. Generally, this includes employees with at
least 10 years of service who have reached age 55 and
employees who are eligible for postretirement medical benefits
from a Company-sponsored plan pursuant to collective bargaining
agreements. We have the right to modify or terminate certain of
these plans. In many cases, these benefits have been provided to
retirees on a noncontributory basis; however, in certain cases,
retirees are required to contribute toward the cost of the
coverage.

Our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
and net periodic cost for our postretirement medical benefits do
not reflect the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”).
The provisions of the Act provide for a federal subsidy for
plans that provide prescription drug benefits and meet certain
qualifications. Specific authoritative guidance on the
accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and when that
guidance is issued, it could require us to change information
related to our actuarially determined accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation and net periodic cost for our postretirement
medical benefit plans.

Benefit Obligations

The following table provides a reconciliation of
the changes in the plans’ benefit obligations as of
September 30 (in millions):

The accumulated benefit obligation for our
pension plans as of September 30, 2003 and 2002 was $7.325
and $5.977 billion, respectively. We use a measurement date
of September 30 for our pension and postretirement benefit
plans.

Future postretirement medical benefit costs were
forecasted assuming an initial annual increase of 9.00%,
decreasing to 5.00% by the year 2013 and with consistent annual
increases at those ultimate levels thereafter.

Assumed health care cost trends have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for the
postretirement medical plans. A one-percent change in assumed
health care cost trend rates would have the following effects
(in millions):

Because the UPS Excess Coordinating Plan is not
funded, the Company has recorded an additional minimum pension
liability for this plan of $105 and $88 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This liability is
included in the other credits and non-current liabilities
portion of Note 9. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
the Company has recorded an intangible asset of $5 and
$7 million, respectively, representing the net unrecognized
prior service cost for this plan. A total of $63 and
$50 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, was recorded as a reduction of other comprehensive
income in Shareowners’ Equity (net of the tax effect of $37
and $31 million, respectively). The unfunded accumulated
benefit obligation of the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan
was $154 and $121 million as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

Plan Assets

The following table provides a reconciliation of
the changes in the plans’ assets as of September 30
(in millions):

The asset allocation for our pension and other
postretirement plans as of September 30, 2003 and 2002, and
the target allocation for 2004, by asset category, are as
follows:

Equity securities include UPS Class A shares
of common stock in the amounts of $392 (4.8% of total plan
assets) and $384 million (5.6% of total plan assets), as of
September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The UPS benefit plan committees establish
investment guidelines and strategies, and regularly monitor the
performance of the funds and portfolio managers. Our investment
strategy with respect to pension assets is to invest the assets
in accordance with ERISA and fiduciary standards. The long-term
primary objectives for our pension assets are to
(1) provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of
capital, without undue

F-18

exposure to risk; and protect the assets from
erosion of purchasing power, and (2) provide investment
results that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarially assumed
long-term rate of return.

Funded Status

The funded status of the plans, reconciled to the
amounts on the balance sheet, is as follows (in millions):

At September 30, 2003 and 2002, the
projected benefit obligation, the accumulated benefit obligation
and the fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a
projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets and for
pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess
of plan assets were as follows (in millions):

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
exceeds plan assets for all of our other postretirement benefit
plans.

Net Periodic Benefit Cost

Information about net periodic benefit cost for
the pension and postretirement benefit plans is as follows (in
millions):

The expected return on plan assets assumption was
developed using various market assumptions in combination with
the plans’ asset allocations and active investment
management. These assumptions and allocations were evaluated
using input from a third party consultant and various pension
plan asset managers, including their review of asset class
return expectations and long-term inflation assumptions. The
10-year U.S. Treasury yield is the foundation for all other
market assumptions and various risk premiums are added to
determine the expected return for each allocation. As of our
September 30, 2003 measurement date, it was projected that
the funds could achieve an 8.96% net return over time, using the
plans’ asset allocations and active management strategy.

Assumed health care cost trends have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for the
postretirement medical plans. A one-percent change in assumed
health care cost trend rates would have the following effects
(in millions):

Other Plans

We also contribute to several multi-employer
pension plans for which the above information is not
determinable. Amounts charged to operations for pension
contributions to these multi-employer plans were $1.066 and
$1.028 billion, and $977 million during 2003, 2002,
and 2001, respectively.

We also contribute to several multi-employer
health and welfare plans that cover both active and retired
employees for which the above information is not determinable.
Amounts charged to operations for contributions to
multi-employer health and welfare plans were $691, $604, and
$553 million during 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

a portion of the participating employees’ contributions.
Matching contributions charged to expense were $87, $79, and
$71 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, our vacation
policy for non-union employees was amended to require that
vacation pay be earned ratably throughout the year. Previously,
an employee became vested in the full year of vacation pay at
the beginning of each year. As a result of this policy change, a
credit to compensation and benefits of $197 million was
taken in the fourth quarter to reduce the vacation pay liability
as of December 31, 2002.

Note 7.     Business
Acquisitions and Dispositions

We regularly explore opportunities to make
acquisitions that would enhance our core package delivery
business and our various non-package businesses. Our
acquisitions include both domestic and international
transactions. During the three years ended December 31,
2003, we completed 10 acquisitions that were accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting. In connection with the
foregoing transactions, we paid cash (net of cash acquired) in
the aggregate amount of $30, $14, and $466 million in 2003,
2002, and 2001, respectively, and issued aggregate UPS
Class B common shares of 8.4 million in 2001. Pro
forma results of operations have not been presented for any of
the acquisitions because the effects of these transactions were
not material on either an individual or aggregate basis. The
results of operations of each acquired company are included in
our statements of consolidated income from the date of
acquisition. The purchase price allocations of acquired
companies can be modified up to one year after the date of
acquisition, however we expect such adjustments to the purchase
price allocations to be immaterial.

During 2001, we completed several acquisitions
that were added to the non-package segment. We acquired Mail
Boxes Etc., the world’s largest franchisor of independently
owned and operated business, communication, and shipping centers
worldwide, for cash of $185 million. We acquired Fritz
Companies, Inc., a freight forwarding, customs brokerage and
logistics company, for 7.3 million Class B common
shares valued at $456 million. Additionally, we acquired
First International Bancorp, Inc., a provider of structured
trade finance, commercial and government-backed lending
products, for 1.1 million Class B common shares valued
at $54 million.

During the second quarter of 2003, we sold our
Mail Technologies business unit in a transaction that increased
net income by $14 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. The
gain consisted of a pre-tax loss of $24 million recorded in
other operating expenses within the non-package segment, and a
tax benefit of $38 million recognized in conjunction with
the sale. The tax benefit exceeds the pre-tax loss from this
sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we
previously recorded for the Mail Technologies business unit was
not deductible for income tax purposes. Consequently, our tax
basis was greater than our book basis, thus producing the tax
benefit described above.

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND

During the third quarter of 2003, we sold our
Aviation Technologies business unit and recognized a pre-tax
gain of $24 million ($15 million after-tax, or $0.01
per diluted share), which is recorded in other operating
expenses within the non-package segment. The operating results
of both the Mail Technologies unit and the Aviation Technologies
unit were previously included in our non-package segment, and
were not material to our consolidated operating results in any
of the periods presented.

In January 2004, we announced the acquisition of
the remaining 49% minority interest in UPS Yamato Express Co.,
which is currently joint venture with Yamato Transport Co. in
Japan. UPS Yamato Express provides express package delivery
services in Japan. Upon the close of the acquisition, UPS Yamato
Express will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of UPS. The
acquisition of UPS Yamato Express Co. will not have a material
effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Note 8.     Long-Term
Debt and Commitments

Long-term debt, as of December 31, consists
of the following (in millions):

(i)

On January 22, 1998, we exchanged
    $276 million of an original $700 million in debentures
    for new debentures of equal principal with a maturity of
    April 1, 2030. The new debentures have the same interest
    rate as the 8 3/8% debentures due 2020 until April 1,
    2020, and, thereafter, the interest rate will be 7.62% for the
    final 10 years. The 2030 debentures are redeemable in whole
    or in part at our option at any time. The redemption price is
    equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount and accrued
    interest or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payouts of principal and interest thereon discounted
    to the date of redemption at a benchmark treasury yield plus
    five basis points plus accrued interest. The remaining
    $424 million of 2020 debentures are not subject to
    redemption prior to maturity. Interest is payable semiannually
    on the first of April and October for both debentures and
    neither debenture is subject to sinking fund requirements.

The weighted average interest rate on the
    commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2003 and

    terminated the swap transaction associated with the notes. The
    redemption amount paid was lower than the amount recorded for
    the fair value of the notes at the time of redemption, which,
    along with the cash settlement received on the swap, resulted in
    a $28 million gain recorded in 2003 results.

The UPS Notes program involves the periodic
    issuance of fixed rate notes in $1,000 increments with various
    terms and maturities. At December 31, 2003, the coupon
    rates of the outstanding notes varied between 3.00% and 6.25%,
    and the interest payments are made either monthly, quarterly or
    semiannually. The maturities of the notes range from 2006 to
    2018. Substantially all of the fixed obligations associated with
    the notes were swapped to floating rates, based on different
    LIBOR indices plus or minus a spread. The average interest rate
    payable on the swaps for 2003 and 2002 was 0.8% and 1.5%,
    respectively.

Based on the borrowing rates currently available
    to the Company for long-term debt with similar terms and
    maturities, the fair value of long-term debt, including current
    maturities, is approximately $4.1 and $4.9 billion as of
    December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

We lease certain aircraft, facilities, equipment
    and vehicles under operating leases, which expire at various
    dates through 2054. Certain of the leases contain escalation
    clauses and renewal or purchase options. Rent expense related to
    our operating leases was $678, $685 and $747 million for 2003,
    2002 and 2001, respectively. The following table sets forth the
    aggregate minimum lease payments under

    annual principal payments due under our long-term debt, and the
    aggregate amounts expected to be spent for purchase commitments
    (in millions).

As of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding
letters of credit totaling approximately $1.667 billion
issued in connection with routine business requirements.

We maintain two credit agreements with a
consortium of banks that provide revolving credit facilities of
$1.0 billion each, with one expiring April 22, 2004
and the other April 24, 2008. Interest on any amounts we
borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR
plus 15 basis points. At December 31, 2003, there were no
outstanding borrowings under these facilities. In addition, we
maintain an extendible commercial notes program under which we
are authorized to borrow up to $500 million. No amounts
were outstanding under this program at December 31, 2003.

We have a $2.0 billion shelf registration
statement under which we may issue debt securities in the
U.S. The debt may be denominated in a variety of
currencies. There was approximately $85 million issued
under this shelf registration statement at December 31,
2003. We also maintain a $1.0 billion European medium-term
note program. Under this program, we may issue notes from time
to time, denominated in a variety of currencies. At
December 31, 2003, $1.0 billion was available under
this program.

Legal Proceedings and Contingencies

On August 9, 1999 the United States Tax
Court Tax Court held that we were liable for tax on income of
Overseas Partners Ltd., a Bermuda company that had reinsured EV
insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that
we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax
years. The IRS took

F-25


UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

similar positions to those advanced in the Tax
Court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984 through 1998. On
June 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the Tax Court decision.
In January 2003, we and the IRS finalized settlement of all
outstanding tax issues related to EV package insurance. Under
the terms of settlement, we agreed to adjustments that will
result in income tax due of approximately $562 million,
additions to tax of $60 million and related interest. The
amount due to the IRS as a result of the settlement is less than
amounts we previously had accrued. As a result, we recorded
income, before taxes, of $1.023 billion ($776 million
after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2002. The refunds and
credits associated with this settlement are expected to occur
over the next several years.

The IRS has proposed adjustments, unrelated to
the EV package insurance matters discussed above, regarding the
allowance of deductions and certain losses, the characterization
of expenses as capital rather than ordinary, the treatment of
certain income, and our entitlement to the investment tax credit
and the research tax credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years.
The proposed adjustments would result in $10 million of
additional income tax. The IRS has also issued a report taking a
similar position with respect to some of these issues for each
of the years from 1991 through 1994. That report proposes
adjustments that would result in $42 million in additional
income tax. The IRS’s proposed adjustments include
penalties and penalty interest. We believe that the possibility
that such penalties and penalty interest will be sustained is
remote. In November 2002, the IRS issued a report taking a
similar position with respect to some of these issues for each
of the years 1995 through 1998. That report proposes adjustments
that would result in $7 million in additional income tax.
For the 1985 through 1998 tax years, unpaid interest on these
adjustments through December 31, 2003 could aggregate up to
approximately $178 million, after the benefit of related
tax deductions. We expect that we will prevail on substantially
all of these issues. Specifically, we believe that our practice
of expensing the items that the IRS alleges should have been
capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry
participants. The IRS may take similar positions with respect to
some of these issues for each of the years 1999 through 2003. We
believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity.

We are named as a defendant in twenty-three
pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection
of premiums for excess value (“EV”) insurance in
connection with package shipments since 1984. Based on state and
federal tort, contract and statutory claims, these cases
generally claim that we failed to remit collected EV premiums to
an independent insurer; we failed to provide promised EV
insurance; we acted as an insurer without complying with state
insurance laws and regulations; and the price for EV insurance
was excessive. These actions all were filed after the
August 9, 1999 United States Tax Court decision.

These twenty-three cases have been consolidated
for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation proceeding
(“MDL Proceeding”) in federal court in New York. In
addition to the cases in which UPS is named as a defendant,
there also is an action, Smith v. Mail Boxes Etc., against Mail
Boxes Etc. and its franchisees relating to UPS EV insurance and
related services purchased through Mail Boxes Etc. centers. This
case also has been consolidated into the MDL Proceeding.

While expressly denying any and all liability,
the parties have obtained preliminary court approval of a global
settlement resolving all claims and all cases in the MDL
Proceeding. The proposed settlement requires several steps
before it becomes final, including notice to the settlement
class, and obtaining final court approval. If the proposed
settlement becomes final, we would provide to qualifying
settlement class members vouchers toward the purchase of
specified UPS services and pay a portion of the plaintiffs’
attorneys’ fees, the total amount of which will be
determined by the Court. The ultimate cost to us of the proposed
settlement will depend on a number of factors. We do not believe
that this proposed settlement will have a material effect on our
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

In addition, we are a defendant in various other
lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe
that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations, or liquidity.

We participate in a number of trustee-managed
multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for
employees covered under collective bargaining agreements.
Several factors could result in higher future contributions to
these plans, including unfavorable investment performance,
changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants.
At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of
additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flows could result from our participation in
these plans.

Note 11.

Capital Stock and Stock-Based
    Compensation

Capital Stock

We maintain two classes of common stock, which
are distinguished from each other by their respective voting
rights. Class A shares of UPS are entitled to ten votes per
share, whereas Class B shares are entitled to one vote per
share. Class A shares are primarily held by UPS employees,
and these shares are fully convertible into Class B shares
at any time. Class B shares are publicly traded on the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “UPS”.

Incentive
Compensation Plan

The UPS Incentive Compensation Plan permits the
grant of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares,
performance units, and management incentive awards to eligible
employees. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the
Plan is 112 million, with the number of shares reserved for
issuance as restricted stock limited to 34 million. As of
December 31, 2003, management incentive awards, stock
options, and restricted stock performance units had been granted
under the Incentive Compensation Plan.

Management
Incentive Awards

Persons earning the right to receive Management
Incentive Awards are determined annually by the Compensation
Committee of the UPS Board of Directors. This Committee, in its
sole discretion, determines the total award, which consists of
UPS Class A common stock, given in any year. Amounts
expensed for Management Incentive Awards were $606, $556, and
$651 million during 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

Nonqualified
Stock Options

We maintain fixed stock option plans under which
options are granted to purchase shares of UPS Class A
common stock. Prior to adoption of the Incentive Compensation
Plan, these options were granted at the current price of UPS
shares as determined by the UPS Board of Directors on the date
of option grant. Stock options granted in connection with the
Incentive Compensation Plan must have an exercise price at least
equal to the NYSE closing price of UPS class B common stock
on the date the option was granted.

Persons earning the right to receive stock
options are determined each year by the Compensation Committee
and the UPS Board of Directors. Except in the case of death,
disability or retirement, options granted prior to the adoption
of our Incentive Compensation Plan are exercisable only during a
limited period after the expiration of five years from the date
of grant, while options granted under the Incentive Compensation
Plan are generally exercisable after three years from the date
of grant and before the expiration of the option ten years after
the date of grant. All options granted are subject to earlier
cancellation or exercise under certain conditions.

The following is an analysis of options to
purchase shares of Class A common stock issued and
outstanding:

Options were granted to eligible employees under
the 1996 Stock Option Plan in March 1999, but options will no
longer be granted under that plan. Beginning in November 1999,
options were granted under the Incentive Compensation Plan, and
a limited option grant to certain employees under this plan
occurred in 2000. Beginning in 2001 and in future years, options
to eligible employees will generally be granted annually during
the first half of each year at the discretion of the Board of
Directors.

During 2001, we assumed employee stock options in
connection with our acquisitions of Fritz Companies, Inc. and
First International Bancorp, Inc. (see Note 7), which were
converted into options to purchase UPS Class A common
shares. Existing stock option plans at Fritz Companies, Inc.
were assumed by UPS; however, options will no longer be granted
under these plans. Existing stock option plans at First
International Bancorp, Inc. were terminated upon the completion
of the acquisition.

The following table summarizes information about
stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31,
2003:

Restricted Performance Units

During 2003, we issued restricted performance
units under the Incentive Compensation Plan. Upon vesting,
restricted performance units result in the issuance of the
equivalent number of UPS Class A common shares. Persons
earning the right to receive restricted performance units are
determined each year by the Compensation Committee and the UPS
Board of Directors. Except in the case of death, disability or
retirement, restricted performance units vest five years after
the date of grant. All restricted performance units granted are
subject to earlier cancellation or exercise under certain
conditions. During 2003, we issued 1.164 million restricted
performance units with a weighted average fair value of $62.40.

Discounted Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan

During 2001, we initiated an employee stock
purchase plan for all eligible employees. Under the plan, shares
of UPS Class A common stock may be purchased at quarterly
intervals at 90% of the lower of the NYSE closing price on the
first or the last day of each quarterly period. Employees
purchased 1.9, 1.8 and 0.4 million shares at average prices
of $54.08, $50.79 and $46.78 per share during 2003, 2002, and
2001, respectively.

Deferred Compensation
    Arrangements

We maintain a deferred compensation plan whereby
certain employees may elect to defer the gains on stock option
exercises by deferring the shares received upon exercise into a
rabbi trust. The shares held in this trust are classified as
treasury stock, and the liability to participating employees is
classified as “Deferred Compensation Arrangements” in
the shareowners’ equity section of the balance sheet. The
amount of shares needed to settle the liability for deferred
compensation arrangements is included in the denominator in both
the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

Note 12.

Segment and Geographic Information

We report our operations in three segments:
U.S. domestic package operations, international package
operations and non-package operations. Package operations
represent our core business and are broken down into regional
operations around the world. Regional operations managers are
responsible for both domestic and export operations within their
geographic area.

U.S. Domestic Package

Domestic package operations include the
time-definite delivery of letters, documents, and packages
throughout the United States.

International Package

International package operations include delivery
to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide,
including shipments wholly outside the U.S. as well as
shipments with either origin or distribution outside the
U.S. Our international package reporting segment includes
the operations of our Europe, Asia-Pacific, Canada, and Americas
operating segments.

Non-Package

Non-package operations include UPS Supply Chain
Solutions, Mail Boxes Etc. (the franchisor of Mail Boxes Etc.
and The UPS Store), UPS Capital Corp., our mail and consulting
services, and our excess value package insurance business. UPS
Supply Chain Solutions, which is comprised of our former UPS
Freight Services and UPS Logistics Group businesses, provides
supply chain design and management, freight forwarding, and
customs brokerage services.

In evaluating financial performance, we focus on
operating profit as a segment’s measure of profit or loss.
Operating profit is before investment income, interest expense,
and income taxes. The accounting policies of the reportable
segments are the same as those described in the summary of
accounting policies (see Note 1), with certain expenses
allocated between the segments using activity-based costing
methods. Unallocated assets are comprised primarily of cash,
marketable securities and short-term investments.

Note 14.     Income
Taxes

The income tax expense (benefit) for the years
ended December 31 consists of the following (in millions):

Income before income taxes includes income of
foreign subsidiaries of $237, $16, and $8 million in 2003,
2002, and 2001, respectively.

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income
tax rate to the effective income tax rate for the years ended
December 31 consists of the following:

During the first quarter of 2003, we reduced
deferred taxes by $55 million due to the favorable
resolution of several outstanding contingency matters with the
IRS. During the third quarter of 2003, we reduced deferred taxes
by $22 million as a result of a favorable tax court ruling
in relation to an outstanding contingency matter with the IRS.

After filing our 2002 state tax returns during
the fourth quarter of 2003, we completed a review of the
taxability of our operations in various state taxing
jurisdictions and the effects of available state tax credits. As
a result of this review, we recorded a decrease of
$39 million in the income tax provision in the fourth
quarter of 2003. This decrease includes a reduction in our
estimated state tax liabilities and the effect of the estimated
state income tax effective rate applied to our temporary
differences.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised
of the following at December 31 (in millions):

The valuation allowance increased by $25 and $23,
and decreased by $32 million during the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

We have foreign loss carryforwards of
approximately $1.035 billion as of December 31, 2003,
the majority of which may be carried forward indefinitely. These
foreign loss carryforwards have been fully reserved in the
deferred tax assets valuation allowance due to the uncertainty
resulting from a lack of previous foreign taxable income within
certain foreign tax jurisdictions.

Undistributed earnings of our foreign
subsidiaries amounted to approximately $727 million at
December 31, 2003. Those earnings are considered to be
indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. federal
and state deferred income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon
distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or
otherwise, we would be subject to both U.S. income taxes
(subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and
withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred
U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of the
complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

Earnings Per Share

The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions except per
share amounts):

Diluted earnings per share for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 exclude the effect of
0.1, 0.1, and 6.6 million shares, respectively, of common
stock that may be issued upon the exercise of employee stock
options because such effect would be antidilutive.

Note 16.

Derivative Instruments and Risk
    Management

We are exposed to market risk, primarily related
to foreign exchange, commodity prices, equity prices and
interest rates. These exposures are actively monitored by
management. To manage the volatility relating to these
exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative financial
instruments. Our objective is to reduce, where it is deemed
appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows
associated with changes in foreign currency rates, commodity
prices, equity prices, and interest rates. It is our policy and
practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the
extent necessary to manage exposures. As we use price sensitive
instruments to hedge a certain portion of our existing and
anticipated transactions, we expect that any loss in value for
those instruments generally would be offset by increases in the
value of those hedged transactions.

We do not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Commodity Price Risk
    Management

We are exposed to an increase in the prices of
refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline.
Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of
other energy products, principally natural gas and electricity.
We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to
provide partial protection from rising fuel and energy prices.
The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk,
excluding the

F-34


UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

underlying exposures, as of December 31,
2003 and 2002 was an asset (liability) of approximately $30 and
$34 million, respectively. We have designated and account
for these contracts as cash flow hedges, and, therefore, the
resulting gains and losses from these hedges are recognized as a
component of fuel expense or other occupancy expense when the
underlying fuel or energy product being hedged is consumed.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
    Management

We have foreign currency risks related to our
revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in
currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate.
We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in
functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated
assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant
foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro and the British
Pound Sterling. We use a combination of purchased and written
options and forward contracts to hedge currency cash flow
exposures. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the net fair
value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset
(liability) of approximately $(48) and $(3) million,
respectively. We have designated and account for these contracts
as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated
revenue and, therefore, the resulting gains and losses from
these hedges are recognized as a component of international
revenue when the underlying sales occur.

Interest Rate Risk Management

Our indebtedness under our various financing
arrangements creates interest rate risk. We use a combination of
derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and
cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to
manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total
debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These
swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the
debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount,
interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the
terms of the associated debt. Interest rate swaps allow us to
maintain a target range of floating rate debt.

We have designated and account for these
contracts as either hedges of the fair value of the associated
debt instruments, or as hedges of the variability in expected
future interest payments. Any periodic settlement payments are
accrued monthly, as either a charge or credit to interest
expense, and are not material to net income. The net fair value
of our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2003 and 2002
was an asset (liability) of approximately $(27) and
$(62) million, respectively.

Equity Price Risk Management

We hold investments in various available-for-sale
equity securities which are subject to price risk. We use
combinations of options to hedge the price risk exposure
inherent in these securities. The fair value of such options
contracts designated as hedges, as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, was an asset of approximately $0 and $219 million,
respectively, which is classified in marketable securities and
short-term investments. A large investment derivative used to
hedge equity price risk settled in 2003 (which resulted in UPS
receiving cash of $222 million) resulting in the decline in
value of our investment derivatives since December 31, 2002.

Credit Risk

The forward contracts, swaps, and options
previously discussed contain an element of risk that the
counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the
agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these
instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and
financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines.
We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty
default.

Derivatives Not Designated As
    Hedges

Derivatives not designated as hedges primarily
consist of interest rate swaps that are used to hedge a
portfolio of small debt instruments. Although these instruments
are effective as hedges from an economic perspective, they do
not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, as amended.
The impact from these interest rate swaps on our results was
immaterial. Additionally, we have a small portfolio of stock
warrants in public and private companies that are held for
investment purposes. These warrants are recorded at fair value,
and the impact of these warrants on our results was immaterial
for each of the three years ending December 31, 2003.

Income Effects of Derivatives

In the context of hedging relationships,
“effectiveness” refers to the degree to which fair
value changes in the hedging instrument offset corresponding
changes in the hedged item. Certain elements of hedge positions
cannot qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133 whether
effective or not, and must therefore be marked to market through
income. Both the effective and ineffective portions of gains and
losses on hedges are reported in the income statement category
related to the hedged exposure. Both the ineffective portion of
hedge positions and the elements excluded from the measure of
effectiveness were immaterial for each of the three years ending
December 31, 2003.

As of December 31, 2003, $37 million in
losses related to cash flow hedges that are currently deferred
in OCI are expected to be reclassified to income over the
12 month period ending December 31, 2004. The actual
amounts that will be reclassified to income over the next
12 months will vary from this amount as a result of changes
in market conditions. No amounts were reclassified to income
during 2003 in connection with forecasted transactions that were
no longer considered probable of occurring.

At December 31, 2003, the maximum term of
derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions,
except those related to cross-currency interest rate swaps on
existing financial instruments, was 4 years. We maintain
cross-currency interest rate swaps that extend through 2009.

Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, our financial
instruments included cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities and short-term investments, accounts receivable,
finance receivables, accounts payable, short-term and long-term
borrowings, and commodity, interest rate, foreign currency, and
equity options, forwards, and swaps. The fair values of cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable
approximate carrying values because of the short-term nature of
these instruments. The fair value of our marketable securities
and short-term investments is disclosed in Note 2, finance
receivables in Note 3, and debt instruments in Note 8.

Note 17.

Restructuring Charge and Related
    Expenses

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we initiated a
restructuring program to combine UPS Freight Services and the
UPS Logistics Group into a single business unit (“Supply
Chain Solutions”). In connection with this restructuring
program, we also recorded certain costs related to the
integration of activities between UPS Capital and First
International Bank. The program was designed to facilitate
business growth, streamline management decision-making, reduce
the cost structure, and provide higher levels of service to our
customers. Costs of the program included employee severance
costs, asset impairments, costs associated with the
consolidation of facilities, and other costs directly related to
the restructuring program. As of December 31, 2003, the
restructuring program was substantially complete.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A summary of the amounts expensed under the
restructuring program follows below. The costs incurred in
connection with this program are classified in other operating
expenses in the income statement (see Note 13).

Employee severance costs relate to severance
packages for approximately 800 people. The packages are
involuntary and are formula-driven based on salary levels and
past service. Asset impairment charges consist primarily of
capitalized software that is no longer used as a result of
changes in business strategy due to the restructuring. Facility
consolidation costs are associated with terminating operating
leases on offices, warehouses, and other facilities. Other costs
consist primarily of employee relocations, legal costs
associated with establishing the new organizational structure,
costs associated with moving equipment, records, inventories
between locations, and conforming accounting policies among
recently acquired entities within Supply Chain Solutions.

September 11, 2001 Events

In response to the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks, the FAA issued a federal ground stop order
prohibiting all flights to, from, and within the United States.
Due to this order, all domestic UPS aircraft were grounded, and
international flights into the United States were diverted, on
September 11th and 12th. We were able to transport many of
our express shipments through our extensive ground network until
the FAA order was lifted and our air operations resumed on the
evening of September 13th. Due to the economic disruption
caused by these events, we sustained significant declines in our
U.S. origin package volume during the weeks following the
attacks.

On September 22, 2001, President Bush signed
into law the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization
Act (the “Act”), a $15 billion emergency economic
assistance package to mitigate the dramatic financial losses
experienced by the nation’s air carriers. The Act, among
other things, provides for the following:
(1) $5 billion in compensation for direct losses
incurred as a result of the federal ground stop order, and for
incremental losses incurred through December 31 as a result
of the attacks, (2) $10 billion in federal loan
guarantees and credits, (3) expanded war risk insurance
coverage for air carriers, and (4) government assistance
for short-term increases in insurance premiums. We submitted a
claim for compensation to the Department of Transportation and
recognized a pre-tax amount of $74 million related to this
reimbursement as a credit to the other expenses line item of
other operating expenses (see Note 13) in 2001 under
the provisions of EITF 01-10 “Accounting for the
Impact of Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001”.
