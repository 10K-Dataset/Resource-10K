PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

We are a leading, diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and pari-mutuel properties. The Company was
incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1982 as PNRC Corp. and adopted its current name in 1994, when the Company became a public company. In 1997, we began our transition from a pari-mutuel
company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the Charles Town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in West Virginia. Since 1997, we have continued to expand our
gaming operations through strategic acquisitions (including the acquisitions of Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis and Boomtown Biloxi, CRC Holdings, Inc., the Bullwhackers properties,
Hollywood Casino Corporation, Argosy Gaming Company ("Argosy"), Black Gold Casino at Zia Park, and Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club), greenfield projects (such as at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race
Course and Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway) and property expansions (such as at Charles Town Entertainment Complex and Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg). We currently own or manage nineteen facilities
in fifteen jurisdictions, including Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ontario.

We
believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with a diversified cash flow from operations. We intend to continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation of a
disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties and the continued pursuit of strategic acquisitions and the development of gaming properties, particularly in attractive regional
markets. Current capital projects are ongoing at several of our existing properties, including Empress Casino Hotel, Charles Town Entertainment Complex, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course,
and Hollywood Casino Perryville, as well as at our proposed facilities in Kansas and Ohio.

In
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms "we," "us," "our," the "Company" and "Penn National" refer to Penn National Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries, unless
the context indicates otherwise.

Merger Announcement and Termination

On June 15, 2007, we announced that we had entered into a merger agreement that, at the effective time of the transactions
contemplated thereby, would have resulted in our shareholders receiving $67.00 per share. Specifically, we, PNG Acquisition Company Inc. ("Parent") and PNG Merger Sub Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), announced that we had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 15, 2007 (the "Merger Agreement"), that provided, among
other things, for Merger Sub to be merged with and into us, as a result of which we would have continued as the surviving corporation and would have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent
is indirectly owned by certain funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group LLC ("Fortress") and Centerbridge Partners, L.P. ("Centerbridge").

On
July 3, 2008, we entered into an agreement with certain affiliates of Fortress and Centerbridge, terminating the Merger Agreement. In connection with the termination of the
Merger Agreement, we agreed to receive a total of $1.475 billion, consisting of a nonrefundable $225 million cash termination fee and a $1.25 billion, zero coupon, preferred
equity investment (the "Investment"). On October 30, 2008, we closed the sale of the Investment and issued 12,500 shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock.

indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, CRC Holdings, Inc. The compensation under the Agreement is a base fee equal to 2.0% of gross revenues of the casino and an incentive fee equal to 5.0% of the
casino's net operating profit.

The
Agreement terminates on July 31, 2011, and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation has the option to extend the term of the Agreement for two successive periods of five
years each, commencing on August 1, 2011.

Noncontrolling Interests

In November 2009, we entered into an agreement with Lakes Entertainment, Inc. ("Lakes"), permitting Lakes to invest in up to a
10% equity interest in each of our proposed facilities in Columbus and Toledo, Ohio. During the year ended December 31, 2009, Lakes contributed $1.9 million to us towards the proposed
facilities, and its portion of the net loss for the proposed facilities was $2.5 million. The noncontrolling interest is included in shareholders' equity within our consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2009, stated separately from our shareholders' equity.

Trademarks

We own a number of trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("U.S. PTO"), including but not limited to,
"Telebet," "The World Series of Handicapping," and "Players' Choice." We also have a number of trademark applications pending with the U.S. PTO.

BTN, Inc.,
our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a License Agreement with Boomtown, Inc., dated August 8, 2000 pursuant to which it uses "Boomtown" and other
trademarks.

As
a result of our acquisitions of Hollywood Casino Corporation and Argosy, we own the service marks "Hollywood Casino" and "Argosy" which are registered with the U.S. PTO. We believe
that our rights to the "Hollywood Casino" and "Argosy" service marks are well established and have competitive value to the Hollywood Casino and Argosy properties. We also acquired other trademarks
used by the Hollywood Casino and Argosy facilities and their related services. These marks are either registered or are the subject of pending applications with the U.S. PTO.

Competition

Gaming Operations

The gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including riverboat casinos,
dockside casinos, land-based casinos, video lottery and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming, Internet gaming and other forms of gambling in the U.S. In a broader
sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including: shopping; high school, collegiate and professional athletic events; television and
movies; concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S., in several Canadian provinces and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of
certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have facilities (such as in Kansas, Ohio and Maryland), have legalized,
and are likely to implement gaming in the near future. In addition, established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing



gaming
operations. New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons will increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us.

Charles Town, West Virginia.

Our gaming machine operations at the Charles Town Entertainment Complex face competition in the
neighboring states of
Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey. On December 5, 2009, the citizens of Jefferson County, West Virginia, voted to authorize the placement of table games at the Charles Town Entertainment
Complex. The table games are expected to be operational in the third quarter of 2010. In Pennsylvania, there are slot operations at Philadelphia Park, Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs, Chester Downs, The
Meadows, Mount Airy Casino Resort, The Rivers, Presque Isle Downs, and Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course (which is also our property). These additions have had a negative impact on our
business from Pennsylvania; however, we estimate that less than 7% of our slot revenue is derived from this region. In January 2010, the Pennsylvania legislature passed legislation permitting table
games for gaming licensees. In November 2008, the citizens of Maryland approved a referendum to allow up to 15,000 slot machines at five locations throughout the state. These locations include a
facility in each of Cecil, Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore City and Worchester counties. Applications for each of the gaming zones were submitted in February 2009. The first facility scheduled to
open in Maryland, Hollywood Casino Perryville, which is owned by us, is expected to open in late 2010. This will be the only Maryland facility which will be operational in 2010. Particularly as the
Anne Arundel and Baltimore facilities open, Charles Town Entertainment Complex will face increased competition and its results will be
negatively impacted. Any additional increase in the competition in the region could negatively impact the results of operations of Charles Town Entertainment Complex.

Lawrenceburg, Indiana.

The Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg is the closest casino to the Cincinnati metropolitan area, and faces
competition from two
other riverboat casinos in the Cincinnati market, plus two racetrack casinos in the greater Indianapolis area. The nearest competitor is located approximately 15 miles further south of Lawrenceburg in
Rising Sun, Indiana. Another competitor is located 40 miles from Lawrenceburg in Switzerland County, Indiana. In 2007, the Indiana Legislature passed a law allowing up to 2,000 slot machines at each
of two racetracks in Indianapolis, approximately 90 miles northwest of Lawrenceburg. Both of these racetracks re-opened with slots in June 2008. One of the two racinos opened their slot
operations in a temporary facility and then opened a permanent structure in March 2009. These two Indianapolis racinos have adversely affected our gaming revenue, particularly from the Indianapolis
feeder market. Casino gaming is not currently permitted under the laws of Kentucky, although legislation has been introduced to allow gaming at racetracks and casinos subject to referendum. Ohio
voters passed a referendum in 2009 to allow four land-based casinos in four cities in the state of Ohio. One of them will be in downtown Cincinnati, which is a major feeder market for our
Lawrenceburg property. The commencement of casino gaming in Ohio or Kentucky will have an adverse effect on the financial results of our Lawrenceburg casino.

Grantville, Pennsylvania.

The Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act, which was signed in 2004, authorized up to 5,000 slot
machines at
each of seven harness/thoroughbred racetracks and five stand-alone slot facilities, as well as 500 slot machines at each of two authorized resort facilities. Currently, slot machines are authorized
and operating at six of the seven existing racetrack facilities, as well as three stand-alone facilities. In January 2010, the Pennsylvania legislature passed legislation permitting table games for
gaming licensees. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board is in the process of creating a regulatory framework with regard to table games and has estimated that it will be six to nine months before
table games can become operational. The new legislation increases the number of category 3 licenses from two to three. A category 3 license allows the licensed facility to operate up to
500 slot machines; however, a category 3 licensed facility holding a table game operation certificate will be entitled to operate 600 slot machines and 50 table games. One category 3
license application has been granted, but no license has been issued, pending resolution of a challenge before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. There are also proposed sites in each of Gettysburg
and the Reading area for a category 3 license. If any of these sites begin slot operations, it will have a negative impact on Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course.



Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course faces competition from these other Pennsylvania facilities, as well as casinos located in Delaware, New Jersey, and
West Virginia. In addition, Hollywood Casino Perryville, which is owned by us, is expected to open in late 2010, and our property in West Virginia received approval in late 2009 to operate table
games, both of which could negatively impact the operations of Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course.

In
2008, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed legislation which authorized a partial ban on smoking in casino facilities, including a limit on the amount of casino floor space that
could be designated as "smoking." Early in 2009, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course was able to expand smoking sections to 50% of its casino floor. The legislation does not allow any
further expansion of smoking areas.

Chicagoland.

Aurora and Joliet are part of the Chicagoland market that includes properties in the Chicago suburbs in both Illinois and
northern
Indiana. Hollywood Casino Aurora and Empress Casino Hotel face competition from numerous other riverboat casinos in the Chicago-area market, dockside casinos that are located in Illinois
and dockside casinos that are located in Indiana. Due to significantly higher gaming taxes imposed on Illinois riverboats, the Indiana riverboats have been able to spend greater amounts on marketing
and other amenities, which has significantly increased their ability to compete with the Illinois riverboats. Any increase in gaming taxes or admission fees imposed on Illinois riverboats could have
an adverse impact on the financial results of
our Chicagoland casinos. Effective January 1, 2008, casinos in Illinois became smoke-free due to state legislation and smoking areas are required to be outside of the facility. The
casinos in Indiana continue to have smoking permitted in all areas providing them with a significant competitive advantage. In addition, after a major remodel, Harrah's reopened the Horseshoe casino
in northern Indiana in August 2008 which has impacted the revenues of the Illinois riverboats in 2009.

New
competition in Illinois is currently limited by state legislation. The Illinois Riverboat Gambling Act and the regulations promulgated by the Illinois Gaming Board under the
Riverboat Gambling Act authorize only 10 owner licenses for riverboat gaming operations in Illinois and permit a maximum of 1,200 gaming positions at any time for each of the 10 licensed sites. All
authorized owners' licenses have now been granted, with the final license, which was dormant for several years, being issued in December 2008. The new gaming operation is expected to be opened in the
second half of 2011 in Des Plaines, Illinois. We will face additional competition as the facility will be located in the suburban area northwest of Chicago. The legislature has considered, at various
times, legislation that would expand gaming in the state of Illinois (for example, slots at tracks). Should the Illinois legislature enact such gaming-expansion legislation, the financial results of
our Chicagoland casinos could be adversely affected.

In
July 2009, the Governor of Illinois signed a bill providing for the legalization of video poker in bars. While there have not yet been any installations of video poker machines
outside of the current 9 Illinois riverboats, it is anticipated they will arrive sometime in 2010.

Riverside, Missouri.

The Argosy Casino Riverside currently faces competition from three other casinos in its market. In November 2008,
legislation
was enacted in Missouri that increased gaming taxes, while removing the loss limit in the state. The Kansas legislature has approved the expansion of casino gaming in its state, and in February 2010,
Kansas Entertainment, LLC, a joint venture of affiliates of International Speedway Corporation and us, received the final approval under the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act, along with its gaming
license from the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission, to proceed with the development of a Hollywood-themed destination facility overlooking Turn 2 at Kansas Speedway, which is located approximately
17 miles from Argosy Casino Riverside. Kansas Entertainment, LLC will begin construction of the facility in the second half of 2010 with a planned opening in early 2012. The commencement of casino
gaming in Kansas will have an adverse effect on the financial results of Argosy Casino Riverside.



Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge faces competition from land-based and riverboat casinos throughout Louisiana and
on
the Mississippi Gulf Coast, casinos on Native American lands and from non-casino gaming opportunities
within Louisiana. The principal competitor to Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge is the Belle of Baton Rouge. We face competition from eleven casinos on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, which is approximately
120 miles east of Baton Rouge; many of these casinos are destination resorts that attract customers from the Baton Rouge area. Subsequent to Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi Gulf Coast casinos are
allowed to operate as land-based facilities. Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge also faces competition from two major riverboat casinos, one land-based casino in the New Orleans
area, which is approximately 75 miles from Baton Rouge, and three Native American casinos in Louisiana. The two closest Native American casinos are land-based facilities located
approximately 45 miles southwest and approximately 65 miles northwest of Baton Rouge. We face competition from a racetrack located approximately 55 miles from Baton Rouge operating approximately 1,500
gaming machines. We also face competition from approximately 3,000 video poker machines located in truck stops, restaurants, bars and OTWs located in certain surrounding parishes. In addition, another
gaming operator received approval from the Louisiana Gaming Control Board for a third riverboat casino in Baton Rouge that was subject to a local option referendum subsequently approved by East Baton
Rouge Parish voters on February 9, 2008. If the project receives the remaining local approvals and entitlements, and the operator is successful in raising the capital required to construct the
facility, the financial results of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge will be adversely affected.

Alton, Illinois.

The Argosy Casino Alton faces competition from five other riverboat casinos currently operating in the St. Louis,
Missouri
area, including one other Illinois licensee. In addition, a casino project in south St. Louis County is in development and scheduled to open in March 2010, which could adversely affect
business. Casinos in Illinois are smoke-free due to state legislation while casinos in Missouri continue to have smoking permitted in all areas, providing them with a significant
competitive advantage. Should the Illinois legislature enact gaming-expansion legislation or increase admission or gaming taxes, our Alton casino's financial results could be adversely affected.

Tunica County, Mississippi.

Hollywood Casino Tunica faces intense competition from nine other casinos operating in north Tunica County
and Coahoma
County. The Tunica County market is segregated into two casino clusters, Casino Center and Casino Strip, where Hollywood Casino Tunica is located, as well as three stand-alone properties. In addition,
we compete with another casino located approximately 40 miles south of the Casino Strip cluster in Coahoma County. The close proximity of the casinos in Tunica County has contributed to the
competition between casinos because it allows consumers to visit a variety of casinos in a short period of time. The Mississippi Gaming Control Act does not limit the number of licenses that may be
granted. Any significant increase in new competition in or around Tunica County could negatively impact the operations of Hollywood Casino Tunica.

Hollywood
Casino Tunica also competes to some extent with a land-based casino complex operated by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians in central Mississippi,
approximately 200 miles south and east of Memphis, Tennessee. In addition, Hollywood Casino Tunica may eventually face competition from the opening of gaming casinos closer to Memphis, such as in
DeSoto County, Mississippi, which is the only county between Tunica County and the Tennessee border. DeSoto County has defeated gaming proposals on three separate occasions, the last being in November
1996. In November 2006, Southland Park Gaming & Racing, formerly Southland Greyhound Park, in West Memphis, Arkansas, opened a $40 million gaming facility with nearly 1,000 electronic
"games of skill." The facility is located across the Mississippi River from Memphis. Casino gaming is not currently
legalized in Tennessee; however, the legalization of gaming in Tennessee could have an adverse impact on Hollywood Casino Tunica.

Mississippi Gulf Coast.

Prior to Hurricane Katrina, dockside gaming grew rapidly on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, increasing from no
dockside casinos
in March 1992 to twelve operating dockside casinos on December 31, 2004. Nine of these facilities were located in Biloxi, two were located in Gulfport and one was located in Bay
St. Louis. As of December 31, 2009, eight of the casinos in Biloxi



re-opened,
including our casino, one of the Gulfport casinos reopened and two Bay St. Louis properties opened in 2006. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, our Bay St. Louis property
was the only casino in the Bay St. Louis market, whereas there are now two casinos in the Bay St. Louis market. In addition, in the Bay St. Louis market, there are various
proposals for casinos in development, as well as expansions at existing properties, that may take place in the next few years, though none are anticipated to be completed in 2010.

During
the 2005 special session of the Mississippi legislature, a bill to allow Gulf Coast casinos to rebuild on land was approved and signed by the Governor of Mississippi. In addition,
the Mississippi Gaming Control Act does not limit the number of licenses that may be granted and there are a number of additional sites located in the Gulf Coast region that are in various stages of
development. Any significant increase in the competition in the region could negatively impact our existing operations.

Sioux City, Iowa.

The Argosy Casino Sioux City competes primarily with land-based Native American casinos that are not required to
report
gaming revenues and other operating statistics, therefore market comparisons cannot be made. We also compete with certain providers and operators of video gaming in the neighboring state of South
Dakota. Additionally, to a lesser extent, we compete with slot machines at a pari-mutuel racetrack in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and with two riverboat casinos in the Council Bluffs/Omaha,
Nebraska market, approximately 90 miles south of Sioux City.

Bangor, Maine.

Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway is the only facility with slot machines in the state of Maine. The closest competitors
offering slot
machines are Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, Newport Grand Casino in Rhode Island and Horizon's Edge casino cruise ship operating in Lynn, Massachusetts, all approximately 300 miles away. Any
significant increase in the competition in the region could negatively impact our existing operations.

Black Hawk, Colorado.

The Black Hawk gaming market is characterized by intense competition. The primary competitive factors in the
market are
location, availability and convenience of parking, number of slot machines and gaming tables, promotional incentives, types and pricing of non-gaming amenities, name recognition and
overall atmosphere. There are currently 18 gaming facilities in the Black Hawk market and 6 gaming facilities in nearby Central City.

Hobbs, New Mexico.

The closest competitors to Black Gold Casino at Zia Park are located in New Mexico, and are approximately 190 and 250
miles from
Hobbs. Hobbs is located very close to the Texas border, and the political developments in Texas are monitored closely. Currently, there is no legalized gaming in Texas which, if legalized, could
greatly impact Black Gold Casino at Zia Park. In New Mexico, the Governor signed a new compact with the tribal casinos limiting the future expansion of gaming facilities in the state.

Orillia, Ontario.

Casino Rama faces competition in Ontario from three other commercial casinos, six charity casinos and 17 racetracks
with gaming
machines in the province. All of the casinos (including Casino Rama) and gaming machine facilities are operated by or on behalf of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, an agency of the Province
of Ontario.

There
are two charity casinos and seven racetracks with gaming machine facilities that directly affect Casino Rama. The two charity casinos together have 106 gaming tables and 1,054
gaming machines. The number of gaming machines at the racetracks ranges from 240 to over 2,061 each. There are also two commercial casinos located in Niagara Falls, Ontario, 80 miles southwest of
Toronto with a total of 173 gaming tables and 4,651 gaming machines.

Racing Operations

Our racing operations face significant competition for wagering dollars from other racetracks and OTWs, some of which also offer other
forms of gaming, as well as other gaming venues such as casinos. Our account wagering operations compete with other providers of such services throughout the country. We also may face competition in
the future from new OTWs, new racetracks or new providers



of
account wagering. From time to time, states consider legislation to permit other forms of gaming. If additional gaming opportunities become available near our racing operations, such gaming
opportunities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

U.S. and Foreign Revenues

Our net revenues in the U.S. for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $2,354.5 million, $2,406.4 million and
$2,419.5 million, respectively. Our revenues from operations in Canada for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $14.8 million, $16.7 million and $17.3 million,
respectively.

Segments

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 280, "Segment Reporting," we view each
property as an operating segment, and aggregate all of our properties into one reportable segment, as we believe that they are economically similar, offer similar types of products and services, cater
to the same types of customers, and are similarly regulated.

Governmental Regulations

The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our
operations. Each of our facilities is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern
the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction
could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Our
businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to,
restrictions and



conditions
concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could
change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts
or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.

Employees and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2009, we had 14,772 full- and part-time employees.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Business

A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from our Charles Town, West Virginia and Lawrenceburg, Indiana facilities.

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 37.0% of our net revenues were collectively derived from our Charles Town and Lawrenceburg
operations. Our ability to meet our operating and
debt service requirements is substantially dependent upon the continued success of these facilities. The operations at these facilities and any of our other facilities could be adversely affected by
numerous factors, including:

•

risks related to local and regional economic and competitive conditions, such as a decline in the number of visitors to a
facility, a downturn in the overall economy in the market, a decrease in consumer spending on gaming activities in the market or an increase in competition within and outside the state in which each
property is located (for example, the effect on Charles Town of the new gaming venues now imminent in Maryland, the continuing impact of Indianapolis Downs and Hoosier Downs on Lawrenceburg, as well
as the potential impact of Ohio gaming on Lawrenceburg);

•

changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations (including changes in laws and regulations affecting gaming
operations and taxes) applicable to a facility;

•

impeded access to a facility due to weather, road construction or closures of primary access routes; and

•

the occurrence of floods and other natural disasters.

If
any of these events occur, our operating revenues and cash flow could decline significantly.

We may face disruption in integrating and managing facilities we may develop or acquire in the future.

We expect to continue pursuing expansion opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for acquisition and development of new properties, which
evaluations may include discussions and the review of confidential information after the execution of nondisclosure agreements with potential acquisition candidates, some of which may be potentially
significant in relation to our size.

We
could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our expanded or combined operations and any other properties we may acquire. The integration of any other properties we
may acquire will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business. The process of integrating properties that
we may acquire also could interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the development of new properties may involve construction, regulatory, legal and competitive risks as well as the
risks attendant to partnership deals on these development opportunities.

Management
of new properties, especially in new geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage the combined
operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. We also cannot assure you that if acquisitions are completed, that the acquired businesses will generate
sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs.

Our
ability to achieve our objectives in connection with any acquisition we may consummate may be highly dependent on, among other things, our ability to retain the senior level property
management teams of such acquisition candidates. If, for any reason, we are unable to retain these management teams following such acquisitions or if we fail to attract new capable executives, our
operations after consummation of such acquisitions could be materially adversely affected.

The
occurrence of some or all of the above described events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



We face risks related to the development and expansion of our current properties.

We expect to use a portion of our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility for significant capital
expenditures at certain of our properties. Any proposed enhancement may require us to significantly increase the size of our existing work force at those properties. We cannot be certain that
management will be able to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees to operate and manage these facilities at their optimal levels. The failure to employ the necessary work force could
adversely affect our operations and ultimately harm profitability. In addition, these enhancements could involve risks similar to construction risks including cost over-runs and delays,
market deterioration and timely receipt of required licenses, permits or authorizations. Our failure to complete any new development or expansion project as planned, on schedule, within budget or in a
manner that generates anticipated profits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We face a number of challenges prior to opening new or upgraded gaming facilities.

No assurance can be given that, when we endeavor to open new or upgraded gaming facilities, the expected timetables for opening such facilities will be met in
light of the uncertainties inherent in the development of the regulatory framework, the licensing process, legislative action and litigation.

We face significant competition from other gaming operations.

The gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including riverboat casinos, dockside casinos,
land-based casinos, video lottery and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming, Internet gaming and other forms of gambling in the United States ("U.S."). In a broader
sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including: shopping; high school, collegiate and professional athletic events; television and
movies; concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S., in several Canadian provinces and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of
certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have facilities (such as in Kansas, Ohio and Maryland), have legalized,
and are likely to implement, gaming in the near future. In addition, established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming
operations. New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons will increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us.

Gaming
competition is intense in most of the markets where we operate. As competing properties and new markets are opened (for instance, the potential new markets in Kansas, Ohio, and
Maryland, the potential competition in Baton Rouge and the new properties in St. Louis and Indianapolis), our operating results may be negatively affected. In addition, some of our direct
competitors in certain markets may have superior facilities and/or operating conditions. There could be further competition in our markets as a result of the upgrading or expansion of facilities by
existing market participants, the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes.

We
expect each existing or future market in which we participate to be highly competitive. The competitive position of each of our casino properties is discussed in detail in the
subsection entitled "Competition—Gaming Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As
our business is dependent on discretionary consumer spending, our business is adversely impacted by prolonged economic downturns, and is subject to volatility depending on the price
of energy, unemployment rates, residential real estate values, and the availability of consumer credit.

Our management service contract for Casino Rama expires on July 31, 2011.

Through CHC Casinos Canada Limited ("CHC Casinos"), our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, we manage Casino Rama, a full service gaming and entertainment
facility, on behalf of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, an agency of the Province of Ontario. Casino Rama is located on the lands of the Rama First Nation, approximately 90 miles north of
Toronto. The property has



approximately
93,000 square feet of gaming space, 2,472 gaming machines, 104 table games and 12 poker tables. In addition, the property includes a 5,000-seat entertainment facility, a
289-room hotel and 3,170 parking spaces.

The
Development and Operating Agreement (the "Agreement"), which we refer to as the management service contract for Casino Rama, sets out the duties, rights and obligations of CHC
Casinos and our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, CRC Holdings, Inc. CHC Casinos significantly relies on our experience, know-how, guidance and assistance to carry out the duties
and obligations under the Agreement. The compensation under the Agreement is a base fee equal to 2.0% of gross revenues of the casino and an incentive fee equal to 5.0% of the casino's net operating
profit.

The
Agreement terminates on July 31, 2011, and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation has the option to extend the term of the Agreement for two successive periods of five
years each, commencing on August 1, 2011.

There
can be no assurance that the Agreement will be extended beyond August 1, 2011.

We are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition.

From time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits relating to matters incidental to our business. The nature of our business subjects us to the risk of
lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business. As with all litigation, no assurance can be provided as to the
outcome of these matters and, in general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could
significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations (see, for example, the lawsuits described in Item 3 below).

We face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities.

Licensing requirements.

As owners and managers of gaming and pari-mutuel wagering
facilities, we are subject to extensive state, local and, in Canada, provincial regulation. State, local and provincial authorities require us and our subsidiaries to demonstrate suitability to obtain
and retain various licenses and require that we have registrations, permits and approvals to conduct gaming operations. Various regulatory authorities, including the Colorado Limited Gaming Control
Commission, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation-Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering, the Illinois Gaming Board, the Indiana Gaming Commission, the Iowa Gaming and
Racing Commission, the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, the Maine Gambling Control Board, the Maine Harness Racing Commission, the Mississippi State Tax Commission, the Mississippi Gaming Commission,
the Missouri Gaming Commission, the New Jersey Racing Commission, the New Mexico Gaming Control Board, the New Mexico Racing Commission, the Ohio State Racing Commission, the Pennsylvania Gaming
Control Board, the Pennsylvania State Horse Racing Commission, the West Virginia Racing Commission, the West Virginia Lottery Commission, and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, have broad
discretion, and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming
operations or prevent us from owning the securities of any of our gaming subsidiaries or prevent another person from owning an equity interest in us. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in
which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals. Regulatory authorities have input into our operations, for instance, hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, numbers and
types of machines and loss limits. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or
regulations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We
have demonstrated suitability to obtain and have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for us to operate our existing gaming and
pari-mutuel



facilities.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them or demonstrate suitability to obtain any new licenses, registrations, permits or approvals. In addition, the loss of a license in
one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction. As we expand our gaming operations in our existing jurisdictions or to new areas,
we may have to meet additional suitability requirements and obtain additional licenses, registrations, permits and approvals from gaming authorities in these jurisdictions. The approval process can be
time-consuming and costly and we cannot be sure that we will be successful.

Gaming
authorities in the U.S. generally can require that any beneficial owner of our securities file an application for a finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record
or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must generally apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by
the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate such an owner's suitability and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the
owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities.

Potential changes in legislation and regulation of our operations.

Regulations governing the conduct of gaming activities and the
obligations of
gaming companies in any jurisdiction in which we have or in the future may have gaming operations are subject to change and could impose additional operating, financial or other burdens on the way we
conduct our business.

Moreover,
legislation to prohibit, limit, or add burdens to our business may be introduced in the future in states where gaming has been legalized. In addition, from time to time,
legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions
in which we operate. Any expansion of gaming or restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations or enactment of other adverse regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results. For example, in October 2005, the Illinois House of Representatives voted to approve proposed legislation that would eliminate riverboat gambling. If the Illinois Senate had passed
that bill, our business would have been materially impacted. In addition, legislation banning smoking appears to be gaining momentum in a number of jurisdictions where we operate or seek to do
business (including passage in Illinois, Colorado and Pennsylvania in 2008). If these bans continue to be enacted, our business could be adversely affected.

Taxation and fees.

We believe that the prospect of significant revenue is one of the primary reasons that jurisdictions permit
legalized gaming. As a
result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, local and provincial income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at
any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in
the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through
increases in gaming taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more
likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes, and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any
material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.

Compliance with other laws.

We are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental,
construction and
land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages. If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.



We depend on our key personnel.

We are highly dependent on the services of Peter M. Carlino, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Timothy J. Wilmott, our President and Chief Operating
Officer, and other members of our senior management team. Our ability to retain key personnel is affected by the competitiveness of our compensation packages and the other terms and conditions of
employment, our continued ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies and our growth prospects. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and compliance risks.

Changing laws and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, generally
accepted accounting principles, and NASDAQ Global Select Market rules, are creating uncertainty for companies. These changing laws and regulations are subject to varying interpretations in many cases
due to their lack of specificity, recent issuance and/or lack of guidance. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing
bodies. In addition, further regulation of financial institutions and public companies is possible in light of recent economic events. This could result in continuing uncertainty and higher costs
regarding compliance matters. Due to our commitment to maintain high standards of compliance with laws and public disclosure, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have
resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expense. In addition, we are subject to different parties' interpretation of our compliance with these new and
changing laws and regulations. A failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could have a materially adverse effect on us. For instance, if our gaming authorities, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, our independent auditors or our shareholders and potential shareholders conclude that our compliance with the regulations is unsatisfactory, this may result in a negative public
perception of us, subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny, penalties or otherwise adversely affect us.

Inclement weather and other casualty events could seriously disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

The operations of our facilities are subject to disruptions or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties.
Because many of our gaming operations are located on or adjacent to bodies of water, these facilities are subject to risks in addition to those associated with land-based casinos,
including loss of service due to casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, flood, hurricane or other severe weather conditions. For example, in late August
2005, we closed Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, Boomtown Biloxi in Biloxi, Mississippi and Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in
anticipation of Hurricane Katrina. Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge subsequently reopened on August 30, 2005. However, due to the extensive damage sustained, operations at Boomtown Biloxi and
Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis did not resume until June 29, 2006 and August 31, 2006, respectively. In addition, several of our casinos are subject to risks generally associated
with the movement of vessels on inland waterways, including risks of collision or casualty due to river turbulence and traffic. Many of our casinos operate in areas which are subject to periodic
flooding that has caused us to experience decreased attendance and increased operating expenses. Any flood or other severe weather condition could lead to the loss of use of a casino facility for an
extended period. In terms of casualty events, on March 20, 2009, our Empress Casino Hotel, which was undergoing a $55 million renovation, was closed following a fire that started in the
land-based pavilion at the facility. All customers and employees were successfully evacuated, and the fire was contained on the land-side of the property before it could spread
to the adjacent casino barge. On June 25, 2009, the casino barge was reopened with temporary land-based facilities, and we began construction of a new land-based
pavilion.



The extent to which we can recover under our insurance policies for damages sustained at our properties in the event of future hurricanes
and casualty events could adversely affect our business.

On August 28, 2005, we closed Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi and Boomtown Biloxi casino in Biloxi, Mississippi
in anticipation of Hurricane Katrina. Due to the extensive damage sustained, operations at Boomtown Biloxi and Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis did not resume until June 29, 2006 and
August 31, 2006, respectively. In terms of casualty events, on March 20, 2009, our Empress Casino Hotel, which was undergoing a $55 million renovation, was closed following a fire
that started in the land-based pavilion at the facility. All customers and employees were successfully evacuated, and the fire was contained on the land-side of the property
before it could spread to the adjacent casino barge. On June 25, 2009, the casino barge was reopened with temporary land-based facilities, and we began construction of a new
land-based pavilion. We maintain significant property insurance, including business interruption coverage, for Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis, Boomtown Biloxi and other properties.
However, there can be no assurances that we will be fully or promptly compensated for losses at any of our facilities in the event of future hurricanes or casualty events.

We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the
environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties
or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions. From time to time, we have incurred and are incurring costs and obligations for correcting environmental noncompliance matters. To date, none of
these matters have had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the
future. In addition, as we acquire properties, we may not know the full level of exposure that we may have undertaken.

We
also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of
these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to
whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate
it properly, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent property. The Bullwhackers properties are located within the geographic footprint of the Clear Creek/Central City Superfund Site, a large
area of historic mining activity which is the subject of state and federal clean-up actions. Although we have not been named a potentially responsible party for this Superfund Site, it is
possible that as a result of our ownership and operation of these properties (on which mining may have occurred in the past), we may incur costs related to this matter in the future. Furthermore, we
are aware that there is or may be soil or groundwater contamination at certain of our facilities resulting from current or former operations. These matters are in various stages of investigation, and
we are not able at this time to estimate the costs that will be required to resolve them. Additionally, certain of the gaming chips used at many gaming properties, including ours, have been found to
contain some level of lead. Analysis by third parties has indicated the normal handling of the chips does not create a health hazard. We are in the process of evaluating potential environmental issues
and our disposal alternatives. To date, none of these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of
operations; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future.



The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us.

A majority of our revenues are attributable to slot machines operated by us at our gaming facilities. It is important, for competitive reasons, that we offer the
most popular and up to date slot machine games with the latest technology to our customers.

We
believe that a substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies. In addition, we believe that one company in
particular provided a majority of all slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years.

In
recent years, the prices of new slot machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation. Furthermore, in recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to
sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participation lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically
require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participation lease is substantially more expensive
over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.

For
competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the
continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participation lease costs, it
could hurt our profitability.

We depend on agreements with our horsemen and pari-mutuel clerks.

The Federal Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978, as amended, the West Virginia Racing Act and the Pennsylvania Racing Act require that, in order to simulcast
races, we have written agreements with the horse owners and trainers at our West Virginia and Pennsylvania race tracks. In addition, in order to operate gaming machines in West Virginia, we are
required to enter into written agreements regarding the proceeds of the gaming machines with a representative of a majority of the horse owners and trainers, a representative of a majority of the
pari-mutuel clerks and a representative of a majority of the horse breeders.

Effective
October 1, 2004, we signed an agreement with the Pennsylvania Thoroughbred Horsemen at Penn National Race Course that expires on September 30, 2011. At the
Charles Town Entertainment Complex, we have an agreement with the Charles Town Horsemen with an initial term expiring on December 31, 2011, and an agreement with the breeders that expires on
June 30, 2010. The pari-mutuel clerks at Charles Town are represented under a collective bargaining agreement with the West Virginia Division of Mutuel Clerks, which expires on
December 31, 2010. Our agreement with the Maine Harness Horsemen Association at Bangor Raceway expires on December 31, 2011. Our agreement with the Ohio Harness Horsemen Association
expires on December 31, 2012. Pennwood Racing, Inc. also has an agreement in effect with the horsemen at Freehold Raceway, which expires on December 31, 2011.

If
we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at a track, we will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting at that track and
off-track wagering facilities and, in West Virginia, we will not be permitted to operate our gaming machines. In addition, our simulcasting agreements are subject to the horsemen's
approval. If we fail to renew or
modify existing agreements on satisfactory terms, this failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Work stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits.

Some of our employees are currently represented by labor unions. A lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties or construction projects
could have an adverse effect on our



business
and results of operations. Given our large number of employees, labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry. In addition, organized labor may
benefit from new legislation or legal interpretations by the current presidential administration. Particularly, in light of current support for changes to federal and state labor laws, we cannot
provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future.

Risks Related to Our Capital Structure

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt.

We continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial health. For example, it
could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service, thereby reducing the
availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•

limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to
borrow additional funds; and

•

result in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our debt or fail to comply with the financial
and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt instruments, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders
to foreclose on our assets securing such debt.

Any
of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may incur substantial additional
indebtedness in the future, including to fund acquisitions. The terms of our existing indebtedness do not, and any future debt may not, fully prohibit us from doing so. If new debt is added to our
current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.

The volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the global economy may negatively impact our revenues and our ability to
access financing.

While we intend to finance expansion and renovation projects with existing cash, cash flow from operations and borrowing under our senior secured credit facility,
we may require additional financing to support our continued growth. However, due to the existing uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, our access to capital may not be available on terms
acceptable to us or at all. Further, if adverse regional and national economic conditions persist or worsen, we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in
consumer spending levels and could fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness.

The availability and cost of financing could have an adverse effect on business.

We intend to finance some of our current and future expansion and renovation projects primarily with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our current
senior secured credit facility and equity or debt financings. Depending on the state of the credit markets, if we are unable to finance our current or future expansion projects, we could have to adopt
one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expansion, development and renovation projects as well as capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, obtaining additional
equity financing or joint venture partners, or modifying our senior secured credit facility. Depending on credit market conditions, these sources of



funds
may not be sufficient to finance our expansion, and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our existing indebtedness contains
certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to limit or suspend expansion, acquisitions, development and
renovation projects, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us.

Our existing senior secured credit facility requires us, among other obligations, to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial tests,
including fixed charge coverage, senior leverage and total leverage ratios. In addition, our existing senior secured credit facility restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional
indebtedness, incur guarantee obligations, repay indebtedness or amend debt instruments, pay dividends, create liens on assets, make investments, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or
consolidations, make capital expenditures, or engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates and otherwise restrict corporate activities. A failure to comply with the restrictions
contained in our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our existing senior subordinated notes could lead to an event of default thereunder which could result in an acceleration
of such indebtedness. In addition, the indentures relating to our senior subordinated notes restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness (excluding certain indebtedness
under our senior secured credit facility), make certain payments and dividends or merge or consolidate. A failure to comply with the restrictions in any of the indentures governing the notes could
result in an event of default under such indenture which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness and a default under our other debt, including our existing senior subordinated notes and
our senior secured credit facility.

To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.

Based on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under our existing senior secured
credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for the next few years. We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that
future borrowings will be available to us under our existing senior secured credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including with respect to our indebtedness.
In addition, if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements may increase significantly. As we are required to satisfy amortization requirements under our existing
senior secured credit facility or as other debt matures, we may also
need to raise funds to refinance all or a portion of our debt. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including our existing senior secured credit facility, on
attractive terms, commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance the notes, extend or refinance our debt, including our existing
senior secured credit facility, will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

The price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly.

Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as variations in operating results, actions by various regulatory agencies and
legislatures, litigation, operating competition, market perceptions, progress with respect to potential acquisitions, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the
actions of rating agencies, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and news reports relating to trends in our markets or general
economic conditions.

We lease 42,348 square feet of executive office and warehouse space for buildings in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania from affiliates of

unaffiliated third parties.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings relating to personal injuries, employment matters, commercial
transactions and other matters arising in the normal course of business. We do not believe that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations. In addition, we maintain what we believe is adequate insurance coverage to further mitigate the risks of such proceedings. However, such proceedings can be costly,
time consuming and unpredictable and, therefore, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of such proceedings may not materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of
operations. Further, no assurance can be given that the amount or scope of existing insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover losses arising from such matters.

The
following proceedings could result in costs, settlements, damages, or rulings that materially impact our consolidated financial condition or operating results. In each instance, we
believe that we have meritorious defenses, claims and/or counter-claims, and intend to vigorously defend ourselves or pursue our claim.

In
conjunction with our acquisition of Argosy Gaming Company ("Argosy") in 2005, and subsequent disposition of the Argosy Casino Baton Rouge property, we became responsible for
litigation initiated in 1997 related to the Baton Rouge casino license formerly owned by Argosy. On November 26, 1997, Capitol House filed an amended petition in the Nineteenth Judicial
District Court for East Baton Rouge Parish, State of Louisiana, amending its previously filed but unserved suit against Richard Perryman, the person selected by the Louisiana Gaming Division to
evaluate and rank the applicants seeking a gaming license for East Baton Rouge Parish, and adding state law claims against Jazz Enterprises, Inc., the former Jazz Enterprises, Inc.
shareholders, Argosy, Argosy of Louisiana, Inc. and Catfish Queen Partnership in Commendam, d/b/a the Belle of Baton Rouge Casino. This suit alleged that these parties violated the Louisiana
Unfair Trade Practices Act in connection with obtaining the gaming license that was issued to Jazz Enterprises, Inc./Catfish Queen Partnership in Commendam. The plaintiff, an applicant for a
gaming license whose application was denied by the Louisiana Gaming Division, sought to prove that the gaming license was invalidly issued and to recover lost profits that the plaintiff contended it
could have earned if the gaming license had been issued to the plaintiff. On October 2, 2006, we prevailed on a partial summary judgment motion which limited plaintiff's damages to its
out-of-pocket costs in seeking its gaming license, thereby eliminating any recovery for potential lost gaming profits. On February 6, 2007, the jury returned a verdict
of $3.8 million (exclusive of statutory interest and attorneys' fees) against Jazz Enterprises, Inc. and Argosy. After ruling on post-trial motions, on September 27,
2007, the trial court entered a judgment in the amount of $1.4 million, plus attorneys' fees, costs and interest. We have the right to seek indemnification from two of the former Jazz
Enterprises, Inc. shareholders for any liability suffered as a result of such cause of action, however, there can be no assurance that the former Jazz Enterprises, Inc. shareholders will
have assets sufficient to satisfy any claim in excess of Argosy's



recoupment
rights. We established an appropriate reserve and bonded the judgment pending its appeal. Both the plaintiff and we have appealed the judgment to the First Circuit Court of Appeals in
Louisiana. On August 31, 2009, the appellate court reversed the trial court's decision and dismissed the case against Argosy in its entirety. Capitol House has requested that the Louisiana
Supreme Court take its appeal of the dismissal and that request is currently pending.

The
Illinois Legislature passed into law House Bill 1918, effective May 26, 2006, which singled out four of the nine Illinois casinos, including our Empress Casino Hotel and
Hollywood Casino Aurora, for a 3% tax surcharge to subsidize local horse racing interests. On May 30, 2006, Empress Casino Hotel and Hollywood Casino Aurora joined with the two other riverboats
affected by the law, Harrah's Joliet and the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin (collectively, the "Four Casinos"), and filed suit in the Circuit Court of the Twelfth Judicial District in Will County,
Illinois (the "Court"), asking the Court to declare the law unconstitutional. Empress Casino Hotel and Hollywood Casino Aurora began paying the 3% tax surcharge into a protest fund which accrues
interest during the pendency of the lawsuit. In two orders dated March 29, 2007 and April 20, 2007, the Court declared the law unconstitutional under the Uniformity Clause of the
Illinois Constitution and enjoined the collection of this tax surcharge. The State of Illinois requested, and was granted, a stay of this ruling. As a result, Empress Casino Hotel and Hollywood Casino
Aurora continued paying the 3% tax surcharge into the protest fund until May 25, 2008, when the 3% tax surcharge expired. The State of Illinois appealed the ruling to the Illinois Supreme
Court. On June 5, 2008, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the trial court's ruling and issued a decision upholding the constitutionality of the 3% tax surcharge. On January 21, 2009,
the Four Casinos filed a petition for certiorari, requesting the United States ("U.S.") Supreme Court to hear the case. Seven amicus curiae briefs supporting the plaintiffs' request were also filed.
On June 8, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear the case. On June 10, 2009, the Four Casinos filed a petition with the Court to open the judgment based on new evidence that
came to light during the investigation of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich that the 2006 law was procured by corruption. On
August 17, 2009, the Court dismissed the Four Casinos' petition to reopen the case, and the Four Casinos have decided not to pursue an appeal of the dismissal.

On
December 15, 2008, former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich signed Public Act No. 95-1008 requiring the Four Casinos to continue paying the 3% tax surcharge
to subsidize Illinois horse racing interests. On January 8, 2009, the Four Casinos filed suit in the Court, asking it to declare the law unconstitutional. The 3% tax surcharge being paid
pursuant to Public Act No. 95-1008 is paid into a protest fund where it accrues interest. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted on August 17, 2009.
The Four Casinos have appealed the dismissal and have filed a motion to keep the funds in the protest fund while the appeal is being litigated. The accumulated funds will be returned to Empress Casino
Hotel and Hollywood Casino Aurora if they ultimately prevail in the lawsuit.

On
June 12, 2009, the Four Casinos filed a lawsuit in Illinois Federal Court naming former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, his campaign fund, racetrack owner John Johnston, and
his two racetracks as defendants alleging a civil conspiracy in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §1962(c),(d) ("RICO"), based on an illegal
scheme to secure the enactment of the 3% tax surcharge legislation in exchange for the payment of money by Johnston and entities controlled by him. The Four Casinos also seek to impose a constructive
trust over all funds paid under the tax surcharge, and therefore all of the Illinois racetracks are named as parties to the lawsuit. The defendants in the RICO case filed motions to dismiss. On
December 7, 2009, the district court denied the motion to dismiss the RICO count, but it granted the motion to dismiss the constructive trust count, stating that it did not have jurisdiction in
this case to impose the constructive trust. The Four Casinos have appealed this dismissal to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellate court has ordered that any monies disbursed to the
tracks be maintained until the appeal has been decided.

In
August 2007, a complaint was filed on behalf of a putative class of our public shareholders, and derivatively on behalf of us, in the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County,
Pennsylvania (the



"Complaint").
The Complaint names our Board of Directors as defendants and us as a nominal defendant. The Complaint alleges, among other things, that the Board of Directors breached their fiduciary
duties by agreeing to the proposed transaction with Fortress Investment Group, LLC ("Fortress") and Centerbridge Partners, L.P. ("Centerbridge") for inadequate consideration, that
certain members of the Board of Directors have conflicts with regard to the Merger, and that we and our Board of Directors have failed to disclose certain material information with regard to the
Merger. The Complaint seeks, among other things, a court order determining that the action is properly maintained as a class action and a derivative action enjoining us and our Board of Directors from
consummating the proposed Merger, and awarding the payment of attorneys' fees and expenses. We and the plaintiff had reached a tentative settlement, contingent upon consummation of the transaction
with Fortress and Centerbridge, in which we agreed to pay certain attorneys' fees and to make certain disclosures regarding the events leading up to the transaction with Fortress and Centerbridge in
the proxy statement sent to shareholders in November 2007. The case was terminated by the court for inactivity on September 7, 2009, and no payments were made.

On
July 16, 2008, we were served with a purported class action lawsuit brought by plaintiffs seeking to represent a class of shareholders who purchased shares of our Common Stock
between March 20, 2008 and July 2, 2008. The lawsuit alleges that our disclosure practices relative to the proposed transaction with Fortress and Centerbridge and the eventual
termination of that transaction were misleading and deficient in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint, which seeks class certification and unspecified damages, was filed in
federal court in Maryland. The complaint was amended, among other things, to add three new named plaintiffs and to name Peter M. Carlino, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and William J. Clifford,
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as additional defendants. We filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in November 2008, and the court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint
with prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied on October 21, 2009. The plaintiffs have appealed the decision and the parties are in the process of filing
appellate briefs.

On
September 11, 2008, the Board of County Commissioners of Cherokee County, Kansas (the "County") filed suit against Kansas Penn Gaming, LLC ("KPG," a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Penn created to pursue a development project in Cherokee County, Kansas) and us in the District Court of Shawnee County, Kansas. The petition alleges that KPG breached its
pre-development agreement with the County when KPG withdrew its application to manage a lottery gaming facility in Cherokee County and seeks in excess of $50 million in damages. In
connection with their petition, the County obtained an ex-parte order attaching the $25 million privilege fee paid to the Kansas Lottery Commission in conjunction with the gaming
application for the Cherokee County zone. The defendants have filed motions to dissolve and reduce the attachment. Those motions were denied and the defendants appealed those decisions to the
appellate court. The Kansas appellate court declined to hear the appeal on jurisdictional grounds and the defendants have requested that the Kansas Supreme Court review that decision.

On
September 23, 2008, KPG filed an action against HV Properties of Kansas, LLC ("HV") in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas seeking a declaratory judgment
from the U.S. District Court finding that KPG has no further obligations to HV under a Real Estate Sale Contract (the "Contract") that KPG and HV entered into on September 6, 2007, and that KPG
properly terminated this Contract under the terms of the Repurchase Agreement entered into between the parties effective September 28, 2007. HV filed a counterclaim claiming KPG breached the
Contract, and seeks $37.5 million in damages. On October 7, 2008, HV filed suit against us claiming we are liable to HV for KPG's alleged breach based on a Guaranty Agreement signed by
us. Both cases were consolidated. We have filed a motion to dismiss HV's claims, which was denied on May 6, 2009. Discovery has concluded and dispositive motions are currently being briefed by
both sides.

In
conjunction with the opening of the new casino riverboat at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge for the
replaced Lawrenceburg vessel of $11.9 million ($7.1 million, net of taxes) during the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, as a result of the anticipated impact of gaming
expansion in Ohio, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $520.5 million ($368.8 million, net of taxes) during the year ended December 31, 2009, as we determined
that a portion of the value of our goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets associated with the original purchase of Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg was impaired.

(2)

As
a result of a decline in our share price, an overall reduction in industry valuations, and property operating performance in the then-current
economic environment, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $481.3 million ($392.6 million, net of taxes) during the year ended December 31, 2008, as we
determined that a portion of the value of our goodwill, indefinite-life intangible assets and long-lived



assets
was impaired. The December 31, 2008 impairment charge by property was as follows: Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, $214.1 million pre-tax ($189.3 million, net of
taxes); Hollywood Casino Aurora, $43.7 million pre-tax and net of taxes; Empress Casino Hotel, $94.4 million pre-tax ($60.4 million, net of taxes); Argosy
Casino Alton, $14.1 million pre-tax and net of taxes; Bullwhackers, $14.2 million pre-tax ($9.1 million, net of taxes); Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway,
$82.7 million pre-tax ($64.0 million, net of taxes); and Corporate overhead, $18.1 million pre-tax ($12.0 million, net of taxes).

During
the year ended December 31, 2006, as a result of the increased asset values resulting from the reconstruction at Hollywood Casino Bay
St. Louis, we determined that all of the goodwill associated with the original purchase of the property was impaired. Accordingly, we recorded a pre-tax charge of
$34.5 million ($22.0 million, net of taxes).

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our Operations

We are a leading, diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and pari-mutuel properties. We currently
own or manage nineteen facilities in fifteen jurisdictions, including Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
West Virginia, and Ontario. We believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with a diversified cash flow from operations.

We
have made significant acquisitions in the past, and expect to continue to pursue additional acquisition and development opportunities in the future. In 1997, we began our transition
from a pari-mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the Charles Town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in West Virginia. Since 1997,
we have continued to expand our gaming operations through strategic acquisitions (including the acquisitions of Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis and Boomtown Biloxi, CRC Holdings, Inc.,
the Bullwhackers properties, Hollywood Casino Corporation, Argosy Gaming Company, Black Gold Casino at Zia Park, and Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club), greenfield projects (such as at Hollywood Casino at
Penn National Race Course and Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway) and property expansions (such as at Charles Town Entertainment Complex and Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg).

The
vast majority of our revenues is gaming revenue, derived primarily from gaming on slot machines and, to a lesser extent, table games. Other revenues are derived from our management
service fee from Casino Rama, our hotel, dining, retail, admissions, program sales, concessions and certain other ancillary activities, and our racing operations. Our racing revenue includes our share
of pari-mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers, our share of wagering from import and export simulcasting, and our share of wagering from our
off-track wagering facilities ("OTWs").

We
intend to continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties and the continued pursuit of
strategic acquisitions and the development of gaming properties, particularly in attractive regional markets. Current capital projects are ongoing at several of our existing properties, including
Empress Casino Hotel, Charles Town Entertainment Complex, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, and Hollywood Casino Perryville, as well as at our proposed facilities in Kansas and Ohio.

Key
performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot handle (volume indicator), table game drop (volume indicator) and "win" or "hold" percentages. Our typical property slot win
percentage is in the range of 6% to 10% of slot handle, and our typical table game win percentage is in the range of 15% to 25% of table game drop.

Our
properties generate significant operating cash flow, since most of our revenue is cash-based from slot machines and pari-mutuel wagering. Our business is
capital intensive, and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to repay debt, fund capital maintenance expenditures, fund new capital projects at existing properties and
provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions.

Merger Announcement and Termination

On June 15, 2007, we announced that we had entered into a merger agreement that, at the effective time of the transactions
contemplated thereby, would have resulted in our shareholders receiving $67.00 per share. Specifically, we, PNG Acquisition Company Inc. ("Parent") and PNG Merger Sub Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), announced that we had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 15, 2007 (the "Merger Agreement"), that provided, among
other things, for Merger Sub to be merged with and into us, as a result of which we would have continued as the surviving corporation and would have become a wholly-owned subsidiary



of
Parent. Parent is indirectly owned by certain funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group LLC ("Fortress") and Centerbridge Partners, L.P. ("Centerbridge").

On
July 3, 2008, we entered into an agreement with certain affiliates of Fortress and Centerbridge, terminating the Merger Agreement. In connection with the termination of the
Merger Agreement, we agreed to receive a total of $1.475 billion, consisting of a nonrefundable $225 million cash termination fee (the "Cash Termination Fee") and a $1.25 billion,
zero coupon, preferred equity investment (the "Investment"). On October 30, 2008, we closed the sale of the Investment and issued 12,500 shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock
(the "Preferred Stock").

Executive Summary

Factors affecting our results for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008,
included the impairment losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009, the fire at Empress Casino Hotel, the loss on early extinguishment of debt, decreases in consumer spending on
gaming activities caused by current economic conditions, competitive pressures at some of our properties, the continued impact of the opening of the casino at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race
Course and the permanent facility at Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway, decreased lobbying expenses, the merger termination settlement fees, net of related expenses, received in 2008, increased
depreciation and amortization expense, decreased interest expense, a change in income taxes, and foreign currency translation losses.

Financial Highlights:

•

Net revenues decreased by $53.8 million, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to decreases in consumer spending on gaming activities caused by current economic conditions, competitive pressures at some of our properties and the
fire at Empress Casino Hotel. These decreases were partially offset by increases in net revenues due to the continued impact of the opening of the casino at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race
Course and the permanent facility at Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway.

•

In conjunction with the opening of the new casino riverboat at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, we recorded a
pre-tax impairment charge for the replaced Lawrenceburg vessel of $11.9 million ($7.1 million, net of taxes) during the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, as a
result of the anticipated impact of gaming expansion in Ohio, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $520.5 million ($368.8 million, net of taxes) during the year ended
December 31, 2009, as we determined that a portion of the value of our goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets associated with the original purchase of Hollywood Casino
Lawrenceburg was impaired.

•

As a result of the Empress Casino Hotel fire, we recorded a $6.1 million pre-tax loss during the year
ended December 31, 2009 for the insurance deductibles for property damage, business interruption and employee lost wages, as well as a write-off of construction fees related to the
renovation that are not recoverable under our insurance policies.

•

Loss from operations increased by $108.2 million, or 125.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2009, as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to a decrease in net revenues, an increase in impairment losses, the fire at Empress Casino Hotel, and an increase in depreciation
and amortization expense, all of which were partially offset by a decrease in gaming expense and general and administrative expense.

•

As a result of the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility of the senior secured credit
facility and the redemption of our $200 million 6


/


% senior subordinated notes, we recorded a $4.8 million pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt during
the year ended December 31, 2009 for the write-off of deferred financing fees related to the Term Loan A Facility and the $200 million 6


/


% senior
subordinated notes.



•

Net loss attributable to the shareholders of Penn National Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries changed by
$111.6 million, or 72.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to the variances explained above, the merger
termination settlement fees, net of related expenses, received in 2008, all of which were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense, a change in income taxes, and foreign currency translation
losses.

Other Developments:

•

In February 2010, Kansas Entertainment, LLC ("Kansas Entertainment") received the final approval under the Kansas
Expanded Lottery Act, along with its gaming license from the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission, to proceed with the development of a Hollywood-themed destination facility overlooking Turn 2 at
Kansas Speedway. In December 2009, Kansas Entertainment was selected by the Kansas Lottery Gaming Facility Review Board to develop and operate a facility in the North East Gaming Zone in Wyandotte
County, Kansas. Kansas Entertainment will begin construction of the facility in the second half of 2010 with a planned opening in early 2012. The $410 million facility, inclusive of licensing
fees, is expected to feature a 100,000 square foot casino with capacity for 2,300 slot machines, 61 table games and 25 poker tables, a 1,500 parking structure, as well as a variety of dining and
entertainment amenities. In September 2009, we entered into an agreement, subject to local and regulatory approvals and certain other closing conditions, with principals of The Cordish Company
("Cordish"), the managing member of Kansas Entertainment, wherein we agreed to acquire Cordish's 50% interest in Kansas Entertainment and to assume their role as managing member. As a result of the
agreement with Cordish, we joined Kansas Speedway Development Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of International Speedway Corporation (which owns the other 50% of Kansas Entertainment) in its
application with the Kansas Lottery Commission to develop and operate a Hollywood-themed destination facility overlooking Turn 2 at Kansas Speedway in the North East Gaming Zone in Wyandotte County,
Kansas. We and International Speedway Corporation will share equally the cost of developing and constructing the proposed facility, and intend to jointly seek third party financing for the project. If
such third party financing cannot be obtained on satisfactory terms, we and International Speedway Corporation are prepared to finance the project. We estimate that our share of the project will be
approximately $155 million. In accordance with the agreement, $25.0 million was placed in escrow until certain conditions in our agreement with Cordish are satisfied. In addition, in
September 2009, as a result of our agreement with Cordish, we withdrew our license application with the Kansas Lottery Commission to be considered as a Lottery Gaming Facility Manager at another site
in Wyandotte County.

•

In February 2010, we completed the purchase of the 123-acre site of the former Delphi Automotive plant in
Columbus's West Side as an alternate location for our planned development of Hollywood Casino Columbus. In January 2010, we purchased the approximately 18-acre location approved as part of
the amendment to Ohio's Constitution in Columbus's Arena District. However, we agreed to consider alternate sites at the request of public officials and others in the Columbus community. In January
2010, the Ohio Legislature approved the language for a Constitutional amendment changing the designated casino location in Columbus to the Delphi site. The location of the Columbus casino will now be
determined in a statewide election in May 2010. Due to the uncertainty of the outcome in the legislature and at the ballot, we are pursuing development at both Columbus sites simultaneously. Plans are
currently being developed for a $400 million Hollywood-themed casino in Columbus, Ohio, inclusive of $50 million in licensing fees. Hollywood Casino Columbus is expected to feature a
180,000 square foot casino, up to 4,000 slot machines, 100 table games and 25 poker tables, a 4,000 parking space garage, as well as food and beverage outlets and an entertainment lounge. Hollywood
Casino Columbus is estimated to be completed in the second half of 2012. In December 2009, we announced that we had completed the purchase of a 44-acre site in Toledo,



Ohio
that was expressly authorized for casino gaming as part of the amendment to Ohio's Constitution. Plans are also currently being developed for a $300 million Hollywood-themed casino in
Toledo, Ohio, inclusive of $50 million in licensing fees. Hollywood Casino Toledo is expected to feature a 125,000 square foot casino, up to 3,000 slot machines, 80 table games and 20 poker
tables, a 2,500 parking space garage, as well as food and beverage outlets and an entertainment lounge. Hollywood Casino
Toledo is estimated to be completed in the second half of 2012. In November 2009, the "Ohio Jobs and Growth Plan," a casino ballot proposal calling for an amendment to Ohio's Constitution to authorize
casinos in the state's four largest cities, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo, was approved. Also, in November 2009, we entered into an agreement with Lakes Entertainment, Inc.
("Lakes"), permitting Lakes to invest in up to a 10% equity interest in each of our proposed facilities in Columbus and Toledo, Ohio.

•

In January 2010, the Pennsylvania legislature passed legislation permitting table games for gaming licensees. We intend to
install table games at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course in two phases. Phase I includes the addition of an estimated 40 table games and 12 poker tables within the existing
facility, and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2010.

•

In December 2009, we announced that we intend to install table games at Charles Town Entertainment Complex following voter
approval of table games in the December 5, 2009 special election. Plans currently include the estimated addition of 85 table games and 27 poker tables, a high-end steakhouse/lounge,
and a Hollywood on the Roof entertainment lounge. The table games, poker tables and the entertainment lounge are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2010, and the high-end
steakhouse/lounge is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2010.

•

In October 2009, the Maryland Video Lottery Facility Location Commission selected us to develop and manage a video lottery
terminal facility in Cecil County, Maryland. Following our selection, we exercised our option and completed the purchase of approximately 36 acres of land located in Perryville, Maryland, and
commenced construction of a $97.5 million Hollywood-themed facility, inclusive of licensing fees of $9.0 million. The new facility will feature 75,000 square feet of gaming space, 1,500
video lottery terminals, food and beverage offerings, and parking for over 1,600 vehicles. The facility is expected to open to the public in late 2010.

•

In September 2009, we amended our senior secured credit facility, in order to increase the borrowing capacity and to
extend the term under the revolving credit facility portion of the senior secured credit facility. Under the new revolving credit facility, two tranches were created, one for those participants who
agreed to extend and one for those that did not extend. Tranche A Revolving Loans consist of available borrowings of $359.4 million, which are due on the original maturity date of
October 3, 2010, and Tranche B Revolving Loans consist of available borrowings of $640.6 million, which are due on July 3, 2012, for a total borrowing capacity of
$1 billion. In addition, in September 2009, we repaid all of the remaining outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility of the senior secured credit facility, using drawings under the
new revolving credit facility. We recorded a $2.4 million loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2009 for the write-off of deferred financing
fees related to the Term Loan A Facility.

•

In August 2009, we completed an offering of $325 million 8


/


% senior subordinated notes that mature
on August 15, 2019. Interest on the $325 million 8


/


% senior subordinated notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning
February 15, 2010. The $325 million 8


/


% senior subordinated notes are general unsecured obligations and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries. The $325 million


/


% senior subordinated notes were issued in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A portion of
the proceeds from the offering were used to repay $40 million of borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility, $70 million of borrowings



under
the Term Loan B Facility, and all outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the time. The remainder of the proceeds, plus available cash, was used to pay the validly-tendered
principal amounts of our $200 million 6


/


% senior subordinated notes.

•

In August 2009, we called for the redemption of our $200 million 6


/


% senior subordinated notes.
The redemption price was $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which was paid in September 2009. Approximately $94.5 million aggregate principal amount of the


/


% senior subordinated notes were validly tendered and paid. In October 2009, we called for the redemption of all of the $105.5 million outstanding aggregate principal amount
of our 6


/


% senior subordinated notes. The redemption price was $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In December 2009, we repaid all of the
$105.5 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 6


/


% senior subordinated notes. We recorded a $2.4 million loss on early extinguishment of debt during the
year ended December 31, 2009 for the write-off of the deferred financing fees related to the $200 million 6


/


% senior subordinated notes. We funded the
$94.5 million redemption from a portion of the proceeds from the offering of $325 million 8


/


% senior subordinated notes and available cash and funded the
$105.5 million redemption using drawings under our revolving credit facility.

In late June 2009, the new casino riverboat at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg officially opened, replacing the vessel at
Argosy Casino Lawrenceburg. The new Hollywood-themed casino riverboat offers 3,225 slot machines, 88 live table games, 41 poker tables, and new food and beverage offerings, as well as expanded parking
and infrastructure improvements, which will make the facility more accessible. In conjunction with the opening of the new casino riverboat at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, we recorded a
pre-tax impairment charge for the replaced Lawrenceburg vessel of $11.9 million ($7.1 million, net of taxes) during the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, as a
result of the anticipated impact of gaming expansion in Ohio, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $520.5 million ($368.8 million, net of taxes) during the year ended
December 31, 2009, as we determined that a portion of the value of our goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets associated with the original purchase of Hollywood Casino
Lawrenceburg was impaired.

•

On March 20, 2009, Empress Casino Hotel, which was undergoing a $55 million renovation, was closed following
a fire that started in the land-based pavilion at the facility. All customers and employees were successfully evacuated, and the fire was contained on the land-side of the
property before it could spread to the adjacent casino barge. On June 25, 2009, the casino barge was reopened with temporary land-based facilities, and we began construction of a
new land-based pavilion. We carry a builders' risk insurance policy for the on-going renovations with a policy limit of $57 million, inclusive of $14 million for
delay in completion and $43 million for property damage. The builders' risk insurance policy includes a $50,000 property damage deductible and a 30-day delay in completion
deductible for the peril of fire. In addition, we carry comprehensive business interruption and property damage insurance for the operational components of the Empress Casino Hotel with an overall
limit of $228 million. The operational insurance policy includes a $2.5 million property damage deductible and a 48-hour business interruption deductible for the peril of
fire. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a $6.1 million pre-tax loss for the insurance deductibles for property damage, business interruption and employee
lost wages, as well as a write-off of construction fees related to the renovation that are not recoverable under the Company's insurance policies. During the year ended December 31,
2009, we received $20.6 million in insurance proceeds related to the fire at Empress Casino Hotel.

•

In March 2009, the Rights Agreement providing for the dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right for each
outstanding share of our Common Stock that our Board of Directors authorized and declared on May 20, 1998 expired.



•

In March 2009, we entered into the Third Amendment to the October 14, 2004 Purchase Agreement, that had been
entered into with the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority ("MTGA") for the sale of The Downs Racing, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Purchase Agreement"). In August 2006, we had entered into the
Second Amendment to the Purchase Agreement and Release of Claims, in which we agreed to pay the MTGA an aggregate of $30 million over five years, in exchange for the MTGA's agreement to release
various claims it raised against us under the Purchase Agreement and the MTGA's surrender of all post-closing termination rights it might have had under the Purchase Agreement. The Third
Amendment to the Purchase Agreement accelerated and reduced the remaining payments due by us under the Purchase Agreement. In exchange for the accelerated payment, which was paid to the MTGA in March
2009, all remaining obligations under the Purchase Agreement were deemed to be satisfied and, as a result, we recorded a $1.3 million gain during the year ended December 31, 2009, which
is included in other income within the consolidated statements of operations.

•

Current capital projects are ongoing at several of our existing properties, including Empress Casino Hotel, Charles Town
Entertainment Complex, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, and Hollywood Casino Perryville, as well as at our proposed facilities in Kansas and Ohio. Additional information regarding our
capital projects is discussed in detail in the section entitled "Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditures" below.

Critical Accounting Policies

We make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements. The nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the
susceptibility of such factors to change. We have identified the policies related to the accounting for long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes and
litigation, claims and assessments as critical accounting policies, which require us to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions.

We
believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience
differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

The
development and selection of the critical accounting policies, and the related disclosures, have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Long-lived assets

At December 31, 2009, we had a net property and equipment balance of $1,837.5 million within our consolidated balance
sheet, representing 39.0% of total assets. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are determined based
on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy. We review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered
by us in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. In estimating
expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired, assets are grouped at the individual property level. In assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and
equipment, we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment loss
for



these
assets. Such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non-cash component of operating income.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

At December 31, 2009, we had $1,380.0 million in goodwill and $377.0 million in other intangible assets within our
consolidated balance sheet, representing 29.3% and 8.0% of total assets, respectively, resulting from our acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses and racing permits. Two issues
arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment: (i) the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation; and (ii) the
ongoing evaluation for impairment.

In
connection with our acquisitions, valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices. The factors considered in the valuations include data gathered as a
result of our due diligence in connection with the acquisitions, projections for future operations, and data obtained from third-party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate. Goodwill is tested
annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, an impairment test is performed to determine the implied value of goodwill for that reporting unit. If the implied value is less than the carrying amount for that reporting
unit, an impairment loss is recognized for that reporting unit. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill
and Other," we consider our gaming license, racing permit and trademark intangible assets as indefinite-life intangible assets
that do not require amortization. Rather, these intangible assets are tested annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded
assets to their carrying amount. If the carrying amounts of the gaming license, racing permit and trademark intangible assets exceed their fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The evaluation
of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value. We use a
market approach model, which includes the use of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, charges for stock compensation, depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on disposal of assets, and certain
other income and expenses, and inclusive of loss from joint venture) multiples, as we believe that EBITDA is a widely-used measure of performance in the gaming industry and as we use
EBITDA as the primary measurement of the operating performance of our properties (including the evaluation of operating personnel). In addition, we believe that an EBITDA multiple is the principal
basis for the valuation of gaming companies. Changes in the estimated EBITDA multiple or forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates. Once an impairment of goodwill or other
indefinite-life intangible assets has been recorded, it cannot be reversed. Because our goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets are not amortized, there may be
volatility in reported income because impairment losses, if any, are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts. Intangible assets that have a definite-life, including the
management service contract for Casino Rama, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or related service contract. We review the carrying value of our
intangible assets that have a definite-life for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying
amount of the intangible assets that have a definite-life exceed their fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.

Income taxes

At December 31, 2009, we had a net deferred tax liability balance of $103.5 million within our consolidated balance
sheet. We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes" ("ASC 740"). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these
differences are settled or realized. ASC 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a



valuation
allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance, if necessary. The factors used to
assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. We have used
tax-planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits.

ASC 740
also creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions, and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial
statements by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. It also provides guidance on
derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. At December 31, 2009, we had a liability for unrecognized tax
benefits of $46.7 million, which is included in noncurrent tax liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet. We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in
each jurisdiction. These audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve. In our opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods.

Litigation, claims and assessments

We utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. These estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding
current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. If our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimate, which may have an adverse effect on our
results of operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Results of Operations

The following are the most important factors and trends that contribute to our operating performance:

•

The fact that most of our properties operate in mature competitive markets. As a result, we expect a majority of our
future growth to come from prudent acquisitions of gaming properties, jurisdictional expansions (such as the property openings in Pennsylvania and Maine, as well as the anticipated openings in
Maryland, Kansas and Ohio) and expansions/improvements of existing properties.

•

The actions of government bodies can affect our operations in a variety of ways. For instance, the continued pressure on
governments to balance their budgets could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes. In addition, government bodies may restrict,
prevent or negatively impact operations in the jurisdictions in which we do business (such as the Illinois, Colorado and Pennsylvania smoking bans that became effective on January 1, 2008).

•

The fact that a number of states are currently considering or implementing legislation to legalize or expand gaming. Such
legislation presents both potential opportunities to establish new properties (for instance, in Kansas, Ohio and Maryland) and potential competitive threats to business at our existing properties
(such as the potential introduction of commercial casinos in Kansas, Maryland, Ohio, and Kentucky, an additional gaming license in Illinois, and the introduction of tavern licenses in several states).
We also face uncertainty regarding anticipated gaming expansion by one of our competitors in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Legalized gaming from Native American casinos can also have a significant
competitive effect.

•

The continued demand for, and our emphasis on, slot wagering entertainment at our properties.



•

The closing of Empress Casino Hotel from March 20, 2009 until June 25, 2009 due to a fire, and the timing of
the recognition of insurance proceeds relating to the insurance claim.

•

The successful execution of the development and construction activities currently underway at a number of our facilities,
as well as the risks associated with the costs, regulatory approval and the timing for these activities.

•

The risks related to economic conditions and the effect of such conditions on consumer spending for leisure and gaming
activities, which may negatively impact our operating results and our ability to access financing.

and administrative expense at Empress Casino Hotel decreased by $4.2 million in 2009, as the property was closed from March 20, 2009 until June 25, 2009 due
to a fire.

General
and administrative expense at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course increased by $5.0 million in 2009, primarily due to increased payroll costs and an increase in
real estate taxes due to the property reassessments that were effective in April 2009.

2008 Compared with 2007

General and administrative expense increased by $45.4 million, or 12.3%, to $415.1 million in 2008, primarily due to an
increase in corporate overhead expense and the opening of the casino at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, both of which were partially offset by a decrease at Argosy Casino Alton.

Corporate
overhead expense increased by $38.7 million in 2008, primarily due to increased lobbying expenses, for efforts primarily in Ohio, Maryland and Maine, and separation
payments to Leonard DeAngelo, both of which were partially offset by no EBITDA-based bonuses being paid to corporate employees in 2008.

General
and administrative expense at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course increased by $11.2 million in 2008, as the casino opened on February 12, 2008.

General
and administrative expense at Argosy Casino Alton decreased by $4.2 million in 2008, primarily due to cost reduction measures.

Impairment losses


In conjunction with the opening of the new casino riverboat at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, we recorded a pre-tax
impairment charge for the replaced Lawrenceburg vessel of $11.9 million ($7.1 million, net of taxes) during the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, as a result of the
anticipated impact of gaming expansion in Ohio, we recorded a
pre-tax impairment charge of $520.5 million ($368.8 million, net of taxes) during the year ended December 31, 2009, as we determined that a portion of the value of our
goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets associated with the original purchase of Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg was impaired.


As a result of a decline in our share price, an overall reduction in industry valuations, and property operating performance in the
then-current economic environment, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $481.3 million ($392.6 million, net of taxes) during the year ended
December 31, 2008, as we



determined
that a portion of the value of our goodwill, indefinite-life intangible assets and long-lived assets was impaired. The impairment charge by property was as follows:
Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, $214.1 million pre-tax ($189.3 million, net of taxes); Hollywood Casino Aurora, $43.7 million pre-tax and net of taxes;
Empress Casino Hotel, $94.4 million pre-tax ($60.4 million, net of taxes); Argosy Casino Alton, $14.1 million pre-tax and net of taxes; Bullwhackers,
$14.2 million pre-tax ($9.1 million, net of taxes); Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway, $82.7 million pre-tax ($64.0 million, net of taxes); and
Corporate overhead, $18.1 million pre-tax ($12.0 million, net of taxes).

Empress Casino Hotel fire

As a result of the Empress Casino Hotel fire, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a $6.1 million
pre-tax loss for the insurance deductibles for property damage, business interruption and employee lost wages, as well as a write-off of construction fees related to the
renovation that are not recoverable under our insurance policies.

Depreciation and amortization expense

2009 Compared to 2008

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $20.9 million, or 12.0%, to $194.4 million in 2009, primarily due to
increases at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, and Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway, all of which were partially offset by decreases at Argosy Casino
Riverside, Empress Casino Hotel, and corporate overhead.

Depreciation
and amortization expense at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course increased by $13.3 million in 2009, primarily due to incremental depreciation expense being
recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009 and the continued impact of the opening of the casino on February 12, 2008.

Depreciation
and amortization expense at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg increased by $9.9 million in 2009, primarily due to the opening of the new casino riverboat in late June
2009.

Depreciation
and amortization expense at Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway increased by $5.9 million in 2009, primarily due to the continued impact of the opening of the permanent
facility on July 1, 2008.

Depreciation
and amortization expense at Argosy Casino Riverside decreased by $3.2 million in 2009, primarily due to a large volume of equipment related to the casino expansion
completed in December 2003 now being fully depreciated.

Depreciation
and amortization expense at Empress Casino Hotel decreased by $2.8 million in 2009, as the property was closed from March 20, 2009 until June 25, 2009
due to a fire.

Depreciation
and amortization expense for corporate overhead decreased by $0.9 million in 2009, primarily due to certain intangible assets now being fully amortized.

2008 Compared with 2007

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $25.6 million, or 17.3%, to $173.5 million in 2008, primarily due to
the opening of the casino at Hollywood Casino at
Penn National Race Course and the opening of the permanent facility at Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway.

Depreciation
and amortization expense at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course increased by $21.2 million in 2008, as the casino opened on February 12, 2008.

Depreciation
and amortization expense at Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway increased by $3.8 million in 2008, primarily due to the opening of the permanent facility on
July 1, 2008.

Interest expense

Interest expense decreased by $34.8 million, or 20.5%, to $135.0 million in 2009, primarily due to lower outstanding
balances and lower interest rates on our senior secured credit facility, which was partially offset by increased interest expense resulting from interest rate swaps due to the drop in variable rates,
lower capitalized interest during the year ended December 31, 2009 and incremental interest expense due to the issuance of the $325 million 8

% senior
subordinated notes in August 2009.

Interest
expense decreased by $28.2 million, or 14.3%, to $169.8 million in 2008, primarily due to lower outstanding balances and lower interest rates on our senior secured
credit facility, which was partially offset by increased interest expense resulting from payments related to interest rate swaps in 2008.

Interest income

Interest income increased by $4.3 million, or 108.2%, to $8.4 million in 2008, primarily due to interest earned on the
investment in corporate securities in 2008, as well as the original issue discount amortization.

Merger termination settlement fees, net of related expenses

Merger termination settlement fees, net of related expenses, include the Cash Termination Fee of $225 million, partially offset
by $29.6 million in costs incurred for the termination of the Merger.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt

We recorded a $4.8 million loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2009, as a result of
the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan A



Facility
of the senior secured credit facility and the redemption of our $200 million 6

extinguishment of debt of $4.8 million for the write-off of deferred financing fees related to the Term Loan A Facility and the $200 million 6

subordinated notes.

Other

Other decreased by $5.3 million, or 83.0%, to $1.1 million in 2009, primarily due to foreign currency translation losses
that were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009, which was partially offset by the gain on the sale of the investment in corporate debt securities.

Other
increased by $17.8 million, or 156.2%, to $6.4 million in 2008, primarily due to foreign currency translation gains that were recorded during the year ended
December 31, 2008, which was partially offset by the write-off of costs incurred to procure licenses to manage gaming facilities in Kansas.

Taxes

The decrease in our effective tax rate (income taxes as a percentage of income from operations before taxes) to 18.4% for the year
ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 222.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008, is primarily as a result of lower earnings, a change in the geographic mix of earnings and benefits
related to favorable resolutions of certain tax settlements, all of which were partially offset by an increase in the rate due to the non-deductible portion of our goodwill impairment
charges.

The
increase in our effective tax rate to 222.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 45.2% for the year ended December 31, 2007, is primarily a result of
the nondeductible portion of the impairment loss related to goodwill and nondeductible lobbying expenses.

Our
effective income tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings and the level of our tax credits. Certain
of these and other factors, including our history of pre-tax earnings, are taken into account in assessing our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets. We expect our effective tax
rate to normalize for the year ending December 31, 2010.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been cash flow from operations, borrowings from banks and
proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities.

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $338.2 million, $420.5 million and $431.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 included non-cash reconciling items, such as depreciation, amortization, the charge for
stock compensation, the loss relating to the early extinguishment of debt, the Empress Casino Hotel fire insurance loss, the gain on sale of investment in corporate debt securities, and impairment
losses, of $623.0 million, partially offset by net loss including noncontrolling interests of $267.4 million and net changes in asset and liability accounts of $17.4 million.

Net
cash used in investing activities totaled $262.7 million, $391.5 million and $611.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 included expenditures for property and equipment and license fees totaling $289.6 million and
$9.0 million, respectively, investment in Kansas Entertainment of $12.9 million, increase in cash in escrow of $25.0 million, all of which were partially offset by proceeds from
the sale of property and equipment, the sale of investment in corporate debt securities and insurance proceeds received as a result of the Empress Casino Hotel fire totaling $2.6 million,
$50.6 million and $20.6 million, respectively.



Net
cash (used in) provided by financing activities totaled ($108.8) million, $542.9 million and $186.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Net cash used in
financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 included principal payments on long-term debt and payments on insurance financing totaling $879.2 million and
$16.8 million, respectively, and an increase in deferred financing fees of $22.9 million. All of these were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling
$5.4 million, the tax benefit from stock options exercised totaling $2.4 million, contributions from noncontrolling interests of $1.9 million, and proceeds from the issuance of
long-term debt and insurance financing of $784.9 million and $15.5 million, respectively.

On
July 3, 2008, we entered into an agreement with certain affiliates of Fortress and Centerbridge, terminating the Merger Agreement. In connection with the termination of the
Merger Agreement, we agreed to receive a total of $1.475 billion, consisting of the Cash Termination Fee and the Investment. On October 30, 2008, we closed the sale of the Investment and
issued 12,500 shares of our Preferred Stock.

We
used a portion of the net proceeds from the Investment and the after-tax proceeds of the Cash Termination Fee for the repayment of some of our existing debt, repurchases
of our Common Stock, lobbying expenses for efforts in Ohio and investment in corporate debt securities, with the remainder being invested primarily in short-term securities. The repurchase
of up to $200 million of our Common Stock over the twenty-four month period ending July 2010 was authorized by our Board of Directors in July 2008. During the year ended
December 31, 2009, we did not repurchase any shares of our Common Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 8,934,984 shares of our Common Stock in open market
transactions for approximately $152.6 million, at an average price of $17.05.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures are accounted for as either capital project or capital maintenance (replacement) expenditures. Capital project
expenditures are for fixed asset additions that expand an existing facility or create a new facility. Capital maintenance expenditures are expenditures to replace existing fixed assets with a useful
life greater than one year that are obsolete, worn out or no longer cost effective to repair.

The
Hollywood-themed expansion at Lawrenceburg includes the addition of 1,500 parking spaces and 1,168 gaming positions, as well as enhanced amenities and a
floor layout that will better facilitate customer flow. The garage and pedestrian walkway opened in May 2008 and the gaming facility opened in June 2009. Meeting space for Hollywood
Casino Lawrenceburg partially opened in December 2009 and will be completed in the first quarter of 2010, a new steakhouse/lounge is scheduled for completion



in
the second quarter of 2010, and a new mid-priced restaurant is scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 2010.

At
Empress Casino Hotel, we started the facility enhancements in late 2008. On March 20, 2009, Empress Casino Hotel, which was undergoing a $55 million renovation, was
closed following a fire that started in the land-based pavilion at the facility. All customers and employees were successfully evacuated, and the fire was contained on the
land-side of the property before it could spread to the adjacent casino barge. On June 25, 2009, the casino barge was reopened with temporary land-based facilities, and
we began construction of a new land-based pavilion. Construction on a new 1,100 space parking garage was completed in the first quarter of 2010. The permanent land-based
pavilion is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2010 and upgrades to the gaming vessel and other areas are expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2011.

In
Cecil County, Maryland, following our selection by the Maryland Video Lottery Facility Location Commission to develop and manage a video lottery terminal facility, we exercised our
option and completed the purchase of approximately 36 acres of land located in Perryville, Maryland, and commenced construction of a $97.5 million Hollywood-themed facility,
inclusive of licensing fees of $9.0 million. The new facility will feature 75,000 square feet of gaming space, 1,500 video lottery terminals, food and beverage offerings, and
parking for over 1,600 vehicles. The facility is expected to open to the public in late 2010.

In
January 2010, the Pennsylvania legislature passed legislation permitting table games for gaming licensees. We intend to install table games at Hollywood Casino at Penn National
Race Course in two phases. Phase I includes the addition of an estimated 40 table games and 12 poker tables within the existing facility, and is expected to be completed in the
fourth quarter of 2010.

In
November 2009, the "Ohio Jobs and Growth Plan," a casino ballot proposal calling for an amendment to Ohio's Constitution to authorize casinos in the state's four largest cities,
Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo, was approved. Plans are currently being developed for a $300 million Hollywood-themed casino in Toledo, Ohio, inclusive of
$50 million in licensing fees, and a $400 million Hollywood-themed casino in Columbus, Ohio, inclusive of $50 million in licensing fees. Hollywood Casino Toledo is
expected to feature a 125,000 square foot casino, up to 3,000 slot machines, 80 table games and 20 poker tables, a 2,500 parking space garage, as well as food and beverage
outlets and an entertainment lounge. Hollywood Casino Columbus is expected to feature a 180,000 square foot casino, up to 4,000 slot machines, 100 table games and 25 poker
tables, a 4,000 parking space garage, as well as food and beverage outlets and an entertainment lounge.
Hollywood Casino Toledo and Hollywood Casino Columbus are estimated to be completed in the second half of 2012.

In
February 2010, Kansas Entertainment received the final approval under the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act, along with its gaming license from the Kansas Racing and Gaming
Commission, to proceed with the development of a Hollywood-themed destination facility overlooking Turn 2 at Kansas Speedway. In December 2009, Kansas Entertainment was
selected by the Kansas Lottery Gaming Facility Review Board to develop and operate a facility in the North East Gaming Zone in Wyandotte County, Kansas. Kansas Entertainment will begin construction of
the facility in the second half of 2010 with a planned opening in early 2012. The $410 million Hollywood-themed destination facility, inclusive of licensing fees, is expected
to feature a 100,000 square foot casino with capacity for 2,300 slot machines, 61 table games and 25 poker tables, a 1,500 parking structure, as well as a variety of dining
and entertainment amenities. We and International Speedway Corporation will share equally the cost of developing and constructing the proposed facility. We estimate that our share of the project will
be approximately $155 million.

In
December 2009, we announced that we intend to install table games at Charles Town Entertainment Complex following voter approval of table games in the December 5, 2009
special election. Plans currently include the estimated addition of 85 table games and 27 poker tables, a high-end steakhouse/lounge, and a Hollywood on the Roof
entertainment lounge. The table games, poker tables and the entertainment lounge are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2010, and the high-end steakhouse/lounge is expected
to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2010.



During the year ended December 31, 2009, we spent approximately $80.6 million for capital maintenance expenditures at our properties. The majority
of the capital maintenance expenditures were for slot machines and slot machine equipment.

Cash
generated from operations and cash available under the revolver portion of our senior secured credit facility have funded our capital project and capital maintenance expenditures in
2009.

Debt

Senior Secured Credit Facility

The senior secured credit facility historically consisted of three credit facilities comprised of a $750 million revolving
credit facility with a maturity date of October 3, 2010, a $325 million Term Loan A Facility with a maturity date of October 3, 2011 and a $1.65 billion Term
Loan B Facility with a maturity date of October 3, 2012. In September 2009, we amended our senior secured credit facility, in order to increase the borrowing capacity and to
extend the term under the revolving credit facility portion of the senior secured credit facility. Under the new revolving credit facility, two tranches were created, one for those participants who
agreed to extend and one for those that did not extend. Tranche A Revolving Loans consist of available borrowings of $359.4 million, which are due on the original maturity date of
October 3, 2010, and Tranche B Revolving Loans consist of available borrowings of $640.6 million, which are due on July 3, 2012, for a total borrowing capacity of
$1 billion.

In
August 2009, we repaid $40 million of borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility, $70 million of borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility, and all
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the time, using a portion of the proceeds from the offering of $325 million 8


/


% senior subordinated notes. In
addition, in September 2009, we repaid all of the remaining outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility, using drawings under the new revolving credit facility.

As
of December 31, 2009, $237.5 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility and $1,518.1 million was outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility, for
a total of $1,755.6 million. As of December 31, 2008, $123.7 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility, $239.7 million was outstanding under the Term
Loan A Facility, and $1,596.4 million was outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility, for a total of $1,959.8 million.

We
recorded a $2.4 million loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2009 for the write-off of deferred financing fees related to
the Term Loan A Facility.



During
the year ended December 31, 2009, our senior secured credit facility amount outstanding decreased by $204.2 million, primarily due to the August 2009 repayment of
$40 million of borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility, $70 million of borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility, and all outstanding borrowings under the revolving
credit facility at the time, using a portion of the proceeds from the offering of $325 million 8

Other Long-Term Obligations

On October 15, 2004, we announced the sale of The Downs Racing, Inc. and its subsidiaries to the Mohegan Tribal Gaming
Authority ("MTGA"). Under the terms of the agreement, the MTGA acquired The Downs Racing, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Pocono Downs (a standardbred horse racing facility located on 400
acres in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania) and five Pennsylvania OTWs located in Carbondale, East Stroudsburg, Erie, Hazelton and the Lehigh Valley (Allentown). The sale agreement also provided the MTGA
with certain post-closing termination rights in the event of certain materially adverse legislative or regulatory events. In January 2005, we received $280 million from the MTGA,
and transferred the operations of The Downs Racing, Inc. and its subsidiaries to the MTGA. The sale was not considered final for accounting purposes until the third quarter of 2006, as the MTGA
had certain post-closing termination rights that remained outstanding. On August 7, 2006, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Purchase Agreement and Release of Claims with
the MTGA pertaining to the October 14, 2004 Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), and agreed to pay the MTGA an aggregate of $30 million over five years, beginning on the first
anniversary of the commencement of slot operations at Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs, in exchange for the MTGA's agreement to release various claims it raised against us under the Purchase Agreement and
the MTGA's surrender of all post-closing termination rights it might have had under the Purchase Agreement. We recorded the present value of the $30 million liability within debt,
as the amount due to the MTGA was payable over five years. In March 2009, we entered into the Third Amendment to the Purchase
Agreement, in which the remaining payments due under the Purchase Agreement were accelerated and reduced. Under the Third Amendment to the Purchase Agreement, in exchange for the accelerated payment,
which was paid to the MTGA in March 2009, all remaining obligations under the Purchase Agreement were deemed to be satisfied and, as result, we recorded a $1.3 million gain during the year
ended December 31, 2009, which is included in other income within the consolidated statements of operations.

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, we placed some of the funds received from the issuance of our Preferred Stock into unrestricted subsidiaries, in order to allow for
maximum flexibility in the deployment of the funds. The funds and activity maintained within the unrestricted subsidiaries are excluded from our covenant calculations.

At
December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all required financial covenants.

Outlook

Based on our current level of operations, and anticipated revenue growth, we believe that cash generated from operations and from the
Investment, together with amounts available under our senior secured credit facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs
for the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized, or that future
borrowings will be available under our senior secured credit facility or otherwise will be available to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the senior secured credit facility and the
senior subordinated notes, to retire or redeem the senior subordinated notes when



required
or to make anticipated capital expenditures. In addition, we expect a majority of our future growth to come from acquisitions of gaming properties at reasonable valuations, greenfield
projects, jurisdictional expansions and property expansion in under-penetrated markets. If we consummate significant acquisitions in the future or undertake any significant property expansions, our
cash requirements may increase significantly and we may need to make additional borrowings or complete equity or debt financings to meet these requirements. We may need to refinance all or a portion
of our debt on or before maturity. Our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance our debt will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other
factors, many of which are beyond our control. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Capital Structure" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risk
related to our capital structure.

$4.4 million.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to improve disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance provides amendments to
require new disclosures regarding transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy, and activity in Level 3, and to clarify existing disclosures regarding
the level of disaggregation, inputs and valuation techniques. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the new
disclosures regarding purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted the guidance, except for the new disclosures regarding purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll
forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, as of January 1, 2010, as required. We do not expect that the January 1, 2010 adoption of the guidance will have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are currently determining the impact of the new disclosures regarding purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity
in Level 3 fair value measurements on our consolidated financial statements.

In
January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to address implementation issues related to the changes in ownership provisions in ASC 810, "Consolidation," ("ASC 810"). The
guidance clarifies the scope of the decrease in ownership provisions in ASC 810 and expands the disclosures about the deconsolidation of a
subsidiary or derecognition of a group of assets within the scope of ASC 810. As we previously adopted ASC 810, the guidance is effective beginning in the first interim or annual
reporting period ending on or after December 15, 2009, and should be applied retrospectively to the first period that ASC 810 was adopted by us. We adopted the guidance as of
December 31, 2009, as required. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
September 2009, the FASB issued guidance concerning fair value measurements of investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). The
guidance creates a practical expedient to measure the fair value of an investment that is within the scope of the guidance on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment (or its
equivalent) determined as of the reporting entity's measurement date. Therefore, the guidance allows certain attributes of the



investment,
which in the past may have indicated that it was necessary to make adjustments to the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) to estimate the fair value of the investment, to not be
considered if the practical expedient is used. Additional disclosures are also required under the guidance. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15,
2009, with early application permitted. We adopted the guidance as of December 31, 2009, as required. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
August 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the measurement of liabilities at fair value. The guidance provides clarification in measuring the fair value of liabilities. The guidance is
effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after issuance. We adopted the guidance as of October 1, 2009, as required. This guidance did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued the ASC. The ASC became the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The ASC eliminates the previous United States GAAP hierarchy and establishes one level
of authoritative GAAP. All other literature is considered non-authoritative. The ASC is effective for most financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after
September 15, 2009. We adopted the ASC as of September 30, 2009, as required. The adoption of the ASC did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued amended guidance for variable interest entities. The objective of the amended guidance is to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with
variable interest entities and to provide more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements. The amended guidance is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity's
first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter.
Earlier application is prohibited. We adopted the amended guidance as of January 1, 2010, as required. We do not expect that the adoption of the amended guidance will have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

In
May 2009, the FASB issued guidance on subsequent events. The guidance establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date
but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. In addition, under the guidance, an entity is required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been
evaluated, as well as whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial statements were available to be issued. The guidance does not apply to subsequent
events or transactions that are within the scope of other applicable GAAP that provide different guidance on the accounting treatment for subsequent events or transactions. The guidance is effective
for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009, and shall be applied prospectively. We adopted the guidance as of June 30, 2009, as required. The adoption of the
guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance on subsequent events. The amended guidance removes the requirement
for United States Securities and Exchange Commission filers to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. The amended guidance is effective upon issuance, except for the
use of the issued date for conduit debt obligors. We adopted the amended guidance upon issuance, as required. The adoption of the amended guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In
April 2009, the FASB issued additional requirements regarding disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as
well as in annual financial statements. The new requirements are effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. We adopted the additional requirements as of June 30,
2009, as required. The adoption of the new requirements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance amends the
other-than-temporary impairment



guidance
for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity
securities in the financial statements. The guidance does not amend existing recognition and measurement guidance related to other-than-temporary impairments of equity
securities. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. We adopted the guidance as of June 30, 2009, as required. The adoption of the
guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2009, the FASB issued guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and on identifying
transactions that are not orderly. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, and shall be applied prospectively. We adopted the guidance as
of June 30, 2009, as required. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2009, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies. The guidance
addresses application
issues on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. The guidance is
effective for all assets acquired or liabilities assumed arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting
period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2009, as required. We expect that the adoption of the guidance will have an impact on our
consolidated financial statements, in the event that we acquire companies in the future.

In
April 2008, the FASB issued guidance regarding the determination of the useful life of intangible assets. The guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing
renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2009, as required. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact
on our consolidated financial statements.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued guidance regarding the disclosure of derivative instruments and hedging activities. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures about an entity's derivative
and hedging activities. Specifically, entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about: a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; b) how derivative instruments and
related hedged items are accounted; and c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The guidance is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. The guidance encourages, but does not
require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. We adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2009, as required. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact
on our consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued amended guidance on business combinations. The intention of the amended guidance is to improve reporting by creating greater consistency in the
accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. The amended guidance requires that the acquiring entity in a business combination recognize all (and only) the assets and liabilities
assumed in the transaction, establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and requires the acquirer to disclose
to investors and other users all of the information that they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. In addition, the amended guidance modifies
the accounting for transaction and restructuring costs. The amended guidance is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual
reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted the amended guidance as of January 1, 2009, as required. We expect



that
the adoption of the amended guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, in the event that we acquire companies in the future.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued guidance on fair value measurements. The guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosure
requirements about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB amended the guidance so as to exclude from its
scope certain accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements associated with leases and to delay the effective date of the guidance to fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2008 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). In October 2008, the
FASB issued additional guidance that provides clarification on the application of the guidance on fair value measurements in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key
considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. We adopted the guidance on fair value measurements, as amended, and on a
prospective basis, as of January 1, 2008. The January 1, 2008 adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We adopted the guidance on fair value
measurements, as amended, and on a prospective basis, as of January 1, 2009 to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on a recurring basis. The January 1, 2009 adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The table below provides information at December 31, 2009 about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in
interest rates, including debt obligations and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents notional amounts maturing during the year and the related weighted-average interest rates
at year-end. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted-average interest rates outstanding at each year-end. Notional amounts are used to
calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract and the weighted-average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at December 31, 2009.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board
of Directors

Penn National Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Penn National Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Penn National Gaming, Inc. and
subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Penn National Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.     Business and Basis of Presentation

Penn National Gaming, Inc. ("Penn") and subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") is a diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and
pari-mutuel properties. Penn is the successor to several businesses that have operated as Penn National Race Course since 1972. Penn was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1982 as PNRC Corp.
and adopted its current name in 1994, when the Company became a public company. In 1997, the Company began its transition from a pari-mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with
the acquisition of the Charles Town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in West Virginia. Since 1997, the Company has continued to expand its gaming operations through strategic
acquisitions (including the acquisitions of Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis and Boomtown Biloxi, CRC Holdings, Inc., the Bullwhackers properties, Hollywood Casino Corporation, Argosy
Gaming Company ("Argosy"), Black Gold Casino at Zia Park, and Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club), greenfield projects (such as at Hollywood
Casino at Penn National Race Course and Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway) and property expansions (such as at Charles Town Entertainment Complex and Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg).

The
Company currently owns or manages nineteen facilities in fifteen jurisdictions, including Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New
Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ontario.

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses for the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

For
purposes of comparability, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

2.     Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Penn and its subsidiaries, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and subsidiaries with a
noncontrolling interest. Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates that are 50% owned are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

3.     Merger Announcement and Termination

On June 15, 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into a merger agreement that, at the effective time of the transactions contemplated thereby,
would have resulted in the Company's shareholders receiving $67.00 per share. Specifically, the Company, PNG Acquisition Company Inc. ("Parent") and PNG Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), announced that they had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 15, 2007 (the "Merger Agreement"), that provided, among other things,
for Merger Sub to be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), as a result of which the Company would have continued as the surviving corporation and would have become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent. Parent is indirectly owned by certain funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group LLC ("Fortress") and Centerbridge Partners, L.P. ("Centerbridge").

On
July 3, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with certain affiliates of Fortress and Centerbridge, terminating the Merger Agreement. In connection with the termination
of the Merger Agreement, the Company agreed to receive a total of $1.475 billion, consisting of a nonrefundable $225 million cash termination fee (the "Cash Termination Fee") and a
$1.25 billion, zero coupon, preferred equity investment (the "Investment"). On October 30, 2008, the Company closed the sale of



the
Investment and issued 12,500 shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock").

The
Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the Investment and the after-tax proceeds of the Cash Termination Fee for the repayment of some of its existing debt,
repurchases of its Common Stock, lobbying expenses for efforts in Ohio and investment in corporate debt securities, with the remainder being invested primarily in short-term securities.
The repurchase of up to $200 million of the Company's Common Stock over the twenty-four month period ending July 2010 was authorized by the Company's Board of Directors in July
2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its Common Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 8,934,984
shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions for approximately $152.6 million, at an average price of $17.05.

On
December 26, 2007, the Company entered into a Change in Control Payment Acknowledgement and Agreement (the "Acknowledgement and Agreement") with certain members of its
management team. Pursuant to the Acknowledgement and Agreement, a portion of the payment due on a change in control to such executives was accelerated and paid on or before December 31, 2007.
The Acknowledgement and Agreements were entered into as part of actions taken to reduce the amount of "gross-up" payments pertaining to federal excise taxes that may have otherwise been
owed to such executives under the terms of their existing employment agreements in connection with the change in control payments due upon the consummation of the Merger. The accelerated change in
control payments were subject to a clawback right in the event the Merger was terminated pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement or the closing of the Merger otherwise failed to occur or if the
executive's employment with the Company was terminated prior to the effective date of the Merger under circumstances where the executive was not entitled to receive the remainder of his change in
control payment under the terms of his employment agreement. In July 2008, the Company exercised its clawback right for the accelerated change in control payments in accordance with the
Acknowledgement and Agreement, and advised the affected executives of the amounts to be repaid and the due date. Each executive has repaid to the Company all after-tax cash received by
such executive and filed all returns and other instruments necessary to effect the refund of all applicable taxes. Further, each executive has assigned his right to such tax refunds to the Company.

4.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all cash balances and highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and
cash equivalents.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash equivalents, corporate securities, interest rate swap
contracts and accounts receivable.

The
Company's policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution, and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being creditworthy, or in
short-term money market and tax-free bond funds which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risk. The Company has bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements
that exceed federally-insured limits.

Concentration
of credit risk, with respect to casino receivables, is limited through the Company's credit evaluation process. The Company issues markers to approved casino customers only
following credit checks and investigations of creditworthiness.

The
Company's receivables of $46.7 million and $43.6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily consist of $12.9 million and
$10.8 million, respectively, due from the West Virginia Lottery for gaming revenue settlements and capital reinvestment projects at the Charles Town



Entertainment
Complex, and $11.7 million and $11.4 million, respectively, for reimbursement of expenses paid on behalf of Casino Rama.

Accounts
are written off when management determines that an account is uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An allowance for doubtful
accounts is determined to reduce the Company's receivables to their carrying value, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on historical collection experience, specific review
of individual customer accounts, and current economic and business conditions. Historically, the Company has not incurred any significant credit-related losses.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is
practicable to estimate:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents,
due to the short maturity of the cash equivalents.

Investment in Corporate Debt Securities

The fair value of the investment in corporate debt securities is estimated based on quoted prices in active markets for identical
investments. The investment in corporate debt securities is measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Long-term Debt

The fair value of the Company's senior secured credit facility approximates its carrying value, as it is variable-rate
debt. The fair value of the Company's senior subordinated notes is estimated based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. The fair value of the Company's other
long-term obligations and capital leases approximates its carrying value.

Interest Rate Swap Contracts

The fair value of the Company's interest rate swap contracts is measured as the present value of all expected future cash flows based
on the LIBOR-based swap yield curve as of the date of the valuation, subject to a credit adjustment to the LIBOR-based yield curve's implied discount rates. The credit adjustment reflects the
Company's best estimate as to the Company's credit quality at December 31, 2009. The interest rate swap contracts are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

The
estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as follows (in thousands):

See
Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Company's assessment of the inputs used to measure the fair value for the investment in
corporate debt securities and interest rate swap contracts.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs that neither add materially to the
value of the asset nor appreciably prolong its useful life are charged to expense as incurred. Gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment are included in the determination of income.

Depreciation
of property and equipment is recorded using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Land improvements

5 to 15 years

Building and improvements

25 to 40 years

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment

3 to 7 years

Leasehold
improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the related lease term.

The
estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as the Company's current operating strategy.

The
Company reviews the carrying values of its property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by the Company in performing this assessment
include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. In estimating expected future cash flows for determining
whether an asset is impaired, assets are grouped at the individual property level. In assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment, the Company must make assumptions
regarding future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. Such an
impairment loss would be recognized as a non-cash component of operating income.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

At December 31, 2009, the Company had $1,380.0 million in goodwill and $377.0 million in other intangible assets
within its consolidated balance sheet, representing 29.3% and 8.0% of total assets, respectively, resulting from the Company's acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses and
racing permits. Two issues arise with respect to these assets that
require significant management estimates and judgment: (i) the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation; and (ii) the ongoing evaluation for impairment.

In
connection with the Company's acquisitions, valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices. The factors considered in the valuations include data gathered
as a result of the Company's due diligence in connection with the acquisitions, projections for future operations, and data obtained from third-party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate.
Goodwill is tested annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amount. If the carrying amount of
a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment test is performed to determine the implied value of goodwill for that reporting unit. If the implied value is less than the carrying amount for
that reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for that reporting unit. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350,
"Intangibles-Goodwill and Other," the Company considers its gaming license, racing permit and trademark intangible assets as



indefinite-life
intangible assets that do not require amortization. Rather, these intangible assets are tested annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, for
impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount. If the carrying amounts of the gaming license, racing permit and trademark intangible assets exceed their fair
value, an impairment loss is recognized. The evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting
unit to determine their estimated fair value. The Company uses a market approach model, which includes the use of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, charges for stock compensation, depreciation
and amortization, gain or loss on disposal of assets, and certain other income and expenses, and inclusive of loss from joint venture) multiples, as the Company believes that EBITDA is a
widely-used measure of performance in the gaming industry and as the Company uses EBITDA as the primary measurement of the operating performance of its properties (including the evaluation
of operating personnel). In addition, the Company believes that an EBITDA multiple is the principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. Changes in the estimated EBITDA multiple or forecasted
operations can materially affect these estimates. Once an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite-life intangible assets has been recorded, it cannot be reversed. Because the Company's
goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets are not amortized, there may be volatility in reported income because impairment losses, if any, are likely to occur irregularly and in
varying amounts. Intangible assets that have a definite-life, including the management service contract for Casino Rama, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives or related service contract. The Company reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets that have a definite-life for possible impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the intangible assets that have a definite-life exceed their fair value, an
impairment loss is recognized.

Deferred Financing Fees

Deferred financing fees that are incurred by the Company in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest
expense over the life of the underlying indebtedness, adjusted to reflect any early repayments.

Comprehensive Income

The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with ASC 220, "Comprehensive Income," which established standards for the
reporting and presentation of comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements. The Company presents comprehensive income in its consolidated statements of changes in shareholders'
equity.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes" ("ASC 740"). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax
rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized. ASC 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance, if necessary. The factors used to
assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. The Company has
used tax-planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits.

ASC
740 also creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions, and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial
statements by



prescribing
the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition,
measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is included in noncurrent tax liabilities
within the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009.

Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company uses fixed and variable-rate debt to finance its operations. Both funding sources have associated risks and
opportunities, such as interest rate exposure, and the Company's risk management policy permits the use of derivatives to manage this exposure. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Thus, uses of derivatives are strictly limited to hedging and risk management purposes in connection with managing interest rate exposure. Acceptable
derivatives for this purpose include interest rate swap contracts, futures, options, caps, and similar instruments.

When
using derivatives, the Company's intent is to apply "special hedge accounting," which is conditional upon satisfying specific documentation and performance criteria. In particular,
the underlying hedged item must expose the Company to risks associated with market fluctuations and the instrument used as the hedging derivative must generate offsetting effects in prescribed
magnitudes. If these criteria are not met, a change in the market value of the financial instrument and all associated settlements would be recognized as gains or losses in the period of change.

Currently,
the Company has a number of interest rate swap contracts in place. These contracts serve to mitigate income volatility for a portion of its variable-rate funding.
Swap contract coverage extends out through 2011. In effect, these swap contracts synthetically convert the portion of variable-rate debt being hedged to the equivalent of
fixed-rate funding. Under the terms of the swap contracts, the Company receives cash flows from the swap contract counterparties to offset the benchmark interest rate component of variable
interest payments on the hedged financings, in exchange for paying cash flows based on the swap contracts' fixed rates. These two respective obligations are net-settled, periodically. The
Company accounts for these swap contracts as cash flow hedges, which requires determining a division of hedge results deemed effective and deemed ineffective. However, most of the Company's hedges
were designed in such a way so as to perfectly offset specifically-defined interest payments, such that no ineffectiveness has occurred—nor would any ineffectiveness occur, as long as the
forecasted cash flows of the designated hedged items and the associated swap contracts remain unchanged.

The
fair value of the Company's interest rate swap contracts is measured as the present value of all expected future cash flows based on the LIBOR-based swap yield curve as of the date
of the valuation, subject to a credit adjustment to the LIBOR-based yield curve's implied discount rates. The credit adjustment reflects the Company's best estimate as to the Company's credit quality
at December 31, 2009.

Under
cash flow hedge accounting, effective derivative results are initially recorded in other comprehensive income ("OCI") and later reclassified to earnings, coinciding with the income
recognition relating to the variable interest payments being hedged (i.e., when the interest expense on the variable-rate liability is recorded in earnings). Any hedge
ineffectiveness (which represents the amount by which hedge results exceed the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction due to the risk being hedged) is recorded in current period
earnings.

Under
cash flow hedge accounting, derivatives are included in the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value. The interest rate swap contract liabilities are
included in accrued interest within the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009 and 2008.



During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company had certain derivative instruments that were not designated to qualify for hedge accounting. The
periodic change in the mark-to-market of these derivative instruments is recorded in current period earnings.

Credit
risk relating to derivative counterparties is mitigated by using multiple, highly rated counterparties, and the credit quality of each is monitored on an ongoing basis.

Revenue Recognition and Promotional Allowances

Gaming revenue is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for funds deposited by
customers before gaming play occurs, for chips and "ticket-in, ticket-out" coupons in the customers' possession, and for accruals related to the anticipated payout of
progressive jackpots. Progressive slot machines, which contain base jackpots that increase at a progressive rate based on the number of coins played, are charged to revenue as the amount of the
jackpots increase.

Revenue
from the management service contract for Casino Rama is based upon contracted terms, and is recognized when services are performed.

Food,
beverage and other revenue, including racing revenue, is recognized as services are performed. Racing revenue includes the Company's share of pari-mutuel wagering on
live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers, its share of wagering from import and export simulcasting, and its share of wagering from its off-track wagering facilities
("OTWs").

Revenues
are recognized net of certain sales incentives in accordance with ASC 605-50, "Revenue Recognition—Customer Payments and Incentives" ("ASC
605-50"). The consensus in ASC 605-50 requires that sales incentives and points earned in point-loyalty programs be recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company recognizes
incentives related to gaming play and points earned in point-loyalty programs as a direct reduction of gaming revenue.

The
retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenues and then deducted as promotional allowances.
The estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is primarily included in food, beverage and other expense. The amounts included in promotional allowances for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are as follows:

Earnings Per Share

The Company calculates earnings per share ("EPS") in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings Per Share" ("ASC 260"). Basic EPS is computed
by dividing net income applicable to common stock,



excluding
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the additional dilution for all
potentially-dilutive securities such as stock options.

In
the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company issued 12,500 shares of the Company's Preferred Stock, which the Company determined qualified as a participating security as defined in ASC
260. Under ASC 260, a security is considered a participating security if the security may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock, whether that participation is conditioned upon the
occurrence of a specified event or not. In accordance with ASC 260, a company is required to use the two-class method when computing EPS when a company has a security that qualifies as a
"participating security." The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends
declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. A participating security is included in the computation of basic EPS using the two-class method. Under the
two-class method, basic EPS for the Company's Common Stock is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock attributable to the shareholders of Penn National
Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS for the Company's Common Stock is computed using the more dilutive of the
two-class method or the if-converted method.

However,
since the Company reported a loss from operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, it was required by ASC 260 to use basic weighted-average common shares
outstanding, rather than diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding, when calculating diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. In addition, since the Company reported
a loss from operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Preferred Stock was not deemed to be a participating security for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
pursuant to ASC 260. The basic weighted-average common shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 78,121,571 and 84,535,877, respectively.

The
following table reconciles the weighted-average common shares outstanding used in the calculation of basic EPS to the weighted-average common shares outstanding used in the
calculation of diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2007:

to purchase 9,966,125 and 8,804,578 shares were outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, but were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS because they are antidilutive since the Company reported a loss from operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Options to purchase 1,395,610 shares were outstanding
during the year ended December 31, 2007, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because they are antidilutive.

The
repurchase of up to $200 million of the Company's Common Stock over the twenty-four month period ending July 2010 was authorized by the Company's Board of
Directors in July 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its Common Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
repurchased 8,934,984 shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions for approximately $152.6 million, at an average price of $17.05.



Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock compensation under ASC 718, "Compensation-Stock Compensation," which requires the Company to expense the
cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date
fair value of the award. This expense must be recognized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant.

The
fair value for stock options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires management to make certain assumptions. The
risk-free interest rate was based on the United States ("U.S.") Treasury spot rate with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Expected volatility was
estimated based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock price over a period of 5.32 years, in order to match the expected life of the options at the grant date. There is no expected
dividend yield since the Company has not paid any cash dividends on its Common Stock since its initial public offering in May 1994 and since the Company intends to retain all of its earnings to
finance the development of its business for the foreseeable future. The weighted-average expected life was based on the contractual term of the stock option and expected employee exercise dates, which
was based on the historical and expected exercise behavior of the Company's employees. Forfeitures are estimated at the date of grant based on historical experience. The following are the
weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

Segment Information

In accordance with ASC 280, "Segment Reporting" ("ASC 280"), the Company views each property as an operating segment, and aggregates
all of its properties into one reportable segment, as the Company believes that they are economically similar, offer similar types of products and services, cater to the same types of customers and
are similarly regulated.

Statements of Cash Flows

The Company has presented the consolidated statements of cash flows using the indirect method, which involves the reconciliation of net
(loss) income including noncontrolling interests to net cash flow from operating activities.

Acquisitions

The Company accounts for its acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations" ("ASC 805"). The results of operations of
acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.

Certain Risks and Uncertainties

The Company's operations are dependent on its continued licensing by state gaming commissions. The loss of a license, in any
jurisdiction in which the Company operates, could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations.

The
Company is dependent on each gaming property's local market for a significant number of its patrons and revenues. If economic conditions in these areas deteriorate or additional
gaming licenses are awarded in these markets, the Company's results of operations could be adversely affected.



The
Company is dependent on the economy of the U.S. in general, and any deterioration in the national economic, energy, credit and capital markets could have a material adverse effect on
future results of operations.

The
Company is dependent upon a stable gaming and admission tax structure in the locations that it operates in. Any change in the tax structure could have a material adverse affect on
future results of operations.

5.     New Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to improve disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance provides amendments to require new disclosures
regarding transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy, and activity in Level 3, and to clarify existing disclosures regarding the level of
disaggregation, inputs and valuation techniques. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the new disclosures regarding
purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010,
and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the guidance, except for the new disclosures regarding purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of
activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, as of January 1, 2010, as required. The Company does not expect that the January 1, 2010 adoption of the guidance will have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently determining the impact of the new disclosures regarding purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of
activity in Level 3 fair value measurements on its consolidated financial statements.

In
January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to address implementation issues related to the changes in ownership provisions in ASC 810, "Consolidation," ("ASC 810"). The guidance clarifies
the scope of the decrease in ownership provisions in ASC 810 and expands the disclosures about the deconsolidation of a subsidiary or derecognition of a group of assets within the scope of ASC 810. As
the Company previously adopted ASC 810, the guidance is effective beginning in the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after December 15, 2009, and should be applied
retrospectively to the first period that ASC 810 was adopted by the Company. The Company adopted the guidance as of December 31, 2009, as required. This guidance did not have a material impact
on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
September 2009, the FASB issued guidance concerning fair value measurements of investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). The
guidance creates a practical expedient to measure the fair value of an investment that is within the scope of the guidance on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment (or its
equivalent) determined as of the reporting entity's measurement date. Therefore, the guidance allows certain attributes of the investment, which in the past may have indicated that it was necessary to
make adjustments to the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) to estimate the fair value of the investment, to not be considered if the practical expedient is used. Additional disclosures are
also required under the guidance. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2009, with early application permitted. The Company adopted the guidance as
of December 31, 2009, as required. This guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
August 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the measurement of liabilities at fair value. The guidance provides clarification in measuring the fair value of liabilities. The guidance is
effective for the first
reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after issuance. The Company adopted the guidance as of October 1, 2009, as required. This guidance did not have a material impact on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued the ASC. The ASC became the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The ASC eliminates the previous U.S. GAAP hierarchy



and
establishes one level of authoritative GAAP. All other literature is considered non-authoritative. The ASC is effective for most financial statements issued for interim and annual
periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Company adopted the ASC as of September 30, 2009, as required. The adoption of the ASC did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated
financial statements.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued amended guidance for variable interest entities. The objective of the amended guidance is to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with
variable interest entities and to provide more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements. The amended guidance is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity's
first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter.
Earlier application is prohibited. The Company adopted the amended guidance as of January 1, 2010, as required. The Company does not expect that the adoption of the amended guidance will have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In
May 2009, the FASB issued guidance on subsequent events. The guidance establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date
but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. In addition, under the guidance, an entity is required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been
evaluated, as well as whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial statements were available to be issued. The guidance does not apply to subsequent
events or transactions that are within the scope of other applicable GAAP that provide different guidance on the accounting treatment for subsequent events or transactions. The guidance is effective
for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009, and shall be applied prospectively. The Company adopted the guidance as of June 30, 2009, as required. The adoption of
the guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In February 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance on subsequent events. The amended guidance removes
the requirement for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filers to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. The amended guidance is effective upon issuance, except for
the use of the issued date for conduit debt obligors. The Company adopted the amended guidance upon issuance, as required. The adoption of the amended guidance did not have a material impact on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2009, the FASB issued additional requirements regarding disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as
well as in annual
financial statements. The new requirements are effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company adopted the additional requirements as of June 30, 2009, as
required. The adoption of the new requirements did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance amends the
other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of
other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements. The guidance does not amend existing recognition and measurement guidance related to
other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company adopted
the guidance as of June 30, 2009, as required. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2009, the FASB issued guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and on identifying
transactions that are not orderly. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, and shall be applied prospectively. The Company adopted the
guidance as of June 30, 2009, as required. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.



In
April 2009, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies. The guidance
addresses application issues on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business
combination. The guidance is effective for all assets acquired or liabilities assumed arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of
the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2009, as required. The Company expects that the adoption of
the guidance will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements, in the event that the Company acquires companies in the future.

In
April 2008, the FASB issued guidance regarding the determination of the useful life of intangible assets. The guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing
renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. The Company adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2009, as required. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material
impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued guidance regarding the disclosure of derivative instruments and hedging activities. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures about an entity's derivative
and hedging activities. Specifically, entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about: a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; b) how derivative instruments and
related hedged items are accounted; and c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The guidance is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. The guidance encourages, but does not
require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. The Company adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2009, as required. The adoption of the guidance did not have a
material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued amended guidance on business combinations. The intention of the amended guidance is to improve reporting by creating greater consistency in the
accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. The amended guidance requires that the acquiring entity in a business combination recognize all (and only) the assets and liabilities
assumed in the transaction, establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and requires the acquirer to disclose
to investors and other users all of the information that they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. In addition, the amended guidance modifies
the accounting for transaction and restructuring costs. The amended guidance is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual
reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted the amended guidance as of January 1, 2009, as required. The Company expects that the adoption of the
amended guidance will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements, in the event that the Company acquires companies in the future.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued guidance on fair value measurements. The guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosure
requirements about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB amended the guidance so as to exclude from its scope certain accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements
associated with leases and to delay the effective date of the guidance to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). In October 2008, the FASB issued additional guidance that provides clarification on the
application of the guidance on fair value measurements in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when
the market for that financial asset is not active. The Company adopted the guidance on fair value measurements, as amended, and on a prospective basis,



as
of January 1, 2008. The January 1, 2008 adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted the guidance on fair value
measurements, as amended, and on a prospective basis, as of January 1, 2009 to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on a recurring basis. The January 1, 2009 adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

6.     Acquisitions

Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club

On October 17, 2007, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 5, 2007, the Company completed the purchase of
Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club in Longwood, Florida from Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club, Inc. and Collins and Collins. In connection with the purchase, the Company also secured a right of first
refusal with respect to a majority stake in the Sarasota Kennel Club in Sarasota, Florida. The purchase price for the Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club provides for additional consideration to be paid by
the Company based upon certain future regulatory developments. Located on approximately 26 acres in Longwood, Florida, the Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club features year-round greyhound racing,
a simulcast wagering facility, a clubhouse lounge and two dining areas. The Company accounted for the acquisition in accordance with ASC 805. The results of the Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club have been
included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.

Black Gold Casino at Zia Park

On April 16, 2007, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated November 7, 2006 among Zia Partners, LLC
("Zia"), Zia Park LLC (the "Buyer"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn, and (solely with respect to specified sections thereof which relate to the Company's guarantee of the Buyer's payment and
performance) Penn, the Buyer completed the acquisition of Black Gold Casino at Zia Park and all related assets of Zia. Penn funded this purchase with additional borrowings under its existing revolving
credit facility. The Company accounted for the acquisition in accordance with ASC 805. As a result of the acquisition, goodwill of $144.2 million and other intangible assets of
$2.9 million are included within the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. The results of the Black Gold Casino at Zia Park have been included in the Company's consolidated
financial statements since the acquisition date.

7.     Investment In and Advances to Unconsolidated Affiliates

On September 10, 2009, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement, subject to local and regulatory approvals and certain other closing
conditions, with principals of The Cordish Company ("Cordish"), the managing member of Kansas Entertainment, LLC ("Kansas Entertainment"), wherein
the Company agreed to acquire Cordish's 50% interest in Kansas Entertainment and to assume their role as managing member.

As
a result of the agreement with Cordish, the Company joined Kansas Speedway Development Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of International Speedway Corporation (which owns the
other 50% of Kansas Entertainment) in its application with the Kansas Lottery Commission to develop and operate a facility in the North East Gaming Zone in Wyandotte County, Kansas. The Company and
International Speedway Corporation will share equally the cost of developing and constructing the proposed facility, and intend to jointly seek third party financing for the project.

On
December 1, 2009, Kansas Entertainment was selected by the Kansas Lottery Gaming Facility Review Board to develop and operate a facility in the North East Gaming Zone in
Wyandotte County, Kansas.



In February 2010, Kansas Entertainment received the final approval under the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act, along with its gaming license from the Kansas Racing and
Gaming Commission, to proceed with the development of the facility.

On
September 14, 2009, as a result of the agreement with Cordish, the Company withdrew its license application with the Kansas Lottery Commission to be considered as a Lottery
Gaming Facility Manager at another site in Wyandotte County.

The
Company's investment in Kansas Entertainment, which consists of the Company's portion of the privilege fee paid to the Kansas Lottery Commission in conjunction with its application
and its portion of capital expenditures spent to develop the proposed facility, is accounted for under the equity method and is included in investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates
within the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009.

In
accordance with the agreement, $25.0 million was placed in escrow until certain conditions in the agreement with Cordish are satisfied. This amount is included in other assets
within the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009.

10.   Investment in Corporate Securities

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company made a $47.3 million investment in the corporate debt securities of other gaming companies. The
investment, which the Company is treating as available-for-sale securities, is included in other assets within the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009 and
2008. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded a $6.8 million unrealized gain and an $8.0 million unrealized loss, respectively, in OCI for this
investment. The change in the fair value also reflects the original issue discount amortization, which was $1.5 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively.

During

At
December 31, 2009, the Company was contingently obligated under letters of credit issued pursuant to the senior secured credit facility with face amounts aggregating
$27.9 million.

Senior Secured Credit Facility

The senior secured credit facility historically consisted of three credit facilities comprised of a $750 million revolving
credit facility with a maturity date of October 3, 2010, a $325 million Term Loan A Facility with a maturity date of October 3, 2011 and a $1.65 billion Term Loan B
Facility with a maturity date of October 3, 2012. In September 2009, the Company amended its senior secured credit facility, in order to increase the borrowing capacity and to extend the term
under the revolving credit facility portion of the senior secured credit facility. Under the new revolving credit facility, two tranches were created, one for those participants who agreed to extend
and one for those that did not extend. Tranche A Revolving Loans consist of available borrowings of $359.4 million, which are due on the original maturity date of October 3, 2010,
and Tranche B Revolving Loans consist of available borrowings of $640.6 million, which are due on July 3, 2012, for a total borrowing capacity of $1 billion.

In
August 2009, the Company repaid $40 million of borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility, $70 million of borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility, and all outstanding
borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the time, using a portion of the proceeds from the offering of $325 million 8


/


% senior subordinated notes. In addition, in
September 2009, the Company repaid all of the remaining outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility, using drawings under the new revolving credit facility.

As
of December 31, 2009, $237.5 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility and $1,518.1 million was outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility, for a
total of $1,755.6 million. As of December 31, 2008, $123.7 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility, $239.7 million was



outstanding
under the Term Loan A Facility, and $1,596.4 million was outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility, for a total of $1,959.8 million.

The
Company recorded a $2.4 million loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2009 for the write-off of deferred financing fees
related to the Term Loan A Facility.

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company's senior secured credit facility amount outstanding decreased by $204.2 million, primarily due to the August 2009
repayment of $40 million of borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility, $70 million of borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility, and all outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit
facility at the time, using a portion of the proceeds from the offering of $325 million 8


/


% senior subordinated notes. These repayments were partially offset by drawings under
the revolving credit facility, primarily to repay $105.5 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 6


/


% senior subordinated notes.

The
senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of Penn and its restricted subsidiaries.

Interest Rate Swap Contracts

In accordance with the terms of its senior secured credit facility, the Company was required to enter into fixed-rate debt
or interest rate swap agreements in an amount equal to 50% of the Company's consolidated indebtedness, excluding the revolving credit facility, within 100 days of the closing date of the senior
secured credit facility.

In
addition, during the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company amortized $15.9 million in OCI related to the derivatives that were de-designated as hedging
instruments under ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging."

In
the coming twelve months, the Company anticipates that approximately a $35.3 million loss will be reclassified from OCI to earnings, as part of interest expense. As this amount
represents effective hedge results, a comparable offsetting amount of incrementally lower interest expense will be realized in connection with the variable funding being hedged.

Other Long-Term Obligations

On October 15, 2004, the Company announced the sale of The Downs Racing, Inc. and its subsidiaries to the Mohegan Tribal
Gaming Authority ("MTGA"). Under the terms of the agreement, the MTGA acquired The Downs Racing, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Pocono Downs (a standardbred horse racing facility located
on 400 acres in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania) and five Pennsylvania OTWs located in Carbondale, East Stroudsburg, Erie, Hazelton and the Lehigh Valley (Allentown). The sale agreement also provided the
MTGA with certain post-closing termination rights in the event of certain materially adverse legislative or regulatory events. In January 2005, the Company received $280 million
from the MTGA, and transferred the operations of The Downs Racing, Inc. and its subsidiaries to the MTGA. The sale was not considered final for accounting purposes until the third quarter of
2006, as the MTGA had certain post-closing termination rights that remained outstanding. On August 7, 2006, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Purchase Agreement
and Release of Claims ("Amendment and Release") with the MTGA pertaining to the October 14, 2004 Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), and agreed to pay the MTGA an aggregate of
$30 million over five years, beginning on the first anniversary of the commencement of slot operations at Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs, in exchange for the MTGA's agreement to release various
claims it raised against the Company under the Purchase Agreement and the MTGA's surrender of all post-closing termination rights it might have had under the Purchase Agreement. The
Company recorded the present value of the $30 million liability within debt, as the amount due to the MTGA was payable over five years. In March 2009, the Company entered into the Third
Amendment to the Purchase
Agreement, in which the remaining payments due under the Purchase Agreement were accelerated and reduced. Under the Third Amendment to the Purchase Agreement, in exchange for the accelerated payment,
which was paid to the MTGA in March 2009, all remaining obligations under the Purchase Agreement were deemed to be satisfied and, as a result, the Company recorded a $1.3 million gain during
the year ended December 31, 2009, which is included in other income within the consolidated statements of operations.

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company placed some of the funds received from the issuance of its Preferred Stock into unrestricted subsidiaries, in order to allow
for maximum



flexibility
in the deployment of the funds. The funds and activity maintained within the unrestricted subsidiaries are excluded from the Company's covenant calculations.

At
December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all required financial covenants.

12.   Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

The Company is subject to various legal and administrative proceedings relating to personal injuries, employment matters, commercial
transactions and other matters arising in the normal course of business. The Company does not believe that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations. In addition, the Company maintains what it believes is adequate insurance coverage to further mitigate the risks of such proceedings. However,
such proceedings can be costly, time consuming and unpredictable and, therefore, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of such proceedings may not materially impact the Company's
consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Further, no assurance can be given that the amount or scope of existing insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover losses arising from
such matters.

The
following proceedings could result in costs, settlements, damages, or rulings that materially impact the Company's consolidated financial condition or operating results. In each
instance, the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses, claims and/or counter-claims, and intends to vigorously defend itself or pursue its claim.

In
conjunction with the Company's acquisition of Argosy Gaming Company in 2005, and subsequent disposition of the Argosy Casino Baton Rouge property, the Company became responsible for
litigation initiated in 1997 related to the Baton Rouge casino license formerly owned by Argosy. On November 26, 1997, Capitol House filed an amended petition in the Nineteenth Judicial
District Court for East Baton Rouge Parish, State of Louisiana, amending its previously filed but unserved suit against Richard Perryman, the person selected by the Louisiana Gaming Division to
evaluate and rank the applicants seeking a gaming license for East Baton Rouge Parish, and adding state law claims against Jazz Enterprises, Inc., the former Jazz Enterprises, Inc.
shareholders, Argosy, Argosy of Louisiana, Inc. and Catfish Queen Partnership in Commendam, d/b/a the Belle of Baton Rouge Casino. This suit alleged that these parties violated the Louisiana
Unfair Trade Practices Act in connection with obtaining the gaming license that was issued to Jazz Enterprises, Inc./Catfish Queen Partnership in Commendam. The plaintiff, an applicant for a
gaming license whose application was denied by the Louisiana Gaming Division, sought to prove that the gaming license was invalidly issued and to recover lost profits that the plaintiff contended it
could have earned if the gaming license had been issued to the plaintiff. On October 2, 2006, the Company prevailed on a partial summary judgment motion which limited plaintiff's damages to its
out-of-pocket costs in seeking its gaming license, thereby eliminating any recovery for potential lost gaming profits. On February 6, 2007, the jury returned a verdict
of $3.8 million (exclusive of statutory interest and attorneys' fees) against Jazz Enterprises, Inc. and Argosy. After ruling on post-trial motions, on September 27,
2007, the trial court entered a judgment in the amount of $1.4 million, plus attorneys' fees, costs and interest. The Company has the right to seek indemnification from two of the former Jazz
Enterprises, Inc. shareholders for any liability suffered as a result of such cause of action, however, there can be no assurance that the former Jazz Enterprises, Inc. shareholders will
have assets sufficient to satisfy any claim in excess of Argosy's recoupment rights. The Company established an appropriate reserve and bonded the judgment pending its appeal. Both the plaintiff and
the Company appealed the judgment to the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana. On August 31, 2009, the appellate court reversed the trial court's decision and dismissed the case against
Argosy in its entirety. Capitol House has requested that the Louisiana Supreme Court take its appeal of the dismissal and that request is currently pending.

The
Illinois Legislature passed into law House Bill 1918, effective May 26, 2006, which singled out four of the nine Illinois casinos, including the Company's Empress Casino Hotel
and Hollywood Casino



Aurora,
for a 3% tax surcharge to subsidize local horse racing interests. On May 30, 2006, Empress Casino Hotel and Hollywood Casino Aurora joined with the two other riverboats affected by the
law, Harrah's Joliet and the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin (collectively, the "Four Casinos"), and filed suit in the Circuit Court of the Twelfth Judicial District in Will County, Illinois (the
"Court"), asking the Court to declare the law unconstitutional. Empress Casino Hotel and Hollywood Casino Aurora began paying the 3% tax surcharge into a protest fund which accrues interest during the
pendency of the lawsuit. In two orders dated March 29, 2007 and April 20, 2007, the Court declared the law unconstitutional under the Uniformity Clause of the Illinois Constitution and
enjoined the collection of this tax surcharge. The State of Illinois requested, and was granted, a stay of this ruling. As a result, Empress Casino Hotel and Hollywood Casino Aurora continued paying
the 3% tax surcharge into the protest fund until May 25, 2008, when the 3% tax surcharge expired. The State of Illinois appealed the ruling to the Illinois Supreme Court. On June 5,
2008, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the trial court's ruling and issued a decision upholding the constitutionality of the 3% tax surcharge. On January 21, 2009, the Four Casinos filed a
petition for certiorari, requesting the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. Seven amicus curiae briefs supporting the plaintiffs' request were also filed. On June 8, 2009, the U.S. Supreme
Court decided not to hear the case. On June 10, 2009, the Four Casinos filed a petition with the Court to open the judgment based on new evidence that came to light during the investigation of
former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich that the 2006 law was procured by corruption. On August 17, 2009, the Court dismissed the Four Casinos' petition to reopen the case, and the Four
Casinos have decided not to pursue an appeal of the dismissal.

On
December 15, 2008, former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich signed Public Act No. 95-1008 requiring the Four Casinos to continue paying the 3% tax surcharge
to subsidize Illinois horse racing interests. On January 8, 2009, the Four Casinos filed suit in the Court, asking it to declare the law unconstitutional. The 3% tax surcharge being paid
pursuant to Public Act No. 95-1008 is paid into a protest fund where it accrues interest. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted on August 17, 2009.
The Four Casinos have appealed the dismissal and have filed a motion to keep the funds in the protest fund while the appeal is being litigated. The accumulated funds will be returned to Empress Casino
Hotel and Hollywood Casino Aurora if they ultimately prevail in the lawsuit.

On
June 12, 2009, the Four Casinos filed a lawsuit in Illinois Federal Court naming former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, his campaign fund, racetrack owner John Johnston, and
his two racetracks as defendants alleging a civil conspiracy in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §1962(c),(d) ("RICO"), based on an illegal
scheme to secure the enactment of the 3% tax surcharge legislation in exchange for the payment of money by Johnston and entities controlled by him. The Four Casinos also seek to impose a constructive
trust over all funds paid under the tax surcharge, and therefore all of the Illinois racetracks are named as parties to the lawsuit. The defendants in the RICO case filed motions to dismiss. On
December 7, 2009, the district court denied the motion to dismiss the RICO count, but it granted the motion to dismiss the constructive trust count, stating that it did not have jurisdiction in
this case to impose the constructive trust. The Four Casinos have appealed this dismissal to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellate court has ordered that any monies disbursed to the
tracks be maintained until the appeal has been decided.

In
August 2007, a complaint was filed on behalf of a putative class of public shareholders of the Company, and derivatively on behalf of the Company, in the Court of Common Pleas of
Berks County, Pennsylvania (the "Complaint"). The Complaint names the Company's Board of Directors as defendants and the Company as a nominal defendant. The Complaint alleges, among other things, that
the Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to the proposed transaction with Fortress and Centerbridge for inadequate consideration, that certain members of the Board of
Directors have conflicts with regard to the Merger, and that the Company and its Board of Directors have failed to disclose certain material information with regard to the Merger. The Complaint seeks,
among other things, a court order determining that the action is properly maintained as a class action



and
a derivative action enjoining the Company and its Board of Directors from consummating the proposed Merger, and awarding the payment of attorneys' fees and expenses. The Company and the plaintiff
had reached a tentative settlement, contingent upon consummation of the transaction with Fortress and Centerbridge, in which the Company agreed to pay certain attorneys' fees and to make certain
disclosures regarding the events leading up to the transaction with Fortress and Centerbridge in the proxy statement sent to shareholders in November 2007. The case was terminated by the court for
inactivity on September 7, 2009, and no payments were made.

On
July 16, 2008, the Company was served with a purported class action lawsuit brought by plaintiffs seeking to represent a class of shareholders who purchased shares of the
Company's Common Stock between March 20, 2008 and July 2, 2008. The lawsuit alleges that the Company's disclosure practices relative to the proposed transaction with Fortress and
Centerbridge and the eventual termination of that transaction were misleading and deficient in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint, which seeks class certification and
unspecified damages, was filed in federal court in Maryland. The complaint was amended, among other things, to add three new named plaintiffs and to name Peter M. Carlino, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, and William J. Clifford, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as additional defendants. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in November 2008, and the court
granted the motion and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied on October 21, 2009. The plaintiffs have appealed the decision
and the parties are in the process of filing appellate briefs.

On
September 11, 2008, the Board of County Commissioners of Cherokee County, Kansas (the "County") filed suit against Kansas Penn Gaming, LLC ("KPG," a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Penn created to pursue a development project in Cherokee County, Kansas) and the Company in the District Court of Shawnee County, Kansas. The petition alleges that KPG breached its
pre-development agreement with the County when KPG withdrew its application to manage a lottery gaming facility in Cherokee County and seeks in excess of $50 million in damages. In
connection with their petition, the County obtained an ex-parte order attaching the $25 million privilege fee paid to the Kansas Lottery Commission in conjunction with the gaming
application for the Cherokee County zone. The defendants have filed motions to dissolve and reduce the attachment. Those motions were denied and the defendants appealed those decisions to the
appellate court. The Kansas appellate court declined to hear the appeal on jurisdictional grounds and the defendants have requested that the Kansas Supreme Court review that decision.

On
September 23, 2008, KPG filed an action against HV Properties of Kansas, LLC ("HV") in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas seeking a declaratory judgment
from the U.S. District Court finding that KPG has no further obligations to HV under a Real Estate Sale Contract (the "Contract") that KPG and HV entered into on September 6, 2007, and that KPG
properly terminated this Contract under the terms of the Repurchase Agreement entered into between the parties effective September 28, 2007. HV filed a counterclaim claiming KPG breached the
Contract, and seeks $37.5 million in damages. On October 7, 2008, HV filed suit against the Company claiming the Company is liable to HV for KPG's alleged breach based on a Guaranty
Agreement signed by the Company. Both cases were consolidated. The Company filed a motion to dismiss HV's claims, which was denied on May 6, 2009. Discovery has concluded and dispositive
motions are currently being briefed by both sides.

Operating Lease Commitments

The Company is liable under numerous operating leases for airplanes, automobiles, land for the property on which some of its casinos
operate, other equipment and buildings, which expire at various dates through 2093. Total rental expense under these agreements was $31.5 million, $30.7 million and $29.6 million
for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.



The leases for land consist of annual base lease rent payments plus, in some instances, a percentage rent based on a percent of adjusted gaming wins, as described
in the respective leases.

The
Company has an operating lease with the City of Bangor which covers the permanent facility that opened on July 1, 2008. Under the lease agreement, there is a fixed rent
provision, as well as a revenue-sharing provision which is equal to 3% of gross slot revenue. The final term of the lease, which commenced with the opening of the permanent facility, is for an initial
term of fifteen years, with three ten-year renewal options.

On
March 23, 2007, BTN, Inc. ("BTN"), one of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into an amended and restated ground lease (the "Amended Lease") with Skrmetta
MS, LLC. The lease amends the prior ground lease, dated October 19, 1993. The Amended Lease requires BTN to maintain a minimum gaming operation on the leased premises and to pay rent
equal to 5% of adjusted gaming win after gaming taxes have been deducted. The term of the Amended Lease expires on January 1, 2093.

The
future minimum lease commitments relating to the base lease rent portion of noncancelable operating leases at December 31, 2009 are as follows (in thousands):

Capital Expenditure Commitments

At December 31, 2009, the Company was contractually committed to spend approximately $53.1 million in capital
expenditures for projects in progress.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a profit-sharing plan under the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, which covers all eligible employees. The plan enables participating employees to defer a portion of their salary in a retirement fund to be administered by the Company. The Company makes a
discretionary match contribution of 50% of employees' elective salary deferrals, up to a maximum of 6% of eligible employee compensation.

The
Company also has a defined contribution plan, the Charles Town Races Future Service Retirement Plan, covering substantially all of its union employees at the Charles Town
Entertainment Complex. The Company makes annual contributions to this plan for the eligible union employees and to the Penn National Gaming, Inc. 401(k) Plan for the eligible
non-union employees for an amount equal to the amount accrued for retirement expense, which is calculated as 0.25% of the daily mutual handle and 1.0% up to a base of the net video lottery
revenues and, after the base is met, it reverts to 0.5%.

The
Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that covers most management and other highly-compensated employees. This plan was effective March 1,
2001. The plan allows the participants to defer, on a pre-tax basis, a portion of their base annual salary and bonus, and earn tax-deferred earnings on these deferrals. The
plan also provides for matching Company contributions that vest over a five-year period. The Company has established a Trust, and transfers to the Trust, on a periodic basis, an amount
necessary to provide for its respective future liabilities with respect to



participant
deferral and Company contribution amounts. The Company's matching contributions in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $1.5 million, $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively.

Agreements with Horsemen and Pari-Mutuel Clerks

The Company is required to have agreements with the horsemen at each of its racetracks to conduct its live racing and simulcasting
activities, with the exception of the Company's tracks in Ohio and New Mexico. In addition, in order to operate gaming machines in West Virginia, the Company must maintain agreements with each of the
Charles Town Horsemen, pari-mutuel clerks and breeders.

At
the Charles Town Entertainment Complex, the Company has an agreement with the Charles Town Horsemen with an initial term expiring on December 31, 2011, and an agreement with
the breeders that expires on June 30, 2010. The pari-mutuel clerks at Charles Town are represented under a collective bargaining agreement with the West Virginia Division of Mutuel
Clerks, which expires on December 31, 2010.

The
Company's agreement with the Pennsylvania Thoroughbred Horsemen at Penn National Race Course expires on September 30, 2011. The Company has a collective bargaining agreement
with Local 137 of the Sports Arena Employees (AFL-CIO) at Penn National Race Course with respect to pari-mutuel clerks, admissions and Telebet personnel which expires on
December 31, 2011. The Company also has an agreement in place with the Sports Arena Employees
Local 137 (AFL-CIO) with respect to pari-mutuel clerks and admission personnel at the Company's OTWs, which expired on September 30, 2009 and has been extended pending
continuing negotiations.

The
Company's agreement with the Maine Harness Horsemen Association at Bangor Raceway expires on December 31, 2011.

The
Company's agreement with the Ohio Harness Horsemen Association expires on December 31, 2012.

Pennwood
Racing, Inc. also has an agreement in effect with the horsemen at Freehold Raceway, which expires on December 31, 2011.

Throughout
the Argosy properties, the Seafarers Entertainment and Allied Trade Union represents approximately one thousand eight hundred of the Company's employees. At the Empress Casino
Hotel, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union ("UNITE/HERE") Local 1 represents approximately three hundred employees under a collective bargaining agreement which expires on
March 31, 2011. At certain of the Company's Argosy properties, the Seafarer International Union of North America, Atlantic, Gulf, Lakes and Inland Waters District/NMU, AFL-CIO, the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Security Police and Fire Professionals of America, the American Maritime Officers Union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local
176, and UNITE/HERE Local 10 represent certain of the Company's employees. The Company has collective bargaining agreements with these unions that expire at various times between July 2010 and October
2015. None of these unions individually represent more than fifty of the Company's employees.

If
the Company fails to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at a track, it will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting at that track and
OTWs and, in West Virginia, the Company will not be permitted to operate its gaming machines. In addition, the Company's simulcasting agreements are subject to the horsemen's approval. If the Company
fails to renew or modify existing agreements on satisfactory terms, this failure could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Except for the
closure of the facilities at Penn National Race Course and its OTWs from February 16, 1999 to March 24, 1999 due to a horsemen's strike, and a few days at other times and locations, the
Company has been able to maintain the necessary agreements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain the required agreements.



New Jersey Joint Venture

On January 28, 1999, the Company, along with its joint venture partner, Greenwood Limited Jersey, Inc. ("Greenwood"),
purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Freehold Racing Association, Garden State Racetrack and related entities, in a transaction accounted for as a purchase transaction.

In
1999, the Company made an $11.3 million loan to the joint venture and an equity investment of $0.3 million. In 2008, the balance of the loan was increased by
$0.5 million to $11.8 million to substitute a payment of interest on the loan. The loan is evidenced by a subordinated secured note, which is included in investment in and advances to
unconsolidated affiliates within the consolidated balance sheets. The $11.3 million portion of the note bears interest at prime plus 2.25% or a minimum of 10.00% (at December 31, 2009,
the interest rate was 10.00%). The $0.5 million portion of the note bears interest at the lesser of prime plus 2.00% or the 30-day LIBOR plus 3.00% (at December 31, 2009, the
interest rate was 3.23%). The Company has recorded interest income within the consolidated statements of operations of $1.2 million, $1.2 million and $1.2 million for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The
joint venture, through Freehold Racing Association, was part of a multi-employer pension plan. For collectively bargained, multi-employer pension plans, contributions were made in
accordance with negotiated labor contracts and generally were based on days worked. With the passage of the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, the joint venture may, under certain
circumstances, become subject to liabilities in excess of contributions made under collective bargaining agreements. Generally, these liabilities are contingent upon the termination, withdrawal, or
partial withdrawal from the plans. In June 2006, Freehold Racing Association withdrew from the multi-employer pension plan, and thereby became subject to payment of a withdrawal liability to the
multi-employer pension plan. In January 2008, Freehold Racing Association was informed that the multi-employer pension plan experienced a mass withdrawal termination as of December 25, 2007. In
November 2009, Freehold Racing Association received notice and demand for payment of the reallocation component of the joint venture withdrawal liability. The reallocation liability was calculated to
be $5.1 million as of the date of withdrawal. Freehold Racing Association's obligation will continue until 2055 or such time that it is notified that the obligation has been satisfied. At
December 31, 2009, the joint venture withdrawal liability was approximately $5.0 million for Freehold Racing Association.

The
Company and Greenwood entered into a Debt Service Maintenance Agreement with a bank in which each joint venture partner has guaranteed up to 50% of a $23.0 million term loan
to the joint venture. The Debt Service Maintenance Agreement remains in effect for the life of the loan and was due to expire on September 30, 2009. In 2008, the joint venture borrowed an
additional $1.75 million and the maturity date of the term loan was extended to September 30, 2013. In 2009, certain terms and conditions of the agreement were amended, including the
interest rates to be applied and the payment schedule. At December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance on the loan to the joint venture amounted to $8.7 million, of which the Company's
obligation under its guarantee of the term loan was limited to approximately $4.4 million. The Company's investment in the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. The original
investment was recorded at cost and has been adjusted by the Company's share of income (loss) of the joint venture and distributions received. The Company's 50% share of the
income (loss) of the joint venture is included in other income (expenses) within the consolidated statements of operations.

13.   Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for the effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount
in the consolidated balance sheets. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years.

For
income tax reporting, the Company has state net operating loss carryforwards aggregating approximately $157.3 million available to reduce future state income taxes primarily
for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Mississippi as of December 31, 2009. The tax benefit associated with these net operating loss carryforwards is approximately
$7.4 million. Due to state tax statutes on annual net operating loss utilization limits, the availability of gaming tax credits, and income and loss projections in the applicable jurisdictions,
a $3.9 million valuation allowance has been recorded to reflect the net operating losses which are not presently expected to be realized. In addition, a $0.4 million valuation has been
recorded to reflect the income tax effect of unrealized capital loss carryforwards of the Company which are not presently expected to be realized. If not used, substantially all the carryforwards will
expire at various dates from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2029. In the event that the valuation allowance is ultimately unnecessary, the majority would be treated as a reduction of
tax expense.

In
addition, certain subsidiaries have accumulated state net operating loss carryforwards aggregating approximately $650.5 million for which no benefit has been recorded as they
are attributable to uncertain tax positions. The unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2009 attributable to these net operating losses was approximately $42.1 million. Due to the
uncertain tax position, these net operating losses are not included as components of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009. In the event of
any benefit from realization of these net operating losses, $8.6 million would be treated as an increase to equity, and the remainder would be treated as a reduction of tax expense. If not
used, substantially all the carryforwards will expire at various dates from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2029.

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740, the Company recognized a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of
approximately $11.9 million, which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 retained earnings balance. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is included in
noncurrent tax liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Included
in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $9.5 million and $31.7 million, respectively, of tax positions that are
indemnified by a third party. The indemnification stems from a transaction the Company completed in 2001 with The Continental Companies and CHC International, Inc. (the "Seller") whereby the
Company acquired Casino Rouge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and the management contract for Casino Rama in Orillia, Ontario, Canada. As part of the acquisition, Continental and the Company entered into an
Indemnification Agreement whereby Continental indemnified the Company for any tax liabilities to arise subsequent to the acquisition for taxation years which Continental was the owner. The Canada
Revenue Agency ("CRA") proposed a reassessment of CHC Canada in respect to its 1996 through 2000 taxation years. The
Company and Seller disagreed with the CRA's position, and the matter was placed in Competent Authority in 2004.

On
May 20, 2009, the Company was notified by the Competent Authority Services Division of the CRA that the CRA and the U.S. Competent Authority ("IRS") negotiated a settlement
regarding the years under assessment from the CRA—1996 through 2000 taxation years. According to the terms of the agreement, the CRA had agreed to reduce their original disallowance of
management fees charged by the Company's indirect U.S. subsidiary CRC Holdings, Inc. to CHC Casinos Canada, Limited from CND$54,472,752 to CND$13,556,919 in exchange for the IRS granting relief
by allowing CRC Holdings-US to decrease its income by $9,130,658 (US$) (or $13,556,919 (CND$)) and repay the $9,130,658 (US$) to CHC Casinos Canada Limited free of any U.S. withholding
taxes.

On
November 27, 2009, the Company received from the CRA Notice of Reassessment ("Notice") for the taxation years covered under the Component Authority settlement. In accordance
with the terms of the Notice, the Company paid CND$8,466,363.09 on December 16, 2009. Based upon the calculations within the Notice, the Company recalculated its pre-acquisition
liability/indemnification receivable and decreased its liability/indemnification receivable. As of December 31, 2009, the Company is currently working with Continental to be reimbursed in
accordance with the Indemnification Agreement. Once payment is received by the Company, it will reverse the federal portion of the indemnification receivable. For the years after 2001, where the
Company has no indemnification, it has included in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits $22.0 million of tax reserves, including $12.6 million of accrued interest and penalties.

Included
in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $10.0 million and ($20.0) million, respectively, of currency translation
adjustments for foreign currency tax positions.



Included in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $37.2 million and $36.6 million, respectively, of
tax positions that, if reversed, would affect the effective tax rate.

The
Company is required under ASC 740 to disclose its accounting policy for classifying interest and penalties, the amount of interest and penalties charged to expense each period, as
well as the cumulative amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company will continue to classify any tax-related penalties and interest accrued related to unrecognized tax
benefits in taxes on income within the consolidated statements of operations.

During
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized approximately $2.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of interest and penalties, net
of deferred taxes. In addition, due to settlements and/or reductions in previously recorded liabilities on uncertain tax positions, the Company had reductions in previously accrued interest and
penalties of $1.6 million, net of deferred taxes. The Company has accrued approximately $25.9 million (gross) for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31, 2009. These
accruals were included in noncurrent tax liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009.

The
Company is currently in various stages of the examination and appeal process in connection with our open audits. Generally, it is difficult to determine when these examinations will
be closed, but the
Company reasonably expects that its ASC 740 liabilities will not significantly change over the next twelve months.

As
of December 31, 2009, the Company is subject to U.S. Federal income tax examinations for the tax years 2006, 2007 and 2008. In addition, the Company is subject to state and
local income tax examinations for various tax years in the taxing jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

14.   Shareholders' Equity

Shareholder Rights Plan

On May 20, 1998, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock
purchase right (the "Right" or "Rights") for each outstanding share of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on
March 19, 1999. In addition, a Right was issued for each share of the Company's Common Stock issued after March 19, 1999 and prior to the Rights' expiration. Each Right entitled the
registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share (a "Preferred Stock Fraction") of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock (or another series of preferred
stock with substantially similar terms), or a combination of securities and assets of equivalent value, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Preferred Stock Fraction, subject to adjustment. The
description and terms of the Rights were set forth in a Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") dated March 2, 1999, and amended on June 15, 2007, between the Company and Continental
Stock Transfer and Trust Company as Rights Agent. The Rights Agreement and the associated Rights expired on March 18, 2009.

Issuance of the $1.25 billion, Zero Coupon Preferred Equity Investment

On July 3, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with certain affiliates of Fortress and Centerbridge, terminating the
Merger Agreement. In connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company agreed to receive a total of $1.475 billion, consisting of the Cash Termination Fee and the Investment.
On October 30, 2008, the Company closed the sale of the Investment and issued 12,500 shares of Preferred Stock.

The
Investment is generally non-voting, but possesses voting rights with respect to certain extraordinary events. The Investment is entitled to vote with the Common Stock on
an as-converted basis with respect to any change-in-control or other significant transaction if the consideration to be paid to shareholders is less than $45 per
share (which amount is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). In addition, the approval of holders of a majority of the Investment shares is required



to
authorize (i) special dividends to security holders of the Company; (ii) issuance by the Company of equity securities senior to or on a parity with the Investment; (iii) stock
repurchases, including but not limited to, by means of a tender offer which is funded by an asset sale outside the ordinary course (other than repurchases in the open market and repurchases by tender
offer at not greater than a 20% premium); and (iv) certain other amendments to the terms of the Investment. The Investment has an aggregate liquidation preference equal to $1.25 billion,
the aggregate purchase price paid for the Investment shares (the "Purchase Price"), subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the Investment terms provide that the Investment participates in any
dividends paid on the Common Stock. To the extent that the Company pays a special dividend, such special dividend will reduce the amount to be paid to the holders of the Investment upon a liquidation
or redemption.

The
Company is required to redeem all of the outstanding shares of the Investment on June 30, 2015, unless a change-in-control transaction in which all
holders of shares of the Common Stock receive consideration in the transaction has occurred prior to that time. In the event of such a change-in-control transaction, the
holders of the Investment will receive cash and/or other consideration in such transaction (the same consideration as the holders of Common Stock receive) with a value equal to the net present value
of the Purchase Price, subject to increase or decrease in the event that the value of the consideration paid to the holders of the Common Stock is greater than $67 per share or less than $45 per
share, respectively, which thresholds are subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

The
redemption price to be paid to the holders of the Investment on June 30, 2015 is equal to the Purchase Price, subject to increase or decrease in the event that the average
trading price of the Common Stock (measured over the 20 consecutive trading days prior to May 26, 2015) is greater than $67 per share or less than $45 per share, respectively. There is no
coupon payable with respect to the Investment. The Company shall redeem all of the Investment for cash, provided the Company may elect on or prior to June 1, 2015 to pay all or part of the
redemption price in shares of the Common Stock. At December 31, 2009, the redemption price was $755.3 million (27.8 million shares of Common Stock if the Company elected to redeem
through the issuance of Common Stock).

The
holders of the Investment are subject to the Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of July 3, 2008, by and among the Company, FIF V PFD LLC, Centerbridge Capital
Partners, L.P., DB Investment Partners, Inc. and Wachovia Investment Holdings, LLC. (the "Investor Rights Agreement"), which, among other things, contains a voting agreement
requiring certain Investment holders to vote all of their shares of Common Stock as directed by the Company and a standstill agreement restricting the activities of certain Investment holders. In
addition, Investment holders who may receive 20% or more of the outstanding Common Stock upon redemption would be subject to Subchapter 25G of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988,
as amended (the "Control Share Statute"). The Control Share Statute prohibits any person or group that acquires more than 20% of the voting power
of the Company from voting any securities held by such person or group unless the shareholders vote to accord voting rights to such securities within 90 days of the time such threshold was
exceeded. Under the Investment terms, unless such shareholder approval is obtained, the Investment holders shall execute and deliver a proxy in favor of an attorney-in-fact to
be designated by the Board of Directors covering the number of shares of Common Stock necessary to avoid the application of the Control Share Statute.

The
Investor Rights Agreement also provides that until Fortress and its affiliates own less than two-thirds of the shares of the Investment issued to them on
October 30, 2008, Fortress and the Company must take all action in their power to appoint one designee of the purchasers (the "Purchaser Designee") as a Class II director on the Board of
Directors and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the election of the Purchaser Designee at every meeting thereafter at which a Class II director is to be elected. The initial
Purchaser Designee is Wesley R. Edens. Mr. Edens is the founding principal, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Fortress.



Under
the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to file a short-form registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
for the registration and sale of Investment shares and certain shares of Common Stock owned by the purchasers ("Registrable Securities"), which it filed on December 30, 2008. The Company is
required to keep the shelf registration statement continuously effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, until the earlier of (i) such time as all Registrable Securities have been
sold and (ii) such time as the purchasers beneficially own (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) less than 2.5% of the Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis (including Common Shares
issuable upon redemption of the Investment shares at maturity). The purchasers and any permitted transferees of Registrable Securities are also entitled to four demand registrations and unlimited
piggyback registration during the term of the Investor Rights Agreement.

Pursuant
to the Investor Rights Agreement, the Investment holders may not directly or indirectly sell, transfer, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of any portion of any
Investment shares to any person without the prior written consent of the Company prior to July 21, 2009. However, the Investment holders may sell, transfer, pledge, encumber, assign or
otherwise dispose of their Investment shares prior to July 21, 2009 if such transaction is made: (i) to an affiliate of any such Investment holder which agrees to be bound by the terms
of the Investor Rights Agreement; (ii) with the prior written consent of the Company's Board of Directors, to a person pursuant to a tender or exchange offer for Investment shares or Common
Stock by such person or a merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with such person; (iii) if the Company acknowledges in writing that it is unable to pay its debts, commences a
voluntary case in bankruptcy or a voluntary petition seeking reorganization or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (iv) if the Company consents to the entry of an order for
relief against it seeking liquidation, reorganization or a creditor's arrangement of the Company.

Under
the Investor Rights Agreement, each Investment holder has preemptive rights with respect to certain sales of Common Stock, stock options or securities convertible into Common Stock
for so long as such holder beneficially owns at least two-thirds of the shares of the Investment issued to it on October 30, 2008.

15.   Noncontrolling Interests

In November 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with Lakes Entertainment, Inc. ("Lakes"), permitting Lakes to invest in up to a 10% equity interest
in each of the Company's proposed facilities in Columbus and Toledo, Ohio. During the year ended December 31, 2009, Lakes contributed $1.9 million to the Company towards the proposed
facilities, and its portion of the net loss for the proposed facilities was $2.5 million. The noncontrolling interest is included in shareholders' equity within the consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2009, stated separately from the Company's shareholders' equity.

16.   Stock-Based Compensation

In April 1994, the Company's Board of Directors and shareholders adopted and approved the 1994 Stock Option Plan (the "1994 Plan"). The 1994 Plan permitted the
grant of options to purchase up to 12,000,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to antidilution adjustments, at a price per share no less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the
date an option is granted with respect to incentive stock options only. The price would be no less than 110% of fair market value in the case of an incentive stock option granted to any individual who
owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of outstanding stock. The 1994 Plan provided for the granting of both incentive stock options intended to qualify under
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and nonqualified stock options, which do not so qualify. The options granted prior to the 2003 Plan remain outstanding.



On
April 16, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors adopted and approved the 2003 Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2003 Plan"). On May 22, 2003, the Company's
shareholders approved the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan was effective June 1, 2003 and permitted the grant of options to purchase Common Stock and other market-based and performance-based awards. Up
to 12,000,000 shares of Common Stock were available for awards under the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan provided for the granting of both incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and nonqualified stock options, which do not so qualify. The exercise price per share may be no less than (i) 100% of the fair market value of
the Common Stock on the date an option is granted for incentive stock options and (ii) 85% of the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date an option is granted for nonqualified stock options. This plan will remain in place until it terminates in 2013. However the shares which remained available for issuance under
such plan as of November 12, 2008 are no longer available for issuance and all future equity awards will be pursuant to the 2008 Plan described below.

On
August 20, 2008, the Company's Board of Directors adopted and approved the 2008 Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2008 Plan"). On November 12, 2008, the
Company's shareholders approved the 2008 Plan. The 2008 Plan permits the Company to issue stock options (incentive and/or non-qualified), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
phantom stock units and other equity and cash awards to employees. Non-employee directors are eligible to receive all such awards, other than incentive stock options. The aggregate number
of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the 2008 Plan shall not exceed 6,900,000. Awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights will be counted against the 6,900,000 limit as one
share of Common Stock for each share granted. However each share awarded in the form of restricted stock, phantom stock units or any other full value stock award will be counted as issuing 2.16 shares
of Common Stock for purposes of determining the number of shares available for issuance under the plan. At December 31, 2009, there were 4,401,889 options available for future grants under the
2008 Plan.

Stock
options that expire between February 12, 2010 and September 11, 2018 have been granted to officers, directors and employees to purchase Common Stock at prices ranging
from $7.75 to $61.82 per share. All options were granted at the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date the options were granted.

conjunction with the opening of the new casino riverboat at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge for the replaced Lawrenceburg
vessel of $11.7 million ($6.8 million, net of taxes) during the second quarter of 2009. In addition, as a result of the anticipated impact of gaming expansion in Ohio, the Company
recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $520.5 million ($368.8 million, net of taxes) during the fourth quarter of 2009, as the Company determined that a portion of the value

21.   Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the
various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach, and cost approach). The levels of the hierarchy are described below:

•

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions.

The
Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their
placement within the fair value hierarchy.

The
following tables set forth the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by input level, in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009 and
2008 (in thousands):

market approach.

In
conjunction with the opening of the new casino riverboat at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge for the replaced Lawrenceburg
vessel of $11.9 million ($7.1 million, net of taxes) during the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, as a result of the anticipated impact of gaming expansion in Ohio, the
Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $520.5 million ($368.8 million, net of taxes) during the year ended December 31, 2009, as the Company determined that a
portion of the value of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets associated with the original purchase of Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg was impaired.

22.   Empress Casino Hotel Fire

On March 20, 2009, the Company's Empress Casino Hotel, which was undergoing a $55 million renovation, was closed following a fire that started in
the land-based pavilion at the facility. All customers and employees were successfully evacuated, and the fire was contained on the land-side of the property before it could
spread to the adjacent casino barge. On June 25, 2009, the casino barge was reopened with temporary land-based facilities, and the Company began construction of a new
land-based pavilion.

The
Company carries a builders' risk insurance policy for the on-going renovations with a policy limit of $57 million, inclusive of $14 million for delay in
completion and $43 million for property damage. The builders' risk insurance policy includes a $50,000 property damage deductible and a 30-day delay in completion deductible for the
peril of fire. In addition, the Company carries comprehensive business interruption and property damage insurance for the operational components of the Empress Casino Hotel with an overall limit of
$228 million. The operational insurance policy includes a $2.5 million property damage deductible and a 48-hour business interruption deductible for the peril of fire.

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a $6.1 million pre-tax loss for the insurance deductibles for property damage, business
interruption and employee lost wages, as well as a write-off of construction fees related to the renovation that are not recoverable under the Company's insurance policies.

The
$33.5 million insurance receivable recorded at December 31, 2009 was limited to the net book value of assets believed to be damaged, destroyed or abandoned and other
costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of the fire at Empress Casino Hotel that are expected to be
recovered via the insurance claim. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company received $20.6 million in insurance proceeds related to the fire at Empress Casino Hotel.

23.   Discontinued Operations—Sale of The Downs Racing, Inc. and Subsidiaries

On October 15, 2004, the Company announced the sale of The Downs Racing, Inc. and its subsidiaries to the MTGA. Under the terms of the agreement,
the MTGA acquired The Downs Racing, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Pocono Downs (a standardbred horse racing facility located on 400 acres in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania) and five
Pennsylvania OTWs located in Carbondale, East Stroudsburg, Erie, Hazelton and the Lehigh Valley (Allentown). The sale agreement also provided the



MTGA
with certain post-closing termination rights in the event of certain materially adverse legislative or regulatory events. In January 2005, the Company received $280 million
from the MTGA, and transferred the operations of The Downs Racing, Inc. and its subsidiaries to the MTGA. The sale was not considered final for accounting purposes until the third quarter of
2006, as the MTGA had certain post-closing termination rights that remained outstanding. On August 7, 2006, the Company entered into the Amendment and Release with the MTGA
pertaining to the Purchase Agreement, and agreed to pay the MTGA an aggregate of $30 million over five years, beginning on the first anniversary of the commencement of slot operations at
Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs, in exchange for the MTGA's agreement to release various claims it raised against the Company under the Purchase Agreement and the MTGA's surrender of all
post-closing termination rights it might have had under the Purchase Agreement. The Company recorded the present value of the $30 million liability within debt, as the amount due to
the MTGA was payable over five years. In March 2009, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Purchase Agreement, in which the remaining payments due under the Purchase Agreement were
accelerated and reduced. Under the Third Amendment to the Purchase Agreement, in exchange for the accelerated payment, which was paid to the MTGA in March 2009, all remaining obligations under the
Purchase Agreement were deemed to be satisfied and, as a result, the Company recorded a $1.3 million gain during the year ended December 31, 2009, which is included in other income
within the consolidated statements of operations.

24.   Subsequent Events

The Company evaluated all subsequent events through the date that the consolidated financial statements were issued. No material subsequent events have occurred
since December 31, 2009 that required recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2009, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In
addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and concluded that it was effective as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment,
we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

.

The
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board
of Directors

Penn National Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries

We
have audited Penn National Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Penn National Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries'
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Penn National Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Penn National
Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
