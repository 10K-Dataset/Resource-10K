IMPORTANT FACTORS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This document includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are included throughout the document, including the section entitled "Risk Factors," and relate to our
business strategy, our prospects and our financial position. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may,"
"will," "should" or "anticipates" or the negative or other variation of these or similar words, or by discussions of future events, strategies or risks and uncertainties. Specifically, forward-looking
statements may include, among others, statements concerning:

•

our expectations of future results of operations or financial condition;

•

our expectations for our operating properties or our development projects;

•

the timing, cost and expected impact of planned capital expenditures on our results of operations;

•

the impact of our geographic diversification and competition;

•

our expectations with regard to further acquisitions and development opportunities, as well as the integration of any companies we
have acquired or may acquire;

•

the outcome and financial impact of the litigation in which we are or will be periodically involved;

•

the actions of regulatory, legislative, executive or judicial decisions at the federal, state or local level with regard to our
business and the impact of any such actions;

•

our ability to maintain regulatory approvals for our existing businesses and to receive regulatory approvals for our new businesses;

•

our expectations regarding economic and consumer conditions; and

•

our expectations for the continued availability and cost of capital.

Although
Penn National Gaming, Inc. ("Penn") and its subsidiaries (together with Penn, collectively, the "Company") believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are reasonable, they are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about our subsidiaries and us, and accordingly, our forward-looking statements are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the factors described below and in the information incorporated by reference herein. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the
forward-looking statements include, without limitation, risks related to the following:

•

our ability to obtain timely regulatory approvals required to own, develop and/or operate our facilities, or other delays or
impediments to completing our planned acquisitions or projects, including favorable resolution of any related litigation, including the ongoing appeal by the Ohio Roundtable addressing the legality of
video lottery terminals in Ohio;

•

our ability to secure federal, state and local permits and approvals necessary for our construction projects;

•

construction factors, including delays, unexpected remediation costs, local opposition, organized labor, and increased cost of labor
and materials;

•

our ability to maintain agreements with our horsemen, pari-mutuel clerks and other organized labor groups;

ii


•

with respect to the proposed Jamul project near San Diego, California, particular risks associated with financing a project of this
type, sovereign immunity, local opposition (including several pending lawsuits), and building a complex project on a relatively small parcel;

•

the passage of state, federal or local legislation (including referenda) that would expand, restrict, further tax, prevent or
negatively impact operations in or adjacent to the jurisdictions in which we do or seek to do business (such as a smoking ban at any of our facilities);

•

with respect to our Massachusetts project, the ultimate location and anticipated opening dates of our facility as well as the other
gaming facilities in the state;

•

the effects of local and national economic, credit, capital market, housing, and energy conditions on the economy in general and on
the gaming and lodging industries in particular;

•

the activities of our competitors and the rapid emergence of new competitors (traditional, internet and sweepstakes based and
taverns);

•

increases in the effective rate of taxation at any of our properties or at the corporate level;

•

our ability to identify attractive acquisition and development opportunities and to agree to terms with partners/municipalities for
such transactions;

•

the costs and risks involved in the pursuit of such opportunities and our ability to complete the acquisition or development of, and
achieve the expected returns from, such opportunities;

•

our expectations for the continued availability and cost of capital;

•

the outcome of pending legal proceedings;

•

changes in accounting standards;

•

our dependence on key personnel;

•

the impact of terrorism and other international hostilities;

•

the impact of cyber-attacks and other cyber security incidents;

•

the impact of weather; and

•

other factors as discussed in our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements
included in this document. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as
required by law. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this document may not occur.

PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

We are a leading, diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and pari-mutuel properties. The Company was
incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1982 as PNRC Corp. and adopted its current name in 1994, when the Company became a publicly traded company. In 1997, we began our transition from a pari-mutuel company
to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the Charles Town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in West Virginia. Since 1997, we have continued to expand our gaming
operations through strategic acquisitions, greenfield projects, and property expansions. We, along with our joint venture partner, opened Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway on February 3,
2012. In Ohio, we have opened four new gaming properties over the last three years, including: Hollywood Casino Toledo on May 29, 2012, Hollywood Casino Columbus on October 8, 2012,
Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway on August 28, 2014, and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course on September 17, 2014. In addition, on November 2, 2012, we acquired
Harrah's St. Louis, which we subsequently rebranded as Hollywood Casino St. Louis. Finally, we are in the process of constructing Plainridge Park Casino, an integrated racing and gaming
facility in Plainville, Massachusetts, which we expect to open in June 2015, as well as the Jamul development project near San Diego, California, which we anticipate completing in mid-2016.

We
believe that our portfolio of assets provides us the benefit of a geographically diversified cash flow from operations. We continue to expand our gaming operations through the
implementation and execution of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties, the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and the development of new gaming properties, particularly
in attractive regional markets.

In
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms "we," "us," "our," the "Company" and "Penn" refer to Penn National Gaming, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context
indicates otherwise.

Spin-Off of Real Estate Assets through a Real Estate Investment Trust

On November 1, 2013, the Company completed its plan to separate its gaming operating assets from its real property assets by
creating a newly formed, publicly traded real estate investment trust ("REIT"), known as Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. ("GLPI"), through a tax free spin-off (the "Spin-Off"). Penn
effected the Spin-Off by distributing one share of common stock of GLPI to the holders of Penn common stock and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series C Preferred Stock") for
every share of Penn common stock and every 1/1000th of a share of Series C Preferred Stock that they held at the close of business on October 16, 2013, the record date for the
Spin-Off. Peter M. Carlino and the PMC Delaware Dynasty Trust dated September 25, 2013, a trust for the benefit of Mr. Carlino's children, also received additional shares of GLPI common
stock, in exchange for shares of Penn common stock that they transferred to Penn immediately prior to the
Spin-Off, and Mr. Carlino exchanged certain options to acquire Penn common stock for options to acquire GLPI common stock having the same aggregate intrinsic value. Penn engaged in these
exchanges with Mr. Carlino and his related trust to ensure that each member of the Carlino family beneficially owns 9.9% or less of the outstanding shares of Penn common stock following the
Spin-Off, so that GLPI can qualify to be taxed as a REIT for United States ("U.S.") federal income tax purposes.

In
addition, through a series of internal corporate restructurings, Penn contributed to GLPI substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with Penn's real property
interests and real estate development business, as well as all of the assets and liabilities of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville, which are referred to as the "TRS
Properties." As a result of the Spin-Off, GLPI owns substantially all of Penn's former real property assets and leases back those assets (other than the TRS Properties) to Penn for use by its
subsidiaries, under a "triple net" master lease



agreement
(the "Master Lease") (which has a fifteen-year initial term that can be extended at Penn's option for up to four five-year renewal terms), as well as owns and operates the TRS Properties.
Penn continues to operate the leased gaming facilities and hold the associated gaming licenses with these facilities. As a result of the Spin-Off, the Company's results for the year ended
December 31, 2013 only include the TRS Properties for the period January 1, 2013 through October 31, 2013.

The
Company received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service relating to the tax treatment of the separation and the qualification of GLPI as a REIT. The private letter
ruling is subject to certain qualifications and based on certain representations and statements made by the Company and certain of its shareholders. If such representations and statements are untrue
or incomplete in any material respect (including as a result of a material change in the transaction or other relevant facts), the Company may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling. The
Company received opinions from outside counsel regarding certain aspects of the transaction that are not covered by the private letter ruling.

Prior
to the Spin-Off, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with GLPI setting forth the mechanics of the Spin-Off, certain organizational matters and other ongoing
obligations of the Company and GLPI. The Company and GLPI or their respective subsidiaries, as applicable, also entered into a number of other agreements prior to the Spin-Off to provide a framework
for the restructuring and for the relationships between GLPI and the Company.

Master Lease

As of December 31, 2014, the Company leased from GLPI real property assets associated with eighteen of the Company's gaming and
related facilities used in the Company's operations. Our two projects currently under development, Plainridge Park Casino and a Hollywood Casino branded facility with the Jamul Tribe, are not subject
to the Master Lease. The following summary of the Master Lease is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Master Lease attached hereto as Exhibit 10.20.

The
rent structure under the Master Lease, which became effective November 1, 2013, includes a fixed component, a portion of which is subject to an annual escalator of up to 2% if
certain rent coverage ratio thresholds are met, and a component that is based on the performance of the facilities, which is prospectively adjusted, subject to a floor of zero (i) every five
years by an amount equal to 4% of the average change to net revenues of all facilities under the Master Lease (other than Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo) during the preceding
five years, and (ii) monthly by an amount equal to 20% of the change in net revenues of Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo during the preceding month. In addition, with the
openings of Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course in the third quarter of 2014, these properties began paying rent subject to the terms of the Master
Lease, which had the impact of increasing our annual rental expense related to the Master Lease by approximately $19 million, which approximates ten percent of the real estate construction
costs paid for by GLPI related to these facilities.

In
April 2014, an amendment to the Master Lease was entered into in order to revise certain provisions relating to our Sioux City property. In accordance with the amendment, upon the
ceasing of gaming operations at Argosy Casino Sioux City on July 30, 2014 due to the termination of its gaming license, the annual rent payable to GLPI was reduced by $6.2 million.
Additionally, the Company finalized its calculation of rent coverage in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Master Lease to determine if an annual base rent escalator is due. The
calculation of the escalator resulted in an increase to our annual rent expense of $3.2 million starting November 1, 2014.

The
Master Lease is commonly known as a triple-net lease. Accordingly, in addition to rent, the Company is required to pay the following, among other things: (1) all facility
maintenance; (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased



properties;
(3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); and (4) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate
for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties.

At
the Company's option, the Master Lease may be extended for up to four five-year renewal terms beyond the initial fifteen-year term, on the same terms and conditions. If we elect to
renew the term of the Master Lease, the renewal will be effective as to all, but not less than all, of the leased property then subject to the Master Lease, provided that the final renewal option
shall only be exercisable with respect to certain of the barge-based facilities—i.e., facilities where barges serve as foundations upon which buildings are constructed to serve as
gaming or related facilities or serve ancillary purposes such as access platforms or shear barges to protect a gaming facility from floating debris—following an independent third party
expert's review of the total useful life of the applicable barged-based facility measured from the beginning of the initial term. If the final five-year renewal term would not cause the aggregate term
to exceed 80% of the useful life of such facility, the facility shall be included in the five-year renewal. In the event that a five-year renewal of such facility would cause it to exceed 80% of the
estimated useful life, such facility shall be included in the renewal for the period of time equal to but not exceeding 80% of the estimated useful life.

We
do not have the ability to terminate our obligations under the Master Lease prior to its expiration without GLPI's consent. If the Master Lease is terminated prior to its expiration
other than with GLPI's consent, we may be liable for damages and incur charges such as continued payment of rent through the end of the lease term and maintenance costs for the leased property.

Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") as that term is defined in Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting" ("ASC 280"), measures and assesses the Company's business performance based on regional
operations of various properties grouped together based primarily on their geographic locations. In January 2014, the Company named Jay Snowden as its Chief Operating Officer and the Company decided
in connection with this announcement to re-align its reporting structure. Starting in January 2014, the Company's reportable segments are: (i) East/Midwest, (ii) West, and
(iii) Southern Plains. See "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Item 8—Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data—Note 16—Segment Information."

The
East/Midwest reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, Hollywood Casino Bangor, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course,
Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, Hollywood Casino Toledo, which opened on May 29, 2012, Hollywood Casino Columbus, which opened on October 8, 2012, Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway,
which opened on August 28, 2014, and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course, which opened on September 17, 2014. It also includes the Company's Casino Rama management service
contract and the Plainville project in Massachusetts which the Company expects to open in June 2015. It also previously included Hollywood Casino Perryville, which was contributed to GLPI on
November 1, 2013.

The
West reportable segment consists of the following properties: Zia Park Casino and the M Resort, as well as the Jamul development project, which the Company anticipates
completing in mid-2016.

The
Southern Plains reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino Aurora, Hollywood Casino Joliet, Argosy Casino Alton, Argosy Casino Riverside, Hollywood
Casino Tunica, Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast (formerly Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis), Boomtown Biloxi, and Hollywood Casino St. Louis (formerly Harrah's St. Louis which was
acquired from Caesars



Entertainment
on November 2, 2012), and includes the Company's 50% investment in Kansas Entertainment, LLC ("Kansas Entertainment"), which owns the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway.
On July 30, 2014, the Company closed Argosy Casino Sioux City. This segment also previously included Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge, which was contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

The
Other category consists of the Company's standalone racing operations, namely Rosecroft Raceway, Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club, and the Company's joint venture interests in Sam Houston
Race Park, Valley Race Park, and Freehold Raceway, as well as the Company's 50% joint venture with the Cordish Companies in New York which we expect to dissolve in 2015. It also previously included
the Company's Bullwhackers property, which was sold in July 2013. If the Company is successful in obtaining gaming operations at these locations, they would be assigned to one of the Company's
reportable segments. The Other category also includes the Company's corporate overhead operations which does not meet the definition of an operating segment under ASC 280.

Properties

As of December 31, 2014, we owned, managed, or had ownership interests in twenty-six facilities in the following seventeen
jurisdictions: Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Ontario. The
Company, along with its joint venture partner, opened Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway on February 3, 2012. In Ohio, the Company opened four new gaming properties over the last three years,
including: Hollywood Casino Toledo on May 29, 2012, Hollywood Casino Columbus on October 8, 2012, Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway on August 28, 2014, and Hollywood Gaming at
Mahoning Valley Race Course on September 17, 2014. In addition, on November 2, 2012, the Company acquired Harrah's St. Louis, which we subsequently rebranded as Hollywood Casino
St. Louis. On July 30, 2014, the Company closed its facility in Sioux City, Iowa, and on July 1, 2013, the Company sold its Bullwhackers property located in Colorado. As such, the
Company no longer has any operations in Iowa and Colorado. Additionally, as a result of the Spin-Off, Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge in Louisiana and Hollywood Casino Perryville in Maryland were
contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

The
real estate of the leased properties described below was contributed to GLPI as part of the Spin-Off; however, Penn continues to operate the leased gaming facilities. The following

PTO.

Pursuant

Competition

The gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including
riverboat casinos, dockside casinos, land-based casinos, video lottery, gaming at taverns in certain states, such as Illinois as well as the potential legalization in Indiana and Pennsylvania,
sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming, emerging varieties of Internet gaming and other forms of gaming in the U.S. In a broader sense, our gaming operations
face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including: shopping; athletic events; television and movies; concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in
various forms throughout the U.S., in several Canadian provinces and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions,
including states adjacent to states in which we currently have facilities (such as in Ohio and Maryland), have legalized and recently expanded or will expand gaming in the near future. In addition,
established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations. New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons will
increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us. Finally, the imposition of smoking bans and/or higher gaming tax rates have a significant impact on our
properties' ability to compete with facilities in nearby jurisdictions.

Our
racing operations face significant competition for wagering dollars from other racetracks and OTWs, some of which also offer other forms of gaming, as well as other gaming venues
such as casinos. Additionally, for a number of years, there has been a general decline in the number of people
attending and wagering on live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives and unwillingness
of customers to travel a significant distance to racetracks. Our account wagering operations compete with other providers of such services throughout the country. We also may face competition in the
future from new OTWs, new racetracks, instant racing, or new providers of account wagering. From time to time, states consider legislation to permit other forms of gaming. If additional gaming
opportunities become available near our racing operations, such gaming opportunities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

East/Midwest.

On June 6, 2012, a casino complex opened at the Anne Arundel Mills mall in Anne Arundel, Maryland, with
approximately 3,200 slot
machines and significantly increased its slot machine offerings by mid-September 2012 to approximately 4,750 slot machines. In addition, the Anne Arundel facility opened table games on
April 11, 2013 and opened a 52 table poker room in late August 2013. The opening of this casino complex has and will continue to have a significant impact on the financial results of Hollywood
Casino at Charles Town Races and to a lesser extent Hollywood



Casino
at Penn National Race Course. However, the Horseshoe Baltimore Casino, which opened at the end of August 2014, has currently not had a significant negative impact on our operations at Charles
Town. However, it may negatively impact our operations there in 2015 as the new facility becomes more established. In May 2013, three different bidders, including the Company, submitted proposals for
a Prince George casino. In December 2013, the license for Prince George County was granted to MGM. The proposed $1.2 billion casino, which MGM plans to open in the second half of 2016, is
anticipated to adversely impact our financial results as it will create additional competition for Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races.

A
casino in Cincinnati, Ohio, which is the primary feeder market for our Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg property, opened on March 4, 2013 and has had and will continue to have an
adverse impact on Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg. We opened Hollywood Casino Toledo on May 29, 2012 and Hollywood Casino Columbus on October 8, 2012. Additionally, the State of Ohio
approved the placement of video lottery terminals at the state's seven racetracks. On June 1, 2012, a new racino at Scioto Downs in Columbus, Ohio opened, which has had a negative impact on
Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg's financial results and competes aggressively in the same market as Hollywood Casino Columbus. In addition, a new racino at Miami Valley Gaming (formerly known as Lebanon
Raceway) opened in mid-December 2013, and a racino at Belterra Park (formerly known as River Downs) opened in May 2014. Both of these racinos compete with Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg. Conversely, we
have opened our own racinos in Ohio, with Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway opening on August 28, 2014 and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course opening on September 17, 2014.
As a result, in a relatively short period of time, Ohio has gone from having no gaming facilities to having four casinos and seven video lottery terminal facilities. In addition, we continue to fight
illegal gaming operations, such as internet sweepstakes.

In
addition, legislators in Kentucky are currently considering gaming legislation. The commencement of gaming in Kentucky would negatively impact certain of our existing properties in
the East/Midwest segment. Finally, Indiana and Pennsylvania are considering the potential legalization of gaming at taverns.

West.

Our West segment contains our M Resort property which caters to the Las Vegas locals market. The strength of the Las Vegas locals
market is
partially linked to the health of the Las Vegas strip. Weakness in this market may negatively impact the Las Vegas locals market, including our M Resort property.

Southern Plains.

In Illinois, there have been perennial gaming expansion proposals introduced in the legislature, which we expect to
continue.
Additionally, in July 2011, the Illinois Supreme Court, in a unanimous ruling, cleared the way for the 2009 Illinois Video Gaming Act to go forward, which authorized a limited number of video gaming
terminals in licensed bars and taverns across Illinois, subject to host community approval. In October 2012, video gambling in Illinois was officially launched with the first locations being allowed
to operate video gaming terminals. Currently, there are over 19,000 terminals at numerous locations throughout the state, which has had a negative impact on our casinos near or in Illinois. In
addition, legislators in Nebraska are currently considering gaming legislation. The commencement of gaming in Nebraska or the expansion of gaming in Illinois would negatively impact certain of our
existing properties in the Southern Plains segment.

In
Kansas, the legislature approved the expansion of casino gaming in its state, and on February 3, 2012, Kansas Entertainment, a joint venture of affiliates of International
Speedway and us, opened the facility, which is located approximately 17 miles from Argosy Casino Riverside. The opening of this casino has had a negative impact on the financial results of Argosy
Casino Riverside due to their close proximity to one another. In the Mississippi Gulf Coast market, a casino in Biloxi opened in late May 2012, which has had an adverse effect on the financial results
of our Boomtown Biloxi property.



U.S. and Foreign Revenues

Our net revenues in the U.S. for 2014, 2013, and 2012 were approximately $2,578.8 million, $2,905.6 million, and
$2,884.7 million, respectively. Our revenues from operations in Canada for 2014, 2013, and 2012 were approximately $11.7 million, $13.2 million, and $14.8 million,
respectively.

Governmental Regulations

The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our
operations. Each of our facilities is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern
the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction
could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on

CSOA's agreement has been extended through December 31, 2020 with certain termination provisions. The MSBA agreement has been extended through December 31, 2020. Additionally, Rosecroft
Raceway has entered into agreements with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union ("UFCW") Local 27 and the Seafarers Entertainment and Allied Trade Union ("SEATU") for certain bargaining
positions at the racetrack. The UFCW Local 27 agreement was ratified on December 13, 2014 and expires on November 30, 2019. The SEATU agreement expires on November 30, 2020.

Across
certain of the Company's properties, SEATU represents approximately 1,280 of the Company's employees under agreements that expire at various times between November 2015 and May
2022. At Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg and Argosy Casino Riverside, the SEATU agreements expired in June 2014 and October 2013, respectively, and both have been extended on a monthly basis while
negotiations are in process. At Hollywood Casino Joliet, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union Local 1 represents approximately 191 employees under a collective bargaining agreement which
expires on March 31, 2015. At Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo, a council comprised of the United Auto Workers and the United Steel Workers represents approximately 1,321
employees under a collective bargaining agreement which ends on November 15, 2019. In addition, at some of the Company's properties, the Security Police and Fire Professionals of America, the
International Brotherhood of Electronic Workers Locals 176 and 649, the LIUNA Public Serviced Employees Local 1290PE, and the United Industrial, Service, Transportation, Professional and Government
Workers of North America represent certain of the Company's employees under collective bargaining agreements that expire at various times between June 2015 and September 2025. None of these additional
unions represent more than 85 of the Company's employees.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Business

We face significant competition from other gaming and entertainment operations.

The gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including
riverboat casinos, dockside casinos, land-based casinos, video lottery, gaming at taverns in certain states, such as Illinois as well as the potential legalization in Indiana and Pennsylvania,
sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming and other forms of gaming in the U.S. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, and other internet
wagering services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings, could divert customers from our
properties and thus adversely affect our business. Such internet wagering services are often illegal under federal law but operate from overseas locations, and are nevertheless sometimes accessible to
domestic gamblers. Currently, there are proposals that would legalize internet poker and other varieties of internet gaming in a number of states and at the federal level. Several states, such as
Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware, have enacted legislation authorizing intrastate internet gaming and internet gaming operations have begun in these states. Expansion of internet gaming in other
jurisdictions (both legal and illegal) could further compete with our traditional operations, which could have an adverse impact on our business and result of operations.

In
a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including: shopping; athletic events; television and movies; concerts;
and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S., in several Canadian provinces and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native
Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have facilities (such as in Ohio and Maryland), have recently legalized and implemented
gaming. In addition, established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations. New, relocated or expanded operations
by other persons could increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us.

Gaming
competition is intense in most of the markets where we operate. Recently, there has been additional significant competition in our markets as a result of the upgrading or
expansion of facilities by existing market participants, the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes. As competing properties and new markets are opened, our operating
results may be negatively impacted. For example, new casinos and racinos have opened recently that compete in the same market as our Lawrenceburg property; there is increased competition to our
Charles Town property from the opening of the casino complex at the Arundel Mills mall in Anne Arundel, Maryland in June 2012 and its addition of table games in the spring of 2013; the opening of
Horseshoe Baltimore Casino in Baltimore, Maryland in 2014 and the expected opening of a casino at National Harbor in Prince George's County, Maryland are competing with our Hollywood Casino at Charles
Town Races and to a lesser extent, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course; the opening of our joint venture casino project in Kansas in February 2012 which impacted Argosy Casino Riverside; and
a casino that opened in July 2011 in Des Plaines, Illinois which negatively impacted our Hollywood Casino Aurora and Hollywood Casino Joliet properties. Hollywood Casino Aurora and Hollywood Casino
Joliet have also been negatively impacted by the proliferation of gaming terminals at numerous locations throughout the state which are in the vicinity of our operations. In addition, some of our
direct competitors in certain markets may have superior facilities and/or operating conditions. We expect each existing or
future market in which we participate to be highly competitive. The competitive position of each of our casino properties is discussed in detail in the subsection entitled "Competition" of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.



We may face disruption and other difficulties in integrating and managing facilities we have
recently developed or acquired, or may develop or acquire in the future.

We expect to continue pursuing expansion opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for acquisition and development of new
properties, which evaluations may include discussions and the review of confidential information after the execution of nondisclosure agreements with potential acquisition candidates, some of which
may be potentially significant in relation to our size.

We
could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our expanded or combined operations and any other properties we may develop or acquire, particularly in new competitive
markets. The integration of properties we may develop or acquire will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business. The process of
integrating properties that we may acquire also could interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, the development of new properties may involve construction, local opposition, regulatory, legal and competitive risks as well as the risks attendant to partnership deals on
these development opportunities. In particular, in projects where we team up with a joint venture partner, if we cannot reach agreement with such partners, or our relationships otherwise deteriorate,
we could face significant increased costs and delays. Local opposition can delay or increase the anticipated cost of a project. Finally, given the competitive nature of these types of limited license
opportunities, litigation is possible.

Management
of new properties, especially in new geographic areas (such as our 2015 opening in Plainridge, Massachusetts), may require that we increase our management resources. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or development projects. We also cannot assure you that if
acquisitions are completed, that the acquired businesses will generate returns consistent with our expectations.

Our
ability to achieve our objectives in connection with any acquisition we may consummate may be highly dependent on, among other things, our ability to retain the senior level property
management
teams of such acquisition candidates. If, for any reason, we are unable to retain these management teams following such acquisitions or if we fail to attract new capable executives, our operations
after consummation of such acquisitions could be materially adversely affected.

The
occurrence of some or all of the above described events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may face risks related to our ability to receive regulatory approvals required to complete, or
other delays or impediments to completing certain of our acquisitions.

Our growth is fueled, in part, by the acquisition of existing gaming, racing, and development properties. In addition to standard
closing conditions, our acquisitions are often conditioned on the receipt of regulatory approvals and other hurdles that create uncertainty and could increase costs. Such delays could significantly
reduce the benefits to us of such acquisitions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We face a number of challenges prior to opening new or upgraded gaming facilities.

No assurance can be given that, when we endeavor to open new or upgraded gaming facilities, the expected timetables for opening such
facilities will be met in light of the uncertainties inherent in the development of the regulatory framework, construction, the licensing process, legislative action and litigation. Delays in opening
new or upgraded facilities could lead to increased costs and delays in receiving anticipated revenues with respect to such facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.



A deterioration of our relationship with the Jamul Indian Village (the "Jamul Tribe") could cause
delay or termination of the proposed development project in San Diego County and prevent or significantly impede recovery of our investment therein or in any future development projects.

Good personal and professional relationships with the Jamul Tribe and its officials are critical to our proposed gaming operations and
activities in San Diego County, including our ability to obtain, develop, execute management agreements and maintain other agreements. As a sovereign nation, the Jamul Tribe establishes its own
governmental systems under which tribal officials or bodies representing the Jamul Tribe may be replaced by appointment or election or become subject to policy changes. Replacements of tribal
officials or administrations, changes in policies to which the Jamul Tribe are subject, or other factors that may lead to the deterioration of our relationship with the Jamul Tribe may lead to
termination of our proposed management agreement with the Jamul Tribe, which may have an adverse effect on the future results of our operations.

In
addition, we have made, and may continue to make, substantial loans to the Jamul Tribe for the construction, development, equipment and operations of the proposed development in San
Diego County. It is possible that no third party funding is secured prior to the facility opening. Our only material recourse for collection of indebtedness from the Jamul Tribe or for money damages
for breach or wrongful termination of a management, development, consulting or financing agreement is from revenues, if any, from casino operations.

We lease a substantial number of our properties and financial, operational, regulatory or other
potential challenges of our lessor may adversely impair our operations.

We lease a substantial number of the properties that we operate and manage from GLPI under the Master Lease. If GLPI has financial,
operational, regulatory or other challenges there can be no assurance that GLPI will be able to comply with its obligations under its agreements with us.

We are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent under the Master Lease, which
could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.

We are required to pay more than half of our cash flow from operations to GLPI pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of
the Master Lease. As a result of our current significantly reduced cash flow, our ability to fund our own operations or development projects,
raise capital, make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, our obligations under the Master Lease may:

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;

•

increase our vulnerability to general or regional adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments, thereby reducing the
availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and

•

restrict our ability to raise capital, make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions.

Any
of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Substantially all of our gaming and racing facilities are leased and could experience risks
associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with GLPI, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position or results of operations.

We lease 18 of the gaming and racing facilities we operate pursuant to the Master Lease (including the two properties recently
completed in Dayton, Ohio and Mahoning Valley, Ohio). The Master Lease provides that GLPI may terminate the lease for a number of reasons, including, subject to applicable cure periods, the default in
any payment of rent, taxes or other payment obligations or the breach of any other covenant or agreement in the lease. Termination of the Master Lease could result in a default under our debt
agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. Moreover, since as a lessee we do not completely control the land and improvements
underlying our operations, GLPI as lessor could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the facilities leased under the Master Lease which are beyond our control. If GLPI chose to disrupt our
use either permanently or for a significant period of time, then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected. There can also be no assurance
that we will be able to comply with our obligations under the Master Lease in the future.

The
Master Lease is commonly known as a triple-net lease. Accordingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay among other things the following: (1) all facility maintenance,
(2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties
(other than taxes on the income of the lessor) and (4) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties.
We are responsible for incurring the costs described in the preceding sentence notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall in part accrue to GLPI as
owner of the associated facilities. In addition, if some of our leased facilities should prove to be unprofitable, we could remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the Master
Lease even if we decided to withdraw from those locations. We could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including lease termination costs, impairment charges and other
special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may face reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn.

Our net revenues are highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at properties we manage and as such our business
has been adversely impacted by economic downturns. Decreases in discretionary consumer spending brought about by weakened general economic conditions such as, but not limited to, lackluster recoveries
from recessions, high unemployment levels, higher income taxes, low levels of consumer confidence, weakness in the housing market, cultural and demographic changes, and increased stock market
volatility may negatively impact our revenues and operating cash flow.

We are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could
impact our financial condition.

From time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits relating to matters incidental to our business. The nature of our business
subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business. As with all litigation, no assurance
can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and, in general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or
damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations (see, for example, the lawsuits described in Item 3 below).



We face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities.

Licensing requirements.

As managers of gaming and pari-mutuel wagering facilities, we are subject to extensive state, local and, in
Canada,
provincial regulation. State, local and provincial authorities require us and our subsidiaries to demonstrate suitability to obtain and retain various licenses and require that we have registrations,
permits and approvals to conduct gaming operations. These regulatory authorities have broad discretion, and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit,
condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations or prevent us from owning the securities of any of our gaming subsidiaries or prevent another person
from owning an equity interest in us. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the
suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals. Regulatory authorities have input into our
operations, for instance, hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of machines. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the
assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We
have demonstrated suitability to obtain and have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for us to operate our existing gaming and
pari-mutuel facilities. We can give no assurance to you that we will be able to retain those existing licenses (for example the recent events in Iowa) or demonstrate suitability to obtain any new
licenses, registrations, permits or approvals. In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another
jurisdiction. As we expand our gaming operations in our existing jurisdictions or to new areas, we may have to meet additional suitability requirements and obtain additional licenses, registrations,
permits and approvals from gaming authorities in these jurisdictions. The approval process can be time-consuming and costly and we cannot be sure that we will be successful.

Gaming
authorities in the U.S. generally can require that any beneficial owner of our securities file an application for a finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record
or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must generally apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by
the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate such an owner's suitability and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the
owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities.

In
addition, our proposed development project with the Jamul Tribe near San Diego would be subject to the oversight of the National Indian Gaming Commission, which administers the Indian
Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 with respect to the terms and conditions of management contracts and the operation of casinos and all gaming on land held in trust for Native American tribes in the U.S.

Potential changes in legislation and regulation of our operations.

Regulations governing the conduct of gaming activities and the
obligations of
gaming companies in any jurisdiction in which we have or in the future may have gaming operations are subject to change and could impose additional operating, financial or other burdens on the way we
conduct our business.

Moreover,
legislation to prohibit, limit or add burdens to our business may be introduced in the future in states where gaming has been legalized. In addition, from time to time,
legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions
in which we operate. Any expansion of gaming or restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations or enactment of other adverse regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results. For example, in October 2005, the Illinois House of Representatives voted to approve proposed legislation that would eliminate riverboat



gambling.
If the Illinois Senate had passed that bill, our business would have been materially impacted. The passage of the Smoke Free Illinois Act, which became effective January 1, 2008 and
bans smoking in casinos, has adversely affected revenues and operating results at our Illinois properties. In Pennsylvania, we are currently permitted to allow smoking on only up to 50% of the gaming
floor of our Grantville facility and smoking is banned in all other indoor areas. Additionally, on July 1, 2012, a state statute in Indiana became effective that imposes a state wide smoking
ban in specified businesses, buildings, public places and other specified locations. The statute specifically exempts riverboat casinos, and all other gaming facilities in Indiana, from the smoking
ban. However, the statute allows local government to enact a more restrictive smoking ban than the state statute and also leaves in place any more restrictive local legislation that exists as of the
effective date of the statute. To date, our facility in Lawrenceburg, Indiana is not subject to any such local legislation. If additional smoking bans are enacted within jurisdictions where we operate
or seek to do business, our business could be adversely affected.

Taxation and fees.

We believe that the prospect of significant revenue is one of the primary reasons that jurisdictions permit
legalized gaming. As a
result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant revenue based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, local and provincial income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject
to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in
tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues
through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if
adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected
budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes, and worsening
economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.

Compliance with other laws.

We are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental,
construction and
land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages. If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money
laundering laws or regulations, or any accusations of money laundering or regulatory investigations into possible money laundering activities, by any of our properties, employees or customers could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We have two properties that each generated 10% or more of our net revenues.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had two facilities—one in Charles Town, West Virginia and one in
Grantville, Pennsylvania—that each generated approximately 10% or more of our net revenues. Our ability to meet our operating and debt service requirements is dependent, in part, upon the
continued success of these facilities. The operations at these facilities and any of our other facilities could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including those described in these "Risk
Factors" as well as more specifically those described below:

•

risks related to local and regional economic and competitive conditions, such as a decline in the number of visitors to a facility, a
downturn in the overall economy in the market, a decrease in consumer spending on gaming activities in the market or an increase in competition within and outside the state in which each property is
located (for example, the effect on our Charles Town and, to a lesser extent, Grantville casinos due to the casino complex at the Arundel Mills mall in



Anne
Arundel, Maryland which opened on June 6, 2012 and added table games in the spring of 2013, and the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore Casino in Baltimore, Maryland in August 2014 and expected
opening of a casino at National Harbor in Prince George's County, Maryland in the second half of 2016);

•

changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations (including changes in laws and regulations affecting gaming operations
and taxes) applicable to a facility;

•

impeded access to a facility due to weather, road construction or closures of primary access
routes;

•

work stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems as well as issues arising in connection with agreements with horsemen and
pari-mutuel clerks; and

•

the occurrence of natural disasters or other adverse regional weather trends.

In
addition, although to a lesser extent than our facilities in Charles Town, West Virginia and Grantville, Pennsylvania, we anticipate meaningful contributions from Hollywood Casino
St. Louis and following the relocation of our two racetracks in Ohio in the third quarter of 2014, we now have four gaming facilities in the state of Ohio. Therefore, our results will be
dependent on the regional economies and competitive landscapes at these locations as well.

We depend on our key personnel.

We are highly dependent on the services of our executive management team and other members of our senior management team. In 2013, in
connection with the Spin-Off, we experienced some turnover, including the resignation of Peter M. Carlino from his position as our Chief Executive Officer (although he retained his position as
Chairman of the Board). We have promoted various individuals (including our current CEO and COO) as well as hired executives from outside the gaming industry to fill these positions. Our ability to
attract and retain key personnel is affected by the competitiveness of our compensation packages and the other terms and conditions of employment, our continued ability to compete effectively against
other gaming companies and our growth prospects. The loss of the services of any members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

It is unclear what impact our new business structure, which has no precedent within the gaming
industry, will have on our key business relationships and our ability to compete with other gaming operators.

As a result of the completed Spin-Off, we were the first gaming operator that leases the majority of its properties from a single
lessor under a master lease arrangement. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether and to what extent our relationship with GLPI, including any actual or perceived conflicts of interest on the
part of our overlapping directors, will affect our relationships with suppliers, customers, regulators and our ability to compete with other gaming operators that are not subject to a master lease
arrangement with a single lessor.

Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in
additional expenses and compliance risks.

Changing laws and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including SEC regulations, generally accepted
accounting principles, and NASDAQ Global Select Market rules, are creating uncertainty for companies. These changing laws and regulations are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to
their lack of specificity, recent issuance and/or lack of guidance. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. In
addition, further regulation of financial institutions and public companies is possible. This could result in continuing uncertainty and higher costs regarding compliance matters. Due to our
commitment to maintain high standards of compliance with laws and public disclosure, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in and are



likely
to continue to result in increased general and administrative expense. In addition, we are subject to different parties' interpretation of our compliance with these new and changing laws and
regulations. A failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could have a materially adverse effect on us. For instance, if our gaming authorities, the SEC, our independent auditors or our
shareholders and potential shareholders conclude that our compliance with the regulations is unsatisfactory, this may result in a negative public perception of us, subject us to increased regulatory
scrutiny, monetary penalties or otherwise adversely affect us.

Inclement weather and other casualty events could seriously disrupt our business and have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The operations of our facilities are subject to disruptions or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions, natural
disasters and other casualty events. Because many of our gaming operations are located on or adjacent to bodies of water, these facilities are subject to risks in addition to those associated with
land-based casinos, including loss of service due to casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, flood, hurricane or other severe weather conditions. For
example, in late August 2005, we closed Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, Boomtown Biloxi in Biloxi, Mississippi and Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge in Baton
Rouge, Louisiana in anticipation of Hurricane Katrina. Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge subsequently reopened on August 30, 2005. However, due to the extensive damage sustained, operations at
Boomtown Biloxi and Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis did not resume until June 29, 2006 and August 31, 2006, respectively. Many of our casinos operate in areas which are subject to
periodic flooding that has caused us to experience decreased attendance and increased operating expenses. Any flood or other severe weather condition could lead to the loss of use of a casino facility
for an extended period. For instance, Hollywood Casino Tunica was closed from May 1, 2011 to May 25, 2011 due to flooding. In terms of casualty events, on March 20, 2009, our
Hollywood Casino Joliet was closed following a fire that started in the land-based pavilion at the facility. On June 25, 2009, the casino barge reopened with temporary land-based facilities,
and we began construction of a new land-based pavilion, which opened in late December 2010. In addition, on May 31, 2013, Hollywood Casino St. Louis sustained damage as a result of a
tornado and was forced to close for approximately fourteen hours. Most recently, we closed Hollywood Casino Toledo for three days in 2014 and for one day in 2015 due to snow and extreme cold
temperatures. Even if adverse weather conditions do not require the closure of our facilities, those conditions make it more difficult for our customers to reach our properties, which can have an
adverse impact on our operations.

The extent to which we can recover under our insurance policies for damages sustained at our
properties in the event of future inclement weather and other casualty events could adversely affect our business.

We maintain significant property insurance, including business interruption coverage, for these and other properties. However, there
can be no assurances that we will be fully or promptly compensated for losses at any of our facilities in the event of future inclement weather or casualty events. In addition, our property insurance
coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected and actual replacement cost of rebuilding certain facilities "as was" if there was a total loss. The Master Lease requires us,
in the event of a casualty event, to rebuild a leased property to substantially the same condition as existed immediately before such casualty event. We renew our insurance policies (other than our
builder's risk insurance) on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so material that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain
exclusions from our coverage.



Our gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical
power. Our security systems and all of our slot machines are controlled by computers and reliant on electrical power to operate.

Any unscheduled disruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power could result in an immediate,
and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our gaming operations. Such interruptions may occur as a result of, for example, a failure of our information technology or related
systems, catastrophic events or rolling blackouts. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer
viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.

Our operations in certain jurisdictions depend on management agreements and/or leases with third
parties and local governments.

Our operations in several jurisdictions depend on land leases and/or management and development agreements with third parties and local
governments. If we, or if GLPI in the case of leases pursuant to which we are the sub-lessee, are unable to renew these leases and agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire, our business may be
disrupted and, in the event of disruptions in multiple jurisdictions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in Iowa, each gaming
license is issued jointly to a gaming operator and a local charitable organization ("QSO"). The agreement between our gaming operator subsidiary in Iowa, Belle of Sioux City, L.P. ("Belle"),
and its local QSO, Missouri River Historical Development, Inc. ("MRHD"), expired in early July 2012. An extension agreement with MRHD through March 2015 was signed by both parties; however, the
validity of this agreement is currently the subject of litigation. Furthermore, in April 2013, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission ("IRGC") awarded a new gaming license to operate a land-based
casino in Woodbury County to Sioux City Entertainment ("SCE") and SCE opened a Hard Rock branded casino on August 1, 2014. Belle challenged the denial of its gaming license renewal, which is
still pending, however, on July 30, 2014, Argosy Casino Sioux City was ordered to close.

Similarly,
in the Province of Ontario, through CHC Casinos, our indirectly wholly owned subsidiary, we manage Casino Rama, a full service gaming and entertainment facility, on behalf of
the OLGC, an agency of the Province of Ontario. In June 2014, we signed an agreement to extend the management
agreement for Casino Rama on a month-to-month basis with a 60-day notice period for up to a maximum period of forty-eight months. No assurance can be given as to how long the OLGC will continue to
engage us to manage the property.

We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions
and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for
corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions. From time to time, we have incurred and are incurring costs and obligations for correcting environmental
noncompliance matters. To date, none of these matters have had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such
matters will not have such an effect in the future.

We
also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and
regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the
owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly,
may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent property. Under our contractual arrangements with GLPI,



including
the Master Lease, we will generally be responsible for both past and future environmental liabilities associated with our gaming operations, notwithstanding ownership of the underlying real
property having been transferred to GLPI. Furthermore, we are aware that there is or may have been soil or groundwater contamination at certain of our properties resulting from current or former
operations. Additionally, certain of the gaming chips used at many gaming properties, including some of ours, have been found to contain some level of lead. Analysis by third parties has indicated the
normal handling of the chips does not create a health hazard. We have disposed of a majority of these gaming chips. To date, none of these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws has
had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future.

The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional
costs on us.

A majority of our revenues are attributable to slot machines and related systems operated by us at our gaming facilities. It is
important, for competitive reasons, that we offer the most popular and up to date slot machine games with the latest technology to our customers.

A
substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive recent consolidation activity
within the gaming equipment sector, including the recent acquisitions of Multimedia Games, Inc. by Global Cash Access, Bally Technologies, Inc. by Scientific Games Corporation,
International Gaming Technologies by GTECH Holdings and previous acquisitions of WMS Industries Inc. by Scientific Games Corporation, which closed in October 2013, and the acquisition of SHFL
Entertainment, Inc. by Bally Technologies, Inc. which closed in November 2013.

In
recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participation lease arrangements in order to
acquire the machines. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net
win. Generally, a participation lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.

For
competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the
continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participation lease costs, it
could hurt our profitability.

We depend on agreements with our horsemen and pari-mutuel clerks.

The Federal Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978, as amended, the West Virginia Race Horse Industry Reform Act and the Pennsylvania
Racing Act require that, in order to simulcast races, we have certain agreements with the horse owners and trainers at our West Virginia and Pennsylvania racetracks. In addition, West Virginia
requires applicants seeking to renew their gaming license to demonstrate they have an agreement regarding the proceeds of the gaming machines with a representative of a majority of the horse owners
and trainers, a representative of a majority of the pari-mutuel clerks and a representative of a majority of the horse breeders.

At
Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, we have an agreement with the Charles Town Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association that expired on December 31, 2013 and has
been extended on a month-to-month basis while negotiations are in progress. Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races also has an agreement with the breeders that expires on June 30, 2015.
Additionally, the pari-mutuel clerks at Charles Town are represented under a collective bargaining agreement with the West Virginia Union of Mutuel Clerks, which expired on December 31, 2010
and has been extended on a month-to-month basis while negotiations are in process.



Our
agreement with the Pennsylvania Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course expires on January 31, 2016. We had a
collective bargaining agreement with Local 137 of the Sports Arena Employees at Penn National Race Course with respect to on-track pari-mutuel clerks and admissions personnel which expired on
December 31, 2011. In August 2012, Local 137 of the Sports Arena Employees announced that they entered into a "voluntary supervision" agreement with their international union, LIUNA Local 108.
In February 2014, a new agreement with LIUNA Local 108 for on-track and OTWs bargaining units was ratified for three years.

Our
agreement with the Maine Harness Horsemen Association at Bangor Raceway continues through the conclusion of the 2015 racing season. In March of 2014, Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning
Valley Race Course entered into an agreement with the Ohio Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association. The term is for a period of ten years from the September 2014 commencement of video lottery
terminal operations at that facility. The Company's agreement with the Ohio Harness Horsemen's Association for racing at Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway expired on December 31, 2014 but is
still in effect pending the ongoing negotiations of a successor agreement. Rosecroft Raceway entered into agreements with the CSOA and MSBA as of July 5, 2011. CSOA's agreement has been
extended through December 31, 2020 with certain termination provisions. The MSBA agreement has been extended through December 31, 2020. Additionally, Rosecroft Raceway has entered into
agreements with the UFCW Local 27 and the SEATU for certain bargaining positions at the racetrack. The UFCW Local 27 agreement was ratified on December 13, 2014 and expires on
November 30, 2019. The SEATU agreement expires on November 30, 2020.

If
we fail to present evidence of an agreement with the horsemen at a track, we will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting at that track and OTWs
and, in West Virginia, our video lottery license may not be renewed. In addition, our simulcasting agreements are subject to the horsemen's approval. If we fail to renew or modify existing agreements
on satisfactory terms, this failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Work stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future
profits.

Some of our employees are currently represented by labor unions. A lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino
properties or construction projects could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Given the large number of employees, labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit
more employees in the gaming industry. In addition, organized labor may benefit from new legislation or legal interpretations by the current presidential administration. Particularly, in light of
current support for changes to federal and state labor laws, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future.

Our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including
misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.

We rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit customers' personal and financial information, credit card
settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information. We have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers' confidential personal information. However, our
information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use
by customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems
could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results.

Further,
as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may incur significant costs in our attempts to modify or enhance our protective measures or investigate or remediate any vulnerability.



Risks Related to the Spin-Off

If the Spin-Off, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that
is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to significant tax liabilities.

We received a private letter ruling (the "IRS Ruling") from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the Spin-Off,
together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The IRS Ruling does not address certain requirements for tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off under Section 355, and we received from our tax
advisors a tax opinion substantially to the effect that, with respect to such requirements on which the IRS will not rule, such requirements will be satisfied. The IRS Ruling, and the tax opinions
that we expect to receive from our tax advisors, relied on and will rely on, among other things, certain representations, assumptions and undertakings, including those relating to the past and future
conduct of GLPI's business, and the IRS Ruling and the opinions would not be valid if such representations, assumptions and undertakings were incorrect in any material respect.

Notwithstanding
the IRS Ruling and the tax opinions, the IRS could determine the Spin-Off should be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines
any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the IRS Ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions
that are not covered by the IRS Ruling.

If
the Spin-Off fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, in general, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the GLPI common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value.

Under
the tax matters agreement that GLPI entered into with us, GLPI generally is required to indemnify us against any tax resulting from the Spin-Off to the extent that such tax
resulted from (1) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of GLPI, whether by merger or otherwise, (2) other actions or failures to act by GLPI, or
(3) any of GLPI's representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated. GLPI's indemnification obligations to Penn and its subsidiaries, officers and directors will not be limited by any
maximum amount. If GLPI is required to indemnify Penn or such other persons under the circumstance set forth in the tax matters agreement, GLPI may be subject to substantial liabilities and there can
be no assurance that GLPI will be able to satisfy such indemnification obligations.

Our historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of future results.

The historical financial statements included in our previous SEC filings prior to the Spin-Off do not reflect what our business,
financial position or results of operations will be in the future. In connection with the Spin-Off, significant changes have occurred in our cost structure, financing and business operations as a
result of our operation as a stand-alone company separate from GLPI and our entering into transactions with GLPI and its subsidiaries that have not existed historically, including the Master Lease.

Peter M. Carlino, our Chairman, and David A. Handler, one of our directors, may have actual or
potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at GLPI.

Peter M. Carlino serves as our Chairman and as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GLPI. In addition, David A. Handler, one of
our directors, is also a director of GLPI. While we have procedures in place to address such situations, these overlapping positions could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest
when our or GLPI's management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities, such as greenfield development opportunities or potential acquisition targets, or face decisions that could have
different implications for us and GLPI. Further, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and GLPI (or its subsidiaries) regarding the
terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship, such as pursuant to



the
Master Lease, thereafter between us and GLPI. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and GLPI enter into any commercial or other adverse arrangements with each other in the future.

The Spin-Off could give rise to disputes or other unfavorable effects, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

Disputes with third parties could arise out of the Spin-Off, and we could experience unfavorable reactions to the Spin-Off from
employees, shareholders, lenders, ratings agencies, regulators or other interested parties. These disputes and reactions of third parties could lead to additional legal proceedings being instituted
against us and those lawsuits could result in settlements or liability for damages which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. In addition,
disputes between us and GLPI and its subsidiaries could arise in connection with any of the agreements that we entered into with GLPI in connection with the Spin-Off, including the Master Lease, a
separation and distribution agreement (the "separation and distribution agreement"), a tax matters agreement, a transition services agreement or other agreements.

In connection with the Spin-Off, GLPI agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there
can be no assurance that these indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that GLPI's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be
impaired in the future

.

Pursuant
to the separation and distribution agreement, GLPI has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us
responsible for any of the liabilities that GLPI agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that GLPI will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we
ultimately succeed in recovering from GLPI any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from GLPI.

A court could deem the distribution in the Spin-Off to be a fraudulent conveyance and void the
transaction or impose substantial liabilities upon us.

If the transaction is challenged by a third party, a court could deem the distribution of GLPI common shares or certain internal
restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the Spin-Off to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or
obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor
was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. In such circumstances, a court could void the transactions or impose
substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. Among other things, the court could require our shareholders to return to us some
or all of the shares of our common stock issued in the distribution or require us to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the restructuring transactions for the benefit of
creditors. Whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the laws of the applicable jurisdiction.

If we and GLPI are treated by the IRS as being under common control, both we and GLPI could
experience adverse tax consequences.

If we and GLPI are treated by the IRS as being under common control, the IRS will be authorized to reallocate income and deductions
between us and GLPI to reflect arm's length terms. If the IRS were to successfully establish that rents paid by us to GLPI are excessive, (1) we would be denied a deduction for the excessive
portion and (2) we would be subject to a penalty on the portion deemed excessive, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of
operations. In addition, our shareholders would be deemed to have received a distribution that was then contributed to the capital of GLPI.



Risks Related to Our Capital Structure

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from
fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.

We incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, as well as a significant fixed annual rental payment to GLPI, in connection with the
Spin-Off. Our substantial indebtedness and additional fixed costs via our rental obligation could have important consequences to our financial health. For example, it
could:

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;

•

limit our ability to participate in multiple or large development projects, absent additional third party financing;

•

increase our vulnerability to general or regional adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to satisfy our rental obligation and debt service,
thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly
leveraged;

•

limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow
additional funds; and

•

result in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and
other restrictive covenants contained in our debt instruments, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to
foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt.

Any
of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The terms of the debt incurred in connection with the
Spin-Off do not, and any future debt may not, fully prohibit us from incurring additional debt, including debt related to facilities we develop or acquire. If new debt is added to our current debt
levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.

Volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the global
economy may negatively impact our revenues and our ability to access favorable financing terms.

While we intend to finance expansion and renovation projects with existing cash, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our
senior secured credit facility, we may require additional financing to support our continued growth. However, depending on then current economic or capital market conditions, our access to capital may
not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Further, if adverse regional and national economic conditions persist or worsen, we could experience decreased revenues from our operations
attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness. Finally, our
borrowing costs under our senior secured credit facility are tied to LIBOR. We currently have no hedges in place to mitigate the impact of higher LIBOR rates and as such significant increases in LIBOR
could have a negative impact on our results of operations.

The availability and cost of financing could have an adverse effect on business.

We intend to finance some of our current and future expansion, development and renovation projects and acquisitions with cash flow from
operations, borrowings under our senior secured credit



facility
and equity or debt financings. In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into approximately $1,550 million of new debt financing, which includes a five year revolving credit facility
with a borrowing capacity of $500 million, a five year $500 million Term Loan A facility and a seven year $250 million Term Loan B facility under our senior secured credit
facility and $300 million of 5.875% senior unsecured notes. In addition, following the Spin-Off, we are required by the Master Lease to, in the case of certain expansion projects, or may
choose, in the case of other development projects, to provide GLPI the right to provide the financing needed for such purposes. Depending on the state of the credit markets, if we are unable to
finance our current or future projects, we could have to seek alternative financing, such as through selling assets, restructuring debt, increasing our reliance on equity financing or seeking
additional joint venture partners. Depending on credit market conditions, alternative sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion, development and/or renovation, or such other
financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our existing indebtedness contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If we
are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to limit or suspend expansion, development and renovation projects and acquisitions, which may adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We
have a revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $500 million that expires in 2018 via a bank group that is comprised of various large financial institutions with
the top four institutions providing approximately 42% of the facility. If a large percentage of our lenders were to file for bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations to us, we could
experience decreased levels of liquidity which could have a detrimental impact on our operations, including being able to fund our current project pipeline. There is no certainty that our lenders will
continue to remain solvent or fund their respective obligations under our senior secured credit facility.

Our indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us that could limit our operations and lead to
events of default if we do not comply with those covenants.

Our senior secured credit facility requires us, among other obligations, to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain
financial tests, including interest coverage, senior secured net leverage and total net leverage ratios. In addition, our credit facility restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional
indebtedness, incur guarantee obligations, repay certain other indebtedness or amend debt instruments, pay dividends, create liens on our assets, make investments, make acquisitions, engage in mergers
or consolidations, engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates or otherwise restrict corporate activities. In addition, the indenture governing the 5.875% senior unsecured notes
restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness (excluding certain indebtedness under our credit facility), issue certain preferred stock, pay dividends or distributions on
our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock, make certain investments, create liens on our assets to secure certain debt, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with
another company, transfer and sell assets and designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the documentation governing any of our
indebtedness, termination of the Master
Lease (subject to certain exceptions) or the occurrence of certain defaults under the Master Lease could lead to an event of default thereunder that could result in an acceleration of such
indebtedness. Such acceleration would likely constitute an event of default under our other indebtedness, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable
and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt.

To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many
factors beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available
to us under our senior secured credit facility in amounts sufficient



to
enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including with respect to our indebtedness. We also may incur indebtedness related to facilities we develop or acquire prior to generating cash flow from
those facilities. If those facilities do not provide us with cash flow to service that indebtedness, we will need to rely on cash flow from our other properties, which would increase our leverage. In
addition, if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements may increase significantly. As we are required to satisfy amortization requirements under our senior secured
credit facility or as other debt matures, we may also need to raise funds to refinance all or a portion of our debt. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including
our senior secured credit facility, on attractive terms, commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our debt will be
subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.

Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as variations in operating results, actions by
various regulatory agencies and legislatures, litigation, operating competition, market perceptions, progress with respect to potential acquisitions, changes in financial estimates and recommendations
by securities analysts, the actions of rating agencies, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and news reports relating to trends in
our markets or general economic conditions.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to various legal and administrative proceedings relating to personal injuries, employment matters, commercial
transactions and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations. In addition, the Company maintains what it believes is adequate insurance coverage to further mitigate the risks of such proceedings. However,
such proceedings can be costly, time consuming and unpredictable and, therefore, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of such proceedings may not materially impact the Company's
consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Further, no assurance can be given that the amount or scope of existing insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover losses arising from
such matters.

The
following proceedings could result in costs, settlements, damages, or rulings that materially impact the Company's consolidated financial condition or operating results. The Company
believes that it has meritorious defenses, claims and/or counter-claims with respect to these proceedings, and intends to vigorously defend itself or pursue its claims.

Gaming
licenses in Iowa are typically issued jointly to a gaming operator and a local charitable organization known as a QSO. The agreement between the Company's gaming operator
subsidiary in Iowa, Belle, and its QSO, MRHD, expired in early July 2012. On July 12, 2012, when presented with an extension of the Company's QSO/operating agreement for the Sioux City facility
through March 2015, the IRGC refused to approve the extension. On April 18, 2013, the IRGC awarded the license to another gaming operator. In August 2013, the IRGC formally denied the Company's
application for a renewal of its state license. The Belle filed numerous petitions challenging the IRGC's actions which have all been denied by the Iowa District Court in Polk County, Iowa. The Belle
has filed a consolidated appeal which is pending before the Iowa Supreme Court. On July 30, 2014, Argosy Casino Sioux City ceased its operations.

On
October 21, 2011, the Ohio Roundtable filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas in Franklin County, Ohio against a number of defendants, including the Governor, the Ohio
Lottery Commission and the Ohio Casino Control Commission. The complaint alleges a variety of substantive and procedural defects relative to the approval and implementation of video lottery terminals
as well as several counts dealing with the taxation of standalone casinos. As intervenors, we, along with the other two casinos in Ohio, filed motions for judgment on the pleadings to supplement the
position of the Racing Commission. In May 2012, the complaint was dismissed, and in March 2013, the Ohio appeals court upheld the dismissal. On April 30, 2013, plaintiffs requested the Ohio
Supreme Court to hear an appeal of the decision, and the Ohio Supreme Court elected to accept the appeal. The appeal is currently pending.

506 holders of record of our common stock.

Dividend Policy

Since our initial public offering of common stock in May 1994, we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to
retain all of our earnings to finance the development of our business, and thus, do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Payment of any cash dividends
in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, operations and capital requirements, our general financial condition
and general business conditions. In addition, our senior secured credit facility and senior notes restrict, among other things, our ability to pay dividends. In addition, future financing arrangements
may prohibit the payment of dividends under certain conditions.

Stock Repurchase

We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter of 2014.

On
October 11, 2013, the Company completed its previously disclosed exchange and repurchase transactions with FIF V PFD LLC ("Fortress"), which is an affiliate of Fortress
Investment Group LLC, and certain affiliates of Centerbridge Capital Partners, L.P. (collectively, "Centerbridge"). In the transactions, on October 11, 2013, Penn
(i) issued 14,553 shares of its Series C preferred stock to Fortress in exchange for all of the 9,750 shares of Penn's Series B preferred stock held by Fortress,
(ii) repurchased 5,929 of its Series C preferred stock from Fortress for cash consideration of $397.2 million and (iii) repurchased all of the 2,300 shares of Penn's
Series B preferred stock held by Centerbridge for cash consideration of $230.0 million. As a result of this transaction, there are no longer any shares of Penn's Series B
preferred stock outstanding.



Subject
to the terms and conditions of the Statement with Respect to Shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, the 8,624 remaining shares of Series C preferred stock
held by Fortress are convertible into 8,624,000 shares of Penn common stock.

(1)

During
the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded pre-tax goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of $316.5 million
($253.5 million, net of taxes), as we determined that a portion of the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired due to our outlook of continued challenging regional gaming
conditions which persisted in 2014 at certain properties in our Southern Plains segment,



as
well as for the write-off of a trademark intangible asset in the West segment. During the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $4.6 million
($2.8 million, net of taxes) to write-down certain idle assets to their estimated salvage value. Rental expense under the Master Lease, which became effective November 1, 2013, was
$421.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

(2)

Primarily
as of result of the Spin-Off, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $1,058.4 million ($842.9 million, net of taxes) during the
year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, as a result of a new gaming license being awarded for the development of an additional casino in Sioux City, Iowa to another applicant in April 2013,
we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $71.8 million ($70.5 million, net of taxes) for Argosy Casino Sioux City during the year ended December 31, 2013. Additionally, in
conjunction with the relocation of our two racetracks in Ohio, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $2.2 million ($1.4 million, net of taxes) during the year ended
December 31, 2013. Furthermore, for 2013, we incurred a $61.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt, transaction costs associated with the Spin-Off of $28.8 million,
and rental expense under the Master Lease of $69.5 million.

(3)

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred non-deductible lobbying costs of $45.1 million associated with our unsuccessful efforts
to oppose an expansion of gaming in the state of Maryland and transaction costs associated with the Spin-Off of $7.1 million.

(4)

As
a result of decreased earnings projections resulting from an anticipated increase in competition from the scheduled opening of a $445 million
casino in the second half of 2011 in Des Plaines, Illinois, as well as continued challenging market conditions in the Chicagoland regional market, we recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of
$188.8 million ($173.0 million, net of taxes) related to our Aurora and Joliet properties during the year ended December 31, 2010. As a result of the May 2010 statewide election,
whereby the voters determined that our casino in Columbus could be located at the site of the former Delphi Automotive plant along Columbus's West Side, we reclassified the land that we had previously
purchased in the Arena District site that had been originally approved for our casino as held for sale and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $31.3 million ($20.1 million, net of
taxes). Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we wrote-off the trademark intangible asset associated with the Argosy acquisition for $4.4 million ($2.8 million,
net of taxes) due to management's strategy to transition Argosy properties to the Hollywood Casino brand.

(5)

Since
we reported a loss from operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2010, we were required to use basic weighted-average common
shares outstanding, rather than diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding, when calculating diluted loss per share for those periods.



ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our Operations

We are a leading, diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and pari-mutuel properties. In 1997, we began our
transition from a pari-mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the Charles Town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in West Virginia. Since 1997, we
have continued to expand our gaming operations through strategic acquisitions, greenfield projects, and property expansions. We, along with our joint venture partner, opened Hollywood Casino at Kansas
Speedway on February 3, 2012. In Ohio, we opened four new gaming properties over the last three years, including: Hollywood Casino Toledo on May 29, 2012, Hollywood Casino Columbus on
October 8, 2012, Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway on August 28, 2014, and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course on September 17, 2014. In addition, on
November 2, 2012, we acquired Harrah's St. Louis, which we subsequently rebranded as Hollywood Casino St. Louis. Finally, we are in the process of constructing Plainridge Park
Casino, an integrated racing and gaming facility in Plainville, Massachusetts, which we expect to open in June 2015, as well as the Jamul development project near San Diego, California, which we
anticipate completing in mid-2016. We believe that our portfolio of assets provides us the benefit of geographically diversified cash flow from operations.

As
of December 31, 2014, we owned, managed, or had ownership interests in twenty-six facilities in the following seventeen jurisdictions: Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Ontario. On July 30, 2014, the Company closed its facility
in Sioux City, Iowa. In addition, Beulah Park and Raceway Park in Ohio were closed as the racetracks were relocated to Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course and Hollywood Gaming at Dayton
Raceway, respectively, both of which opened in the third quarter of 2014.

The
vast majority of our revenue is gaming revenue, derived primarily from gaming on slot machines (which represented approximately 84% and 83% of our gaming revenue in 2014 and 2013,
respectively) and to a lesser extent, table games, which is highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties. Other revenues are derived from our management service
fee from Casino Rama, our transition service fees from GLPI, our hotel, dining, retail, admissions, program sales, concessions and certain other ancillary activities, and our racing operations. Our
racing revenue includes our share of pari-mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers, our share of wagering from import and export simulcasting, and our share of
wagering from our OTWs.

Key
performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot handle and table game drop (volume indicators) and "win" or "hold" percentage. Our typical property slot hold percentage is
in the range of 6% to 10% of slot handle, and our typical table game win percentage is in the range of 12% to 25% of table game drop.

Slot
handle is the gross amount wagered for the period cited. The win or hold percentage is the net amount of gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for accruals related to
the anticipated payout of progressive jackpots. Our slot hold percentages have consistently been in the 6% to 10% range over the past several years. Given the stability in our slot hold percentages,
we have not experienced significant impacts to earnings from changes in these percentages.

For
table games, customers usually purchase cash chips at the gaming tables. The cash and markers (extensions of credit granted to certain credit worthy customers) are deposited in the
gaming table's drop box. Table game win is the amount of drop that is retained and recorded as casino gaming revenue, with liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play
occurs and for



unredeemed
gaming chips. As we are focused on regional gaming markets, our table win percentages are fairly stable as the majority of these markets do not regularly experience high-end play, which can
lead to volatility in win percentages. Therefore, changes in table game win percentages do not typically have a material impact to our earnings.

Our
properties generate significant operating cash flow, since most of our revenue is cash-based from slot machines, table games, and pari-mutuel wagering. Our business is capital
intensive, and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to pay rent to GLPI under the Master Lease, repay debt, fund capital maintenance expenditures, fund new capital
projects at existing properties and provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions.

We
continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties, the pursuit of strategic
acquisitions and the development of new gaming properties, particularly in attractive regional markets. Additional information regarding our capital projects is discussed in detail in the section
entitled "Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditures" below.

Spin-Off of Real Estate Assets through a Real Estate Investment Trust

On November 1, 2013, the Company completed its plan to separate its gaming operating assets from its real property assets by
creating a newly formed, publicly traded REIT, known as GLPI, through a tax free Spin-Off. Penn effected the Spin-Off by distributing one share of common stock of GLPI to the holders of Penn common
stock and Series C Preferred Stock for every share of Penn common stock and every 1/1000th of a share of Series C Preferred Stock that they held at the close of business on
October 16, 2013, the record date for the Spin-Off. Peter M. Carlino and the PMC Delaware Dynasty Trust dated September 25, 2013, a trust for the benefit of Mr. Carlino's
children, also received additional shares of GLPI common stock, in exchange for shares of Penn common stock that they transferred to Penn immediately prior to the Spin-Off, and Mr. Carlino
exchanged certain options to acquire Penn common stock for options to acquire GLPI common stock having the same aggregate intrinsic value. Penn engaged in these exchanges with Mr. Carlino and
his related trust to ensure that each member of the Carlino family beneficially owns 9.9% or less of the outstanding shares of Penn common stock following the Spin-Off, so that GLPI can qualify to be
taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

In
addition, through a series of internal corporate restructurings, Penn contributed to GLPI substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with Penn's real property
interests and real estate development business, as well as all of the assets and liabilities of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville, which are referred to as the "TRS
Properties." As a result of the Spin-Off, GLPI owns substantially all of Penn's former real property assets and leases back those assets (other than the TRS Properties) to Penn for use by its
subsidiaries, under the Master Lease (which has a fifteen-year initial term that can be extended at Penn's option for up to four five-year renewal terms), as well as owns and operates the TRS
Properties. Penn continues to operate the leased gaming facilities and hold the associated gaming licenses with these facilities. As a result of the Spin-Off, the Company's results for the year ended
December 31, 2013 only include the TRS Properties for the period January 1, 2013 through October 31, 2013.

On
November 1, 2013, Penn entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with GLPI, which governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of the two companies after the
Spin-Off with respect to payment of tax liabilities, entitlement of refunds, and filing of tax returns and sets forth certain covenants and indemnities. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, Penn was
required to prepare and file a federal consolidated income tax return for 2013, which included a combination of Penn and GLPI legal entities for the activity prior to the Spin-Off, with any
adjustments for the impact of the final consolidated income tax return recorded to either shareholders' equity or the statement of income



depending
on the specific item giving rise to the adjustment. In conjunction with the filing of the final 2013 federal consolidated income tax return with the Internal Revenue Service, Penn recorded
an increase to shareholders' equity of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.

The
Company received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service relating to the tax treatment of the separation and the qualification of GLPI as a REIT. The private letter
ruling is subject to certain qualifications and based on certain representations and statements made by the Company and certain of its shareholders. If such representations and statements are untrue
or incomplete in any material respect (including as a result of a material change in the transaction or other relevant facts), the Company may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling. The
Company received opinions from outside counsel regarding certain aspects of the transaction that are not covered by the private letter ruling.

The
Company incurred transaction costs of $0.9 million, $28.8 million, and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively,
associated with the Spin-Off, which were included in general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statements of operations.

Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's CODM as that term is defined in ASC 280, measures and assesses the Company's business
performance based on regional operations of various properties grouped together based primarily on their geographic locations. In January 2014, the Company named Jay Snowden as its Chief Operating
Officer and the Company decided in connection with this announcement to re-align its reporting structure. Starting in January 2014, the Company's reportable segments are: (i) East/Midwest,
(ii) West, and (iii) Southern Plains. The prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to the Company's new reporting structure in accordance with ASC 280.

The
East/Midwest reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, Hollywood Casino Bangor, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course,
Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, Hollywood Casino Toledo, which opened on May 29, 2012, Hollywood Casino Columbus, which opened on October 8, 2012, Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway,
which opened on August 28, 2014, and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course, which opened on
September 17, 2014. It also includes the Company's Casino Rama management service contract and the Plainville project in Massachusetts which the Company expects to open in June 2015. It also
previously included Hollywood Casino Perryville, which was contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

The
West reportable segment consists of the following properties: Zia Park Casino and the M Resort, as well as the Jamul development project, which the Company anticipates
completing in mid-2016.

The
Southern Plains reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino Aurora, Hollywood Casino Joliet, Argosy Casino Alton, Argosy Casino Riverside, Hollywood
Casino Tunica, Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast (formerly Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis), Boomtown Biloxi, and Hollywood Casino St. Louis (formerly Harrah's St. Louis which was
acquired from Caesars Entertainment on November 2, 2012), and includes the Company's 50% investment in Kansas Entertainment, which owns the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway. On
July 30, 2014, the Company closed Argosy Casino Sioux City. This segment also previously included Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge, which was contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

The
Other category consists of the Company's standalone racing operations, namely Rosecroft Raceway, Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club, and the Company's joint venture interests in Sam Houston
Race Park, Valley Race Park, and Freehold Raceway, as well as the Company's 50% joint venture with the Cordish Companies in New York which we anticipate dissolving in 2015. It also previously included



the
Company's Bullwhackers property, which was sold in July 2013. If the Company is successful in obtaining gaming operations at these locations, they would be assigned to one of the Company's
reportable segments. The Other category also includes the Company's corporate overhead operations which does not meet the definition of an operating segment under ASC 280.

Executive Summary

Continued sluggish economic conditions and the expansion of newly constructed gaming facilities continue to impact the overall domestic
gaming industry as well as our operating results. We believe that current economic conditions, including, but not limited to, a weak economic recovery, low levels of consumer confidence, and higher
taxes paid by individuals, have resulted in reduced levels of discretionary consumer spending compared to historical levels.
Additionally, the expansion of newly constructed gaming facilities has substantially increased competition in many of our regional markets (including some of our larger facilities).

We
operate a geographically diversified portfolio comprised largely of new and well maintained regional gaming facilities. This has allowed us to develop what we believe to be a solid
base for future growth opportunities. We have also made investments in joint ventures that we believe may allow us to capitalize on additional gaming opportunities in certain states if legislation or
referenda are passed that permit and/or expand gaming in these jurisdictions and we are selected as a licensee. Historically, the Company has been reliant on certain key regional gaming markets (for
example, its results from Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg). Over the past several years, the Company has diversified its operations via new development
facilities and acquisitions and anticipates further diversifying its reliance on specific properties in connection with its current development pipeline.

Financial Highlights:

We reported net revenues and a loss from operations of $2,590.5 million and $240.4 million, respectively, for the year
ended December 31, 2014, compared to net revenues and a loss from operations of $2,918.8 million and $772.0 million, respectively, for the corresponding period in the prior year.

$13.9 million primarily due to the favorable impact from declines in GLPI's stock price for GLPI awards held by Penn employees and the fact that certain members of Penn's executive management
team transferred their employment to GLPI as part of the Spin-Off, lower stock-based compensation costs of $12.1 million primarily due to lower aggregate executive compensation following the
Spin-Off, and a reduction in various other items due to cost containment measures, all of which was partially offset by higher lobbying costs of $3.5 million.

Segment Developments:

The following are recent developments that have had or will have an impact on us by segments:

East/Midwest

•

In June 2012, we announced that we had filed applications with the Ohio Lottery Commission for Video Lottery Sales Agent Licenses for
our Ohio racetracks, Raceway Park and Beulah Park, and with the Ohio State Racing Commission for permission to relocate the racetracks to Dayton and Austintown, respectively. On May 1, 2013, we
received approval from the Ohio Racing Commission for our relocation plans. Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course, which opened on September 17, 2014, features a one-mile thoroughbred
track and 866 video lottery terminals. Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway, which opened on August 28, 2014,



features
a


/


-mile standardbred track and 984 video lottery terminals. See the section entitled "Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditures" below for further
details.

•

On October 21, 2011, the Ohio Roundtable filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas in Franklin County, Ohio against a
number of defendants, including the Governor, the Ohio Lottery Commission and the Ohio Casino Control Commission. The complaint alleges a variety of substantive and procedural defects relative to the
approval and implementation of video lottery terminals as well as several counts dealing with the taxation of standalone casinos. As intervenors, we, along with the other two casinos in Ohio, filed
motions for judgment on the pleadings to supplement the position of the Racing Commission. In May 2012, the complaint was dismissed, and in March 2013, the Ohio appeals court upheld the dismissal. On
April 30, 2013, plaintiffs requested the Ohio Supreme Court to hear an appeal of the decision, and the Ohio Supreme Court elected to accept the appeal. The appeal is currently pending.

•

In addition, the Ohio Racing Commission's decision to permit Raceway Park to relocate its Toledo racetrack to Dayton was challenged in
the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas by Lebanon Trotting Club, Inc., the prior owner of a neighboring racetrack. The Ohio Racing Commission and Raceway Park filed briefs requesting the
Franklin County Court to uphold the Ohio Racing Commission's decision. In July 2014, the lawsuit was dismissed by the court, and Lebanon Trotting Club, Inc. did not appeal, making this decision
final.

•

Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg faced increased competition, and their results have been and will continue to be negatively impacted by
the openings of Horseshoe Casino in Cincinnati, Ohio in March 2013, as well as to a lesser extent, a racino at Miami Valley Gaming in mid-December 2013, a racino at Belterra Park in May 2014, and our
own Dayton facility in August 2014.

•

Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races faced increased competition and their results have been negatively impacted by the opening of a
casino complex at the Arundel Mills mall in Anne Arundel, Maryland. The casino opened on June 6, 2012 with approximately 3,200 slot machines and significantly increased its slot machine
offerings by mid-September 2012 to approximately 4,750 slot machines. In addition, the Anne Arundel facility opened table games on April 11, 2013 and opened a 52 table poker room in late August
2013.

•

On February 28, 2014, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission awarded the Company a Category Two slots-only gaming license for its
planned $225 million (including licensing fees) Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville, Massachusetts. On March 14, 2014, the Company broke ground on the facility, which will feature live
harness racing and simulcasting, along with 1,250 gaming devices, various dining and entertainment options, structured and surface parking, and a two story clubhouse with approximately 55,000
square feet. The Company expects the facility to open in June 2015. In June 2014, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled to permit a referendum to repeal the enabling legislation in
Massachusetts to be included in the November 4, 2014 general election ballot, but this referendum was defeated and the enabling legislation was therefore confirmed.

•

Through CHC Casinos, we manage Casino Rama, a full service gaming and entertainment facility, on behalf of the OLGC. The Casino Rama
Agreement sets out the duties, rights and obligations of CHC Casinos and our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, CRC Holdings, Inc. In June 2014, we signed an agreement to extend the Casino
Rama Agreement on a month-to-month basis with a 60-day notice period for up to a maximum period of forty-eight months.



West

•

On April 5, 2013, we announced that, subject to final National Indian Gaming Commission approval, we and the Jamul Tribe had
entered into definitive agreements (including management, development, branding and lending arrangements), to jointly develop a Hollywood Casino-branded casino on the Jamul Tribe's trust land in San
Diego County, California. The proposed facility is located approximately 20 miles east of downtown San Diego. The proposed $360 million development project will include a three-story gaming and
entertainment facility of approximately 200,000 square feet featuring over 1,700 slot machines, 43 live table games, including poker, multiple restaurants, bars and lounges and a partially enclosed
parking structure with over 1,800 spaces. In mid-January 2014, we announced the commencement of construction activities at the site and it is anticipated that the facility will open in mid-2016. We
currently provide financing to the Jamul Tribe in connection with the project and, upon opening, we will manage and provide branding for the casino.

Southern Plains

•

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, on July 30, 2014, Argosy Casino Sioux City ceased its
operations.

Critical Accounting Estimates

We make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements. The nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the
susceptibility of such factors to change. We have identified the accounting for long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes and litigation, claims and assessments as critical
accounting estimates, as they are the most important to our financial statement presentation and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments.

We
believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience
differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial
statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial condition.

The
development and selection of the critical accounting estimates, and the related disclosures, have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Long-lived assets

At December 31, 2014, we had a net property and equipment balance of $769.1 million within our consolidated balance
sheet, representing 34.4% of total assets. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are determined based on the
nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy. We review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by us in
performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. For purposes of recognizing
and measuring impairment in accordance with ASC 360, "Property, Plant, and Equipment," assets are grouped at the individual property level representing the lowest level for which identifiable cash
flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. In assessing the



recoverability
of the carrying value of property and equipment, we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or the related assumptions change in the
future, we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. Such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non-cash component of operating income.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

At December 31, 2014, the Company had $277.6 million in goodwill and $370.6 million in other intangible assets
within its consolidated balance sheet, representing 12.4% and 16.6% of total assets, respectively, resulting from the Company's acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses. Two
issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment: (i) the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation; and
(ii) the ongoing evaluation for impairment.

In
connection with our acquisitions, valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices. The factors considered in the valuations include data gathered as a
result of our due diligence in connection with the acquisitions, projections for future operations, and data obtained from third- party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate. Goodwill represents
the future economic benefits of a business combination measured as the excess purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually, or more frequently if
indicators of impairment exist, in two steps. In step 1 of the impairment test, the current fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model which is then compared to
the carrying value of each reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value in step 1 of the impairment test, then step 2 of the impairment test is performed to
determine the implied fair value of goodwill for that reporting unit. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the goodwill allocated for that reporting unit, an impairment is recognized.

In
accordance with ASC 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other," the Company considers its gaming licenses and other various intangible assets as indefinite-life intangible assets that do
not require amortization based on our future expectations to operate our gaming facilities indefinitely (notwithstanding the recent events in Iowa, which we concluded was an isolated incident and the
first time in our history a gaming regulator has taken an action which could cause us to lose our gaming license) as well as our historical experience in renewing these intangible assets at minimal
cost with various state commissions. Rather, these intangible assets are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, by comparing the fair value of the
recorded assets to their carrying amount. If the carrying amounts of the indefinite-life intangible assets exceed their fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The Company completes its testing
of its intangible assets prior to assessing the realizability of its goodwill.

The
Company assessed the fair value of its indefinite-life intangible assets (which are primarily gaming licenses) using the Greenfield Method under the income approach. The Greenfield
Method estimates the fair value of the license using a discounted cash flow model assuming the Company built a casino with similar utility to that of the existing facility. The method assumes a
theoretical start-up company going into business without any assets other than the intangible asset being valued. As such, the value of the license is a function of the following
items:

•

Projected revenues and operating cash flows (including an allocation of the Company's projected rental obligation to its reporting
units);

•

Theoretical construction costs and duration;

•

Pre-opening expenses;

•

Discounting that reflects the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows attributable to the license; and



•

Remaining useful life of the license.

The
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine the estimated fair value
of the reporting unit and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. We must make various assumptions and estimates in performing our impairment testing. The implied fair value includes estimates of
future cash flows (including an allocation of the Company's projected rental obligation to its reporting units) that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent our best
estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets including their eventual disposition. Changes in estimates, increases in our cost of capital, reductions in transaction
multiples, changes in operating and capital expenditure assumptions or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results. Future cash flow estimates
are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. If our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not
met, we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods. Our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating
information and budgets of the various properties where we conduct operations. These estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state or local regulations, economic downturns, or
other events affecting our properties.

Forecasted
cash flows (based on our annual operating plan as determined in the fourth quarter) can be significantly impacted by the local economy in which our reporting units operate.
For example, increases in unemployment rates can result in decreased customer visitations and/or lower customer spend per visit. In addition, the impact of new legislation which approves gaming in
nearby jurisdictions or further expands gaming in jurisdictions where our reporting units currently operate can result in opportunities for us to expand our operations. However, it also has the impact
of increasing competition for our established properties which generally will have a negative effect on those locations' profitability once competitors become established as a certain level of
cannibalization occurs absent an overall increase in customer visitations. Lastly, increases in gaming taxes approved by state regulatory bodies can negatively impact forecasted cash flows.

Assumptions
and estimates about future cash flow levels and multiples by individual reporting units are complex and subjective. They are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions
and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as industry, geopolitical and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in our business strategy, which may
reallocate capital and resources to different or new opportunities which management believes will enhance our overall value but may be to the detriment of an individual reporting unit.

Consistent
with prior years, the Company's annual goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets impairment test is performed on October 1

st

of each
year.

For
the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded pre-tax goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of $316.5 million ($253.5 million, net of
taxes), as it determined that a portion of the value of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired as a result of the October 1, 2014 impairment test due to the Company's outlook of
continued challenging regional gaming conditions at certain properties which persisted in 2014 in its Southern Plains segment, as well as for the write-off of a trademark intangible asset in the West
segment. The impairment charges by segment were as follows: Southern Plains, $315.1 million pre-tax ($252.7 million, net of taxes) and West, $1.4 million pre-tax
($0.8 million, net of taxes).

For
2013, as the Spin-Off was a significant financial event, an interim goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets impairment test as of November 1, 2013, the Spin-Off
date, was performed. For the November 1, 2013 impairment test, the forecasted cash flows for each applicable property was updated to include the rent expense to be paid to GLPI under the Master
Lease. As of a result of the impairment test, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $1,058.4 million



($842.9 million,
net of taxes) for the year ended December 31, 2013, as we determined that a portion of the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired. The impairment
charge by segment was as follows: East/Midwest, $429.6 million pre-tax ($348.8 million, net of taxes); Southern Plains, $592.6 million pre-tax ($465.6 million, net of
taxes); and Other, $36.2 million pre-tax ($28.5 million, net of taxes).

Additionally,
as a result of a new gaming license being awarded for the development of a new casino in Sioux City, Iowa to another applicant in April 2013, we recorded a pre-tax
impairment charge of $71.8 million ($70.5 million, net of taxes) for Argosy Casino Sioux City during the three months ended June 30, 2013, as we determined that the fair value of
our Sioux City reporting unit was less than its carrying amount based on the Company's analysis of the estimated future expected cash flows the Company anticipated receiving from the operations of
this facility.

Consistent
with prior years, we believe at this time all of our reporting units with goodwill and other intangible assets are at risk to have impairment charges in future periods
regardless of the margin by which the current fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying value and that such margin cannot and should not be relied upon to predict which properties are
most at risk for future impairment charges. This is because the revenue and earning streams in our industry can vary significantly based on various circumstances, which in many cases are outside of
the Company's control, and as such are extremely difficult to predict and quantify. We have disclosed several of these circumstances in the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. For instance, changes in legislation that approves gaming in nearby jurisdictions, further expansion of gaming in jurisdictions where we currently operate, new state legislation that
requires the implementation of smoking bans at our casinos or any other events outside of our control that make the customer experience less desirable.

Once
an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite-life intangible assets has been recorded, it cannot be reversed. Because our goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets are not
amortized, there may be volatility in reported income because impairment losses, if any, are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts. Intangible assets that have a definite- life are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or related service contract. We review the carrying value of our intangible assets that have a definite-life for possible
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the intangible assets that have a definite-life exceed their
fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.

Income taxes

At December 31, 2014, we had a net deferred tax asset balance of $134.6 million within our consolidated balance sheet. We
account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes" ("ASC 740"). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or
realized. ASC 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
realizability of the net deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance, if necessary. We consider all
available positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. The
evaluation of both positive and negative evidence is a requirement pursuant to ASC 740 in determining more-likely-than-not the net deferred tax assets will be realized. In the event the Company
determines that the deferred income tax
assets would be realized in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.

ASC
740 also creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions, and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial
statements by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. It also provides guidance on
derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. At December 31, 2014, we had a liability for unrecognized tax
benefits of $8.2 million, which is included in noncurrent tax liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet. We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audits in
each jurisdiction. These audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve. In our opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all open
periods.

Litigation, claims and assessments

We utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. These estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding
current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. If our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimate, which may have an adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Results of Operations

The following are the most important factors and trends that contribute to our operating
performance:

•

The fact that most of our properties operate in mature competitive markets. As a result, we expect a majority of our future growth to
come from prudent acquisitions of gaming properties (such as our November 2012 acquisition of Harrah's St. Louis gaming and lodging facility from Caesars Entertainment), jurisdictional
expansions (such as our planned June 2015 opening of a slots-only gaming facility in Massachusetts, the September 2014 opening of Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course, the August 2014
opening of Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway, the October 2012 opening of Hollywood Casino Columbus, and the May 2012 opening of Hollywood Casino Toledo), expansions of gaming in existing
jurisdictions (such as the introduction of table games in July 2010 at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, and at Hollywood Casino Bangor in March



2012)
and expansions/improvements of existing properties (such as a hotel at Zia Park which opened on August 28, 2014).

•

The fact that a number of states (such as New York and Massachusetts) are currently considering or implementing legislation to
legalize or expand gaming. Such legislation presents both potential opportunities to establish new properties (for example, in Massachusetts, where we were awarded the slots-only gaming license on
February 28, 2014, in Kansas, where we opened a casino through a joint venture in February 2012, and in Ohio, where we opened casinos in Toledo and Columbus in May 2012 and October 2012,
respectively, and opened video lottery terminal facilities at two racetracks in the third quarter of 2014) and increased competitive threats to business at our existing properties (such as the
introduction/expansion of commercial casinos in Kansas, Maryland, Ohio, and potentially Kentucky, Nebraska and Illinois, and the introduction of tavern licenses in several states, most significantly
in Illinois).

•

The actions of government bodies can affect our operations in a variety of ways. For instance, the continued pressure on governments
to balance their budgets could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes, or via an expansion of gaming. In
addition, government bodies may restrict, prevent or negatively impact operations in the jurisdictions in which we do business (such as the implementation of smoking bans).

•

The continued demand for, and our emphasis on, slot wagering entertainment at our properties.

•

The successful execution of our development and construction activities, as well as the risks associated with the costs, regulatory
approval and the timing of these activities.

•

The risks related to economic conditions and the effect of such prolonged sluggish conditions on consumer spending for leisure and
gaming activities, which may negatively impact our operating results and our ability to continue to access financing at favorable terms.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR

Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR are used by management as the primary measure of the Company's operating performance. We define
adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, stock compensation, debt extinguishment charges, impairment charges, insurance recoveries and deductible charges, depreciation and amortization,
gain or loss on disposal of assets, and other income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is also inclusive of income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates, with our share of non-operating items (such as
depreciation and amortization) added back for our joint venture in Kansas Entertainment. Adjusted EBITDAR is adjusted EBITDA excluding rent expense associated with our Master Lease agreement with
GLPI. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR have economic substance because they are used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our business, and are especially relevant
in evaluating large, long-lived casino projects because they provide a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial non-operational depreciation charges and
financing costs of such projects. We also present adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR because they are used by
some investors and creditors as an indicator of the strength and performance of ongoing business operations, including our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and
operations. These calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within our industry. In
addition, gaming companies have historically reported adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more
stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their adjusted EBITDA calculations certain corporate expenses that do not relate to the management of specific casino
properties. However, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR are not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR information is
presented as a supplemental disclosure, as management believes that it is a widely used measure of performance in the gaming industry, is the principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies, and
that it is considered by many to be a better indicator of the Company's operating results than net income (loss) per GAAP. Management uses adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR as the primary measures
of the operating performance of its segments, including the evaluation of operating personnel. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR should not be construed as alternatives to operating income, as
indicators of the Company's operating performance, as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, as measures of liquidity, or as any other measures of performance determined in accordance
with GAAP. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA and
adjusted EBITDAR. It should also be noted that other gaming companies that report adjusted EBITDA information may calculate adjusted EBITDA in a different manner than the Company and therefore,
comparability may be limited.



A
reconciliation of the Company's net income (loss) per GAAP to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR, as well as the Company's income (loss) from operations per GAAP to adjusted EBITDA
and adjusted EBITDAR, is included below. Additionally, a reconciliation of each segment's income (loss) from operations to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR is also included below. On a segment
level, income (loss) from operations per GAAP, rather than net income (loss) per GAAP, is reconciled to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR due to, among other things, the impracticability of
allocating interest expense, interest income, income taxes and certain other items to the Company's segments on a segment by segment basis. Management believes that this presentation is more
meaningful to investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's segments and is consistent with the reporting of other gaming companies.

The
reconciliation of the Company's (loss) income from operations per GAAP to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR, as well as the Company's net (loss) income per GAAP to adjusted EBITDA
and adjusted EBITDAR, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was as follows:

2014 Compared to 2013

Adjusted EBITDAR for our East/Midwest segment decreased by $85.5 million, or 16.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2014,
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to competition discussed below, which impacted Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, weakened
regional economic conditions for Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, and a $15.3 million decline in adjusted EBITDAR due to the contribution of Hollywood Casino Perryville to GLPI on
November 1, 2013, all of which was partially offset by the openings of Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course on September 17, 2014 and Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway on
August 28, 2014. Additionally, results for the year ended December 31, 2014



included
pre-opening costs of $10.2 million for both Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course, as well as the Plainville project in Massachusetts,
which the Company expects to open in June 2015.

Adjusted
EBITDAR for our Southern Plains segment decreased by $30.0 million, or 9.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2013, primarily from a $20.0 million decline in adjusted EBITDAR due to the contribution of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge to GLPI on November 1, 2013, and decreased
adjusted EBITDAR for Argosy Casino Sioux City primarily due to its closure on July 30, 2014.

Adjusted
EBITDAR for our West segment increased by $4.4 million, or 7.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013,
primarily due to a termination charge associated with the Spin-Off of $3.8 million incurred in the third quarter of 2013.

Adjusted
EBITDAR for Other improved by $41.4 million, or 36.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due
to lower Spin-Off transaction and development costs of $30.0 million, lower costs on cash-settled stock based awards of $13.9 million primarily due to the favorable impact from declines
in GLPI's stock price for GLPI awards held by Penn employees and the fact that certain members of Penn's executive management team transferred their employment to GLPI as part of the Spin-Off, higher
transition service fees received from GLPI of $1.2 million, and a reduction in various other items due to cost containment measures, all of which was partially offset by higher lobbying costs
of $3.5 million.

2013 Compared with 2012

Adjusted EBITDAR for our East/Midwest segment increased by $4.6 million, or 0.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2013,
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to the openings of Hollywood Casino Toledo on May 29, 2012 and Hollywood Casino Columbus on October 8, 2012. These
increases were partially offset by a decline in results at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg and Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races due to new competition discussed further below, as well as Hollywood
Casino Perryville's results being negatively impacted by increased competition discussed further below and being contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013. Additionally, results for the year
ended December 31, 2012 included pre-opening costs of $20.2 million for both Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo.

Adjusted
EBITDAR for our Southern Plains segment increased by $17.0 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2012, primarily due to the acquisition of Harrah's St. Louis on November 2, 2012. This increase was partially offset by reduced earnings at Hollywood Casino Joliet
and Hollywood Casino Aurora primarily due to regional economic factors, and at Argosy Casino Sioux City primarily due to a challenging local gaming market and a negative impact related to the
then-potential loss of our gaming license. Additionally, Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge's results were negatively impacted by increased competition discussed further below and the property being
contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

Adjusted
EBITDA for Other improved by $31.5 million, or 21.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due
to lobbying costs of $45.1 million related to our efforts in Maryland and a $6.4 million legal accrual for our Cherokee County, Kansas litigation in 2012, partially offset by higher
legal, consulting and other fees of $24.3 million related to the pursuit of potential opportunities, including the Spin-Off transaction, for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared
to the corresponding period in the prior year.

In
our business, revenue is driven by discretionary consumer spending, which has been impacted by a slow economic recovery that has resulted in declines in the labor force participation
rate, higher taxes, and increased stock market and commodity price volatility. The expansion of newly constructed gaming facilities has also increased competition in many regional markets (including
at some of our key facilities).

We
have no certain mechanism for determining why consumers choose to spend more or less money at our properties from period to period and as such cannot quantify a dollar amount for each
factor that impacts our customers' spending behaviors. However, based on our experience, we can generally offer some insight into the factors that we believe were likely to account for such changes.
In instances where we believe one factor may have had a significantly greater impact than the other factors, we have noted that as well. However, in all instances, such insights are based only on our
reasonable judgment and professional experience, and no assurance can be given as to the accuracy of our judgments.

Gaming revenue

2014 Compared with 2013

Gaming revenue decreased by $318.0 million, or 12.2%, to $2,297.2 million in 2014, primarily due to the variances
explained below.

Gaming
revenue for our East/Midwest segment decreased by $177.8 million in 2014, primarily due to decreased gaming revenue at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races of
$64.0 million primarily due to the continued impact of the opening of a casino complex at the Arundel Mills mall in Maryland in 2012, which added table games in April 2013 and a 52 table poker
room in late August 2013, decreased gaming revenue at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg of $71.9 million primarily due to new competition,
namely a new casino that opened in March 2013 in Cincinnati, Ohio and to a lesser extent the openings of a racino at Miami Valley Gaming in mid-December 2013, a racino at Belterra Park in May 2014,
and our own Dayton facility in late August 2014, the contribution of Hollywood Casino



Perryville
to GLPI on November 1, 2013, which had $74.5 million of gaming revenue for the ten months ended October 31, 2013, and decreased gaming revenue at Hollywood Casino at
Penn National Race Course of $19.6 million primarily due to regional economic conditions. These decreases were partially offset by the openings of Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race
Course on September 17, 2014 and Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway on August 28, 2014, which generated $28.6 million and $27.3 million, respectively, of gaming revenue for
the year December 31, 2014.

Gaming
revenue for our Southern Plains segment decreased by $135.6 million in 2014, primarily due to the contribution of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge to GLPI on November 1,
2013, which had $61.1 million of gaming revenue for the ten months ended October 31, 2013, decreased gaming revenue at Argosy Casino Sioux City of $23.4 million primarily due to
its closure on July 30, 2014, and general softness in the regional markets in which our Southern Plains properties compete, as well as additional competition from video lottery terminals in
Illinois.

2013 Compared with 2012

Gaming revenue increased by $24.6 million, or 1.0%, to $2,615.2 million in 2013, primarily due to the variances explained
below.

Gaming
revenue for our Southern Plains segment increased by $71.4 million in 2013, primarily due to the acquisition of Harrah's St. Louis facility on November 2,
2012, which had increased gaming revenue of $169.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, which was partially offset by
decreased gaming revenue at Hollywood Casino Joliet and Hollywood Casino Aurora primarily due to regional economic factors, at Argosy Casino Riverside primarily due to the continued impact of the
opening of our Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway joint venture in February 2012, and at Argosy Casino Sioux City primarily due to a challenging local gaming market and a negative impact related to
the then-potential loss of our gaming license. In addition, Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge experienced decreased gaming revenue of $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as
compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to the opening of a new riverboat casino and hotel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on September 1, 2012, as well as the property
being contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

revenue for our East/Midwest segment decreased by $42.3 million in 2013, primarily due to a reduction in gaming revenue for Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg of
$125.9 million primarily due to new competition, namely a new casino that opened on March 4, 2013 in Cincinnati, Ohio and to a lesser extent the opening of our own Columbus casino and a
new racino in Columbus, Ohio that opened on June 1, 2012, and decreased gaming revenue at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races of $89.7 million primarily due to the opening of a casino
complex at the Arundel Mills mall in Maryland in 2012, as well as to a lesser extent decreased gaming revenue at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course primarily due to competition and regional
economic conditions. Furthermore, Hollywood Casino Perryville experienced decreased gaming revenue of $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the corresponding
period in the prior year, primarily due to the new competition in Maryland previously mentioned, as well as the property being contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013. These decreases were
partially offset by the openings of Hollywood Casino Toledo on May 29, 2012 and Hollywood Casino Columbus on October 8, 2012, which had increased gaming revenue of $65.9 million
and $155.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

Food, beverage and other revenue

2014 Compared with 2013

Food, beverage and other revenue decreased by $29.0 million, or 6.3%, to $432.0 million in 2014, primarily due to the
variances explained below.



Food,
beverage and other revenue for our Southern Plains segment decreased by $16.8 million in 2014, primarily due to decreased food, beverage and other revenue at Hollywood
Casino St. Louis primarily due to reduced complimentaries offered to customers, and the contribution of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge to GLPI on November 1, 2013, which had
$6.4 million of food, beverage and other revenue for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.

Food,
beverage and other revenue for our East/Midwest segment decreased by $9.8 million in 2014, primarily due to decreased food, beverage and other revenue at Hollywood Casino at
Charles Town Races of $5.9 million and Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg of $6.5 million primarily due to the competition mentioned above, decreased food, beverage and other revenue at
Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course of $5.9 million primarily due to regional economic conditions and the closure of one of its OTWs in August 2013, and the contribution of Hollywood
Casino Perryville to GLPI on November 1, 2013, which had $4.0 million of food, beverage and other revenue for the ten months ended October 31, 2013, all of which were partially
offset by the acquisition of Plainridge Racecourse in 2014, which had food, beverage and other revenue of $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and the openings of Hollywood
Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course on September 17, 2014 and Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway on August 28, 2014, which together generated $6.5 million of food, beverage and
other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. The first quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year was also impacted by adverse weather on racing for Hollywood Casino at Charles Town
Races and Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course.

2013 Compared with 2012

Food, beverage and other revenue increased by $22.2 million, or 5.1%, to $461.0 million in 2013, primarily due to the
variances explained below.

Food,
beverage and other revenue for our Southern Plains segment increased by $25.8 million in 2013, primarily due to the acquisition of Harrah's St. Louis facility on
November 2, 2012, which had increased food, beverage and other revenue of $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior
year. This was partially offset by decreased food, beverage and other revenue for Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the
corresponding period in the prior year, as it was contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

Food,
beverage and other revenue for our East/Midwest segment increased by $7.1 million in 2013, primarily due to the openings of Hollywood Casino Toledo on May 29, 2012
and Hollywood Casino Columbus on October 8, 2012, which had increased food, beverage and other revenue of $6.8 million and $17.0 million, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2013, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, which was partially offset by a reduction in food, beverage and other revenue for Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg and
Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races due to previously mentioned new competition. In addition, Hollywood Casino Perryville had decreased food, beverage and other revenue of $0.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, as it was contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

Food,
beverage and other revenue for our West segment decreased by $12.5 million in 2013, primarily due to decreased food, beverage and other revenue at the M Resort due to the
sale of an on-site gas station in April 2012.

Promotional allowances

The retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross
revenues and then deducted as "promotional allowances." Our promotional allowance levels are determined based on various factors such as our marketing plans, competitive factors, economic conditions,
and regulations.



2014 Compared with 2013

Promotional allowances decreased by $20.3 million, or 11.9%, to $150.3 million in 2014, primarily due to decreased
promotional allowances at Hollywood Casino St. Louis primarily due to reduced complimentaries offered to customers, decreased promotional allowances at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg primarily
due to reduced redemptions, and the contribution of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville to GLPI on November 1, 2013, which had $4.2 million and
$1.0 million, respectively, of promotional allowances for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.

2013 Compared with 2012

Promotional allowances increased by $25.9 million or 17.9%, to $170.6 million in 2013, primarily due to the acquisition
of Harrah's St. Louis facility on November 2, 2012, which had increased promotional allowances of $22.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2013, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, as well as to a lesser extent the openings of Hollywood Casino Toledo on May 29, 2012 and Hollywood Casino Columbus on
October 8, 2012. This was partially offset by our results for the year ended December 31, 2013 only including ten months of results for Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino
Perryville, as they were contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

at these properties, decreased marketing costs at Hollywood Casino Columbus primarily due to realignment of costs, and the contribution of Hollywood Casino Perryville to GLPI on November 1,

costs associated with lower business demand, as well as the property being contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

Food, beverage and other expense

Hollywood
Casino Joliet due to cost containment measures, and the contribution of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

Food,
beverage and other expense for our East/Midwest segment decreased by $2.3 million in 2014, primarily due to decreased food, beverage and other expense at Hollywood Casino at
Charles Town Races, Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg and Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course primarily due to lower food and beverage costs and payroll costs, and the contribution of Hollywood
Casino Perryville to GLPI on November 1, 2013, all of which were partially offset by the acquisition of Plainridge Racecourse in 2014 and the openings of Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley
Race Course on September 17, 2014 and Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway on August 28, 2014. The first quarter of 2014 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was also
impacted by reduced purse expense due to adverse weather conditions at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course.

2013 Compared with 2012

Food, beverage and other expense increased by $1.7 million, or 0.5%, to $345.3 million in 2013, primarily due to the

beverage and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, as it was contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

Food,
beverage and other expense for our West segment decreased by $10.8 million in 2013, primarily due to the sale of an on-site gas station in April 2012 at the M Resort.

General and administrative expense

General and administrative expenses include items such as compliance, facility maintenance, utilities, property and liability
insurance, surveillance and security, and certain housekeeping services, as well as all expenses for administrative departments such as accounting, purchasing, human resources, legal and internal
audit. General and administrative expenses also include lobbying expenses.

2014 Compared with 2013

General and administrative expenses decreased by $80.1 million, or 15.2%, to $446.4 million in 2014, primarily due to the
variances explained below.

General
and administrative expenses for Other decreased by $55.9 million in 2014, primarily due to lower Spin-Off transaction and development costs of $30.0 million, lower
costs on cash-settled stock based awards of $13.9 million primarily due to the favorable impact from declines in GLPI's stock price
for GLPI awards held by Penn employees and the fact that certain members of Penn's executive management team transferred their employment to GLPI as part of the Spin-Off, lower stock-based
compensation costs of $12.1 million primarily due to lower aggregate executive compensation following



the
Spin-Off, and a reduction in various other items due to cost containment measures, all of which was partially offset by higher lobbying costs of $3.5 million.

General
and administrative expenses for our Southern Plains segment decreased by $23.4 million in 2014, primarily due to the contribution of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge to GLPI
on November 1, 2013, decreased rental expense for leases assigned to GLPI in conjunction with the Spin-Off, and the closure of Argosy Casino Sioux City on July 30, 2014. In addition, the
majority of our Southern Plains properties had decreased payroll costs for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

General
and administrative expenses for our West segment decreased by $3.7 million in 2014, primarily due to a termination charge associated with the Spin-Off of
$3.8 million incurred in the third quarter of 2013.

General
and administrative expenses for our East/Midwest segment increased by $2.9 million in 2014, primarily due to the openings of Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race
Course on September 17, 2014 and Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway on August 28, 2014, as well as the acquisition of Plainridge Racecourse in 2014, partially offset by the contribution
of Hollywood Casino Perryville to GLPI on November 1, 2013. In addition, the majority of our East/Midwest properties had decreased payroll costs for the year ended December 31, 2014,
compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

2013 Compared with 2012

General and administrative expenses decreased by $5.8 million, or 1.1%, to $526.5 million in 2013, primarily due to the
variances explained below.

General
and administrative expenses for Other decreased by $33.7 million in 2013, primarily due to lower lobbying expenses of $44.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, and a $6.4 million legal accrual for our Cherokee County, Kansas litigation in 2012, partially offset by
higher legal, consulting and other fees related to the pursuit of potential opportunities, including the Spin-Off transaction, of $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as
compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, were
also impacted by lower stock compensation of $5.8 million primarily due to a lower number of equity grants awarded to employees in the current year compared to the prior year as well as the
impact of the Spin-Off which reduced stock based compensation expense for employees who transferred to GLPI.

General
and administrative expenses for our Southern Plains segment increased by $22.4 million in 2013, primarily due to the acquisition of Harrah's St. Louis facility on
November 2, 2012, partially offset by Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge being contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

General
and administrative expenses for our East/Midwest segment increased by $3.7 million in 2013, primarily due to the openings of Hollywood Casino Toledo on May 29, 2012
and Hollywood Casino Columbus on October 8, 2012, which had increased general and administrative expenses of $3.4 million and $12.8 million, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2013, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by an overall decrease in payroll and other costs at our other properties in
our East/Midwest segment due to increased cost management efforts, as well as Hollywood Casino Perryville being contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

General
and administrative expenses for our West segment increased by $1.8 million in 2013, primarily due to a termination charge associated with the Spin-Off of
$3.8 million incurred in the third quarter of 2013.



Rental Expense related to the Master Lease

The Company recognized rental expense related to the Master Lease totaling $421.4 million and $69.5 million for the years
ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company allocates the rental obligation to the leased properties on a monthly basis based on their proportionate share of the total EBITDAR
generated by the leased properties (with the exception of Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course and Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway which began paying rent upon their openings in the
third quarter of 2014). Additionally, the variable rent component attributable to our Hollywood Casinos in Columbus and Toledo, Ohio (which is reassessed on a monthly basis) are allocated directly to
these two properties.

Upon
the closing of Argosy Casino Sioux City, the annual rental expense related to the Master Lease decreased by $6.2 million. In addition, upon the openings of the video lottery
terminal facilities at our two racetracks in Ohio in the third quarter of 2014, the annual rental expense related to the Master Lease increased by approximately $19 million, which approximates
ten percent of the real estate construction costs paid for by GLPI related to these facilities. Additionally, the Company finalized its calculation of rent coverage in accordance with the appropriate
provisions of the Master Lease to
determine if an annual base rent escalator is due. The calculation of the escalator resulted in an increase to our annual rent expense of $3.2 million starting November 1, 2014.

Depreciation and amortization expense

2014 Compared with 2013

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $119.3 million, or 40.0%, to $179.0 million in 2014, primarily due to
the contribution of real estate assets to GLPI, as well as Hollywood Casino Perryville and Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge, on November 1, 2013, partially offset by the openings of the two new
racinos in Ohio in the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, depreciation and amortization expense was impacted by decreased amortization at Argosy Casino Sioux City due to the ending of the
amortization of our gaming license in June 2014, which began in April 2013 with the awarding of the gaming license to another gaming operator (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial
statements for further details).

2013 Compared with 2012

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $53.0 million, or 21.6%, to $298.3 million in 2013, primarily due to
the acquisition of Harrah's St. Louis facility on November 2, 2012, the openings of Hollywood Casino Toledo on May 29, 2012 and Hollywood Casino Columbus on October 8,
2012, and increased amortization at Argosy Casino Sioux City due to the amortization of our gaming license discussed previously, all of which were partially offset by decreased depreciation expense at
Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course primarily due to assets purchased when the casino was built that had a five year useful life being fully depreciated in February 2013, only ten months of
results being included for Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville, as they were contributed to GLPI on November 1, 2013, and decreased depreciation expense due to the
contribution of real estate assets to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

Impairment losses

During the three months ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded pre-tax goodwill and other intangible assets impairment
charges of $316.5 million, respectively (totaling $253.5 million, net of taxes), as it determined that a portion of the value of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired due
to the Company's outlook of continued challenging regional gaming conditions which persisted in 2014 at certain properties in its Southern Plains segment, as well as for the write-off of a trademark
intangible asset in the West segment. The impairment charges by segment were as



follows: Southern
Plains, $315.1 million pre-tax ($252.7 million, net of taxes) and West, $1.4 million pre-tax ($0.8 million, net of taxes). During the three months
ended June 30, 2014, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $4.6 million ($2.8 million, net of taxes) in the East/Midwest segment to write-down certain idle assets to
an estimated salvage value.

During
the three months ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the Spin-Off, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $1,058.4 million ($842.9 million,
net of taxes), as we determined that a portion of the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired. The impairment charge by segment was as follows: East/Midwest,
$429.6 million pre-tax ($348.8 million, net of taxes); Southern Plains, $592.6 million pre-tax ($465.6 million, net of taxes); and Other, $36.2 million pre-tax
($28.5 million, net of taxes). The contribution of real estate to GLPI was accounted for as a contribution of assets rather than a business. Therefore, the historical goodwill and other
intangible assets of the Company (with the exception of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville since we contributed them to GLPI) were not contributed to GLPI as part of the
Spin-Off.

Additionally,
as a result of a new gaming license being awarded for the development of a new casino in Sioux City, Iowa to another applicant in April 2013, we recorded a pre-tax
impairment charge of $71.8 million ($70.5 million, net of taxes) in the Southern Plains segment for Argosy Casino Sioux City for the three months ended June 30, 2013, as we
determined that the fair value of our Sioux City reporting unit was less than its carrying amount based on the Company's analysis of the estimated future expected cash flows the Company anticipated
receiving from the operations of the Sioux City facility. In addition, in conjunction with the relocation of our two racetracks in Ohio, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $2.2 million
($1.4 million, net of taxes) in Other during the three months ended December 31, 2013 for the parcels of land that the racetracks resided on, as the land was reclassified as held for
sale.

Insurance recoveries, net of deductible charges

Insurance recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2014 were related to a pre-tax insurance gain in our Southern Plains
segment of $5.7 million for the 2013 tornado damage at Hollywood Casino St. Louis.

Insurance
deductible charges, net of recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2013 were related to a net pre-tax insurance loss in our Southern Plains segment of
$0.1 million for the tornado damage at Hollywood Casino St. Louis.

Insurance
recoveries, net of deductible charges during the year ended December 31, 2012 were related to a pre-tax insurance gain in our Southern Plains segment of
$7.2 million for the flood at Hollywood Casino Tunica.

Interest expense

Interest expense decreased by $51.1 million, or 52.6%, to $46.0 million in 2014, primarily due to lower levels of
indebtedness subsequent to the Spin-Off.

Interest
expense increased by $15.7 million, or 19.2%, to $97.1 million in 2013, primarily due to higher outstanding borrowings on our previous senior secured credit
facility primarily due to an add-on to the previous senior secured credit facility in November 2012 to fund the acquisition of Harrah's St. Louis gaming and lodging facility as well as the
gaming license fees for the Hollywood Casinos in Columbus and Toledo, which opened in 2012, and lower capitalized interest for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the corresponding
period in the prior year, which was partially offset by lower interest expense due to the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility in late October 2013 in connection with the Spin-Off.

Interest income

Interest income increased by $2.3 million, or 168.9%, to $3.7 million in 2014, primarily due to higher interest accrued
on the note receivable with the Jamul Tribe (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further details).

Income from unconsolidated affiliates

Income from unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $1.7 million, or 17.7%, to $7.9 million in 2014, primarily due to our
portion of the loss in the joint venture with Cordish Companies in New York. We anticipate this joint venture will be dissolved in 2015 and our investment has been written down to zero at
December 31, 2014.

Income
from unconsolidated affiliates increased by $5.9 million, or 153.9%, to $9.7 million in 2013, primarily due to increased earnings related to our joint venture in
Kansas Entertainment primarily due to growth in its market share as well as a favorable property tax settlement for Kansas Entertainment of $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2013.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a $61.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to
debt issuance costs write-offs for the 2013 refinancing of our previous senior secured credit facility and redemption of the $325 million 8


/


% senior subordinated notes, the
call premium on the $325 million 8


/


% senior subordinated notes of $34.7 million, and the write-off of the discount on the Term Loan B facility of the previous senior
secured credit facility.

Other

Other changed by $5.2 million, or 376.6%, to $3.8 million in 2013, primarily due to increased foreign currency
translation gains for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the



corresponding
period in the prior year, as well as a gain on redemption of corporate debt securities of $1.5 million in 2013.

Taxes

Our effective tax rate (income taxes as a percentage of income from operations before income taxes) was a tax benefit of 14.2% for the
year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to a tax benefit of 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a significant year-over-year reduction in pre-tax earnings
which has magnified the impact on non-deductible expenses such as lobbying, increases in reserves for uncertain tax positions, and a decrease in the non-deductible portion of our goodwill and other
intangible assets impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

Our
effective tax rate was a tax benefit of 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to a tax provision of 41.8% for the year ended December 31, 2012,
primarily due to incurring a pre-tax loss in 2013, partially offset by the non-deductible portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges during the year ended
December 31, 2013.

Our
effective income tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings and the level of our tax credits. Certain
of these and other factors, including our history and projections of pre-tax earnings, are taken into account in assessing our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically and prospectively, our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been and will be cash flow from operations,
borrowings from banks and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities.

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $220.0 million, $440.8 million, and $507.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities of $220.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year,
was comprised primarily of a decrease in cash receipts from customers of $318.5 million and increased rental expense related to the Master Lease, which was effective November 1, 2013, of
$351.9 million, both of which were partially offset by a decrease in cash paid to suppliers and vendors of $241.9 million, cash paid to employees of $60.0 million, interest
payments of $65.3 million, and income tax payments of $46.6 million, as well as cash payments made in 2013 for the early extinguishment of debt, primarily the call premiums previously
mentioned, of $34.9 million. The decrease in cash receipts collected from our customers and the decrease in cash payments for operating expenses and to employees for the year ended
December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year was primarily due to new and continued competition on our operations, in particular in our East/Midwest and Southern Plains segments, the
contribution of Hollywood Casino Perryville and Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge to GLPI on November 1, 2013, the closure of Argosy Casino Sioux City in our Southern Plains segment on
July 30, 2014, lower payroll costs due to cost containment measures, and lower general and administrative expenses for Other of $33.7 million. The decrease in interest payments for the
year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower levels of indebtedness subsequent to the Spin-Off. The decrease in income tax payments for the year ended
December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a significant decline in taxable earnings excluding the non-recurring impairment charges in both periods.

Net
cash used in investing activities totaled $375.5 million, $415.0 million, and $1,188.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. The decrease in net cash used in investing
activities of $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was primarily due to cash distributed to GLPI in connection



with
the Spin-Off of $240.2 million in 2013, partially offset by our Massachusetts gaming license payment of $25.0 million in March 2014, the acquisition of Plainridge Racecourse in
April 2014 for $42.4 million, $50.0 million in gaming license fees paid in 2014 related to the new Ohio facilities, and advances to the Jamul Tribe of $47.1 million (see
Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements) in 2014. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the corresponding period in the prior
year, was also impacted by increased capital project expenditures of $25.7 million primarily due to the development of Plainridge Park Casino, which is expected to open in June 2015, as well as
a new hotel at Zia Park Casino and the new Ohio facilities, all of which opened in the third quarter of 2014, partially offset by residual payments made related to Hollywood Casino Columbus and
Hollywood Casino Toledo as well as the rebranding of our St. Louis facility in 2013.

Net
cash provided by financing activities totaled $71.2 million, $6.7 million, and $703.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities of $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was
primarily due to the repurchases of preferred stock for $649.5 million in 2013, partially offset by lower proceeds from the exercise of options of $41.7 million and lower net proceeds on
our long-term debt of $555.3 million.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures are accounted for as either capital project or capital maintenance (replacement) expenditures. Capital project
expenditures are for fixed asset additions that expand an existing facility or create a new facility. Capital maintenance expenditures are expenditures to replace existing fixed assets with a useful
life greater than one year that are obsolete, worn out or no longer cost effective to repair.

(3)

Capital
expenditures in our Southern Plains segment were for the construction costs of the Hollywood Casino St. Louis rebranding project that was
completed in December 2013.

In
June 2012, we announced that we had filed applications with the Ohio Lottery Commission for Video Lottery Sales Agent Licenses for our Ohio racetracks, Raceway Park and Beulah Park,
and with the Ohio State Racing Commission for permission to relocate the racetracks to Dayton and Austintown, respectively. On May 1, 2013, we received approval from the Ohio Racing Commission
for our relocation plans. Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course opened on September 17, 2014. The new Hollywood-themed facility in Austintown, with a $161 million budget,
inclusive of a $75 million relocation fee and $50 million license fee, features a new thoroughbred racetrack and 866 video lottery terminals, as



well
as various restaurants, bars and other amenities. The new Austintown facility is located on 193 acres in Austintown's Centrepointe Business Park near the intersection of Interstate 80 and Ohio
Route 46. Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway opened on August 28, 2014. The new Hollywood-themed facility in Dayton, with a $165 million budget, inclusive of a $75 million
relocation fee and $50 million license fee, features a new standardbred racetrack and 984 video lottery terminals, as well as various restaurants, bars and other amenities. The Dayton facility
is located on 119 acres on the site of an abandoned Delphi Automotive plant near Wagner Ford and Needmore roads in North Dayton. The $75 million relocation fee for each Ohio racetrack is based
on the present value of the contractual obligation, of which $7.5 million was paid upon opening, with 18 additional semi-annual payments of $4.8 million due beginning one year after
opening. For the license fee for each Ohio racetrack, we paid $10 million in the second quarter of 2014 as well as $15 million upon opening and will pay the remaining license fee of
$25 million on the one year anniversary of the commencement of gaming. As of December 31, 2014, Penn incurred cumulative costs of $66.4 million and $62.5 million for the
Austintown facility and the Dayton facility, respectively, which includes the payments made to date for the relocation fee and license fee previously mentioned. As part of the Spin-Off, GLPI was
responsible for certain real estate related construction costs for the Austintown facility and the Dayton facility, and as such, these facilities are now subject to the Master Lease.

On
February 28, 2014, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission awarded the Company a Category Two slots-only gaming license, and on March 14, 2014, the Company broke ground on
the development of Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville, Massachusetts. Plainridge Park Casino is anticipated to be a $225 million (including licensing fees) fully integrated racing and gaming
facility featuring live harness racing and simulcasting with 1,250 gaming devices, various dining and entertainment options, structured and surface parking, and a two story clubhouse with
approximately 55,000 square feet. We expect Plainridge Park Casino to open in June 2015. As of December 31, 2014, total cumulative costs were $115.7 million, which includes a
$25 million gaming license fee, which was paid in March 2014, and the acquisition of Plainridge Racecourse for $42.4 million, which was paid in April 2014 (see Note 6 to the
consolidated financial statements).

During
the year ended December 31, 2014, we spent $83.4 million for capital maintenance expenditures, with $32.3 million at our East/Midwest segment,
$7.2 million at our West segment, $40.7 million at our Southern Plains segment, and $3.2 million for Other. The majority of the capital maintenance expenditures were for slot
machines and slot machine equipment.

Jamul Tribe

Note receivable to the Jamul Tribe, which totaled $62.0 million at December 31, 2014, is accounted for as a loan in other
assets on the consolidated balance sheet and as such is not included in the capital expenditures table presented above. The budget for this development project is $360 million. We expect the
project to be completed in mid-2016 which will include the construction of a three-story gaming and entertainment facility of approximately 200,000 square feet featuring over 1,700 slot machines, 43
live table games, including poker, multiple restaurants, bars and lounges and a partially enclosed parking structure with over 1,800 spaces.

Cash
generated from operations and cash available under the revolving credit facility portion of our senior secured credit facility funded our capital projects, capital maintenance
expenditures and the Jamul Tribe project in 2014.

Debt

Senior Secured Credit Facility

On October 30, 2013, the Company entered into a new senior secured credit facility. This facility consists of a five year
$500 million revolver, a five year $500 million Term Loan A facility, and a seven year $250 million Term Loan B facility. The Term Loan A facility was priced at LIBOR plus a
spread (ranging from 2.75% to 1.25%) based on the Company's consolidated total net leverage ratio as defined in the new senior secured credit facility. The Term Loan B facility was priced at LIBOR
plus 2.50%, with a 0.75% LIBOR floor. In connection with the repayment of the previous senior secured credit facility, the Company recorded a $21.5 million loss on the early extinguishment of
debt for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to debt issuance costs write-offs and the write-off of the discount on the Term Loan B facility of the previous senior secured credit facility.

The
Company's senior secured credit facility had a gross outstanding balance of $807.5 million at December 31, 2014, consisting of a $475.0 million Term Loan A
facility, a $247.5 million Term Loan B facility, and $85.0 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. This compares with a $750 million gross outstanding balance at
December 31, 2013 which consisted of a $500 million Term Loan A facility and a $250 million Term Loan B facility. No balances were outstanding on the revolving credit facility at
December 31, 2013. Additionally, at December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company was contingently obligated under letters of credit issued pursuant to the senior secured credit facility with
face amounts aggregating $23.0 million and $22.1 million, respectively, resulting in $392.0 million and $477.9 million of available borrowing capacity as of
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, under the revolving credit facility.

The
payment and performance of obligations under the senior secured credit facility are guaranteed by a lien on and security interest in substantially all of the cash, equity and
personal property (other than excluded property such as gaming licenses) of the Company and its subsidiaries.

Redemption of 8


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes

In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company redeemed all of its $325 million 8


/


% senior subordinated notes,
which were due in 2019 ("8


/


% Notes"). In connection with this redemption, the Company recorded a $40.2 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt for the year ended
December 31, 2013 related to debt issuance costs write-offs of $5.5 million and the call premium on the 8


/


% Notes of $34.7 million.



5.875% Senior Unsecured Notes

On October 30, 2013, the Company completed an offering of $300 million 5.875% senior unsecured notes that mature on
November 1, 2021 (the "5.875% Notes") at a price of par. Interest on the 5.875% Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The 5.875% Notes are senior unsecured
obligations of the Company. The 5.875% Notes will not be guaranteed by any of the Company's subsidiaries except in the event that the Company in the future issues certain subsidiary-guaranteed debt
securities. The Company may redeem the 5.875% Notes at any time, and from time to time, on or after November 1, 2016, at the declining redemption premiums set forth in the indenture governing
the 5.875% Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Prior to November 1, 2016, the Company may redeem the 5.875% Notes at any time, and from
time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 5.875% Notes redeemed plus a "make-whole" redemption premium described in the indenture governing the 5.875% Notes,
together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, the 5.875% Notes may be redeemed prior to November 1, 2016 from net proceeds raised in
connection with an equity offering as long as the Company pays 105.875% of the principal amount of the 5.875% Notes, redeems the 5.875% Notes within 180 days of completing the equity offering,
and at least 60% of the 5.875% Notes originally issued remains outstanding.

The
Company used the proceeds of the new senior secured credit facility, new 5.875% Notes, and cash on hand, to repay its previous senior secured credit facility, to fund the cash tender
offer to purchase any and all of its 8


/


% Notes and the related consent solicitation to make certain amendments to the indenture governing the 8


/


% Notes, to satisfy
and discharge such indenture, to pay related fees and expenses and for working capital purposes.

GLPI indebtedness

Immediately before the Spin-Off on October 30, 2013, while GLPI was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, GLPI raised
$2.35 billion of debt financing, which was part of the net assets contributed to GLPI as part of the Spin-Off. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Other Long-Term Obligations

Other long term obligations at December 31, 2014 of $154.2 million include $19.2 million for the contingent
purchase price consideration related to the purchase of Plainridge Racecourse (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements) and $135.0 million related to the relocation fees for
Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course (See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). At the time of acquisition, the fair value of the
contingent purchase price consideration was determined to be $18.5 million based on an income approach from the Company's internal earning projections and was discounted at a rate consistent
with the risk a third party market participant would require holding the identical instrument as an asset. At each reporting period, the Company assesses the fair value of this obligation and changes
in its value are recorded in earnings. The relocation fee for each facility is payable as follows: $7.5 million upon the opening of the facility and eighteen semi-annual payments of
$4.8 million beginning one year from the commencement of operations. This obligation was measured at its present value and is accreted to interest expense at an effective yield of 5.0%. The
amount included in interest expense related to other long-term obligations was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

In
September 2012, the Company received $10 million under a subscription agreement entered into between A3 Gaming Investments, LLC, an investment vehicle owned by the
previous owner of the M Resort ("A3 Gaming Investments"), and LV Gaming Ventures, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and holder of the assets of the M Resort ("LV
Gaming Ventures"). The subscription



agreement
entitled A3 Gaming Investments to invest in a limited liability membership interest in LV Gaming Ventures, which was scheduled to mature on October 1, 2016. The investment entitled A3
Gaming Investments to annual payments and a settlement value based on the earnings levels of the M Resort. In accordance with ASC 480, "Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity," the Company
determined that this obligation was a financial instrument and as such should be recorded as a liability within debt. Changes in the settlement value, if any, were accreted to interest expense through
the maturity date of the instrument. In September 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to terminate the subscription agreement, which was repaid on October 22, 2013 for
$16 million. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded a charge of $3.8 million, and $2.2 million in interest expense on this instrument.

Covenants

The Company's senior secured credit facility and 5.875% Notes require us, among other obligations, to maintain specified financial
ratios and to satisfy certain financial tests, including fixed charge coverage, interest coverage, senior leverage and total leverage ratios. In addition, the Company's senior secured credit facility
and 5.875% Notes restrict, among other things, its ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur guarantee obligations, amend debt instruments, pay dividends, create liens on assets, make
investments, engage in mergers or consolidations, and otherwise restrict corporate activities.

At
December 31, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all required financial covenants.

Outlook

The Spin-Off has had and will continue to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, capital structure and
management. For a discussion of these impacts, see "Spin-Off of Real Estate Assets through a Real Estate Investment Trust" and "Risk Factors" of this report. Based on our current level of operations,
we believe that cash generated from operations and cash on hand, together with amounts available under our senior secured credit facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated rental obligation,
debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future. However, we cannot be certain that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from
operations, that our anticipated earnings projections will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available under our senior secured credit facility or otherwise will be available to enable us
to service our indebtedness, including the senior secured credit facility and the $300 million
5.875% senior unsecured notes, to retire or redeem the $300 million 5.875% senior unsecured notes when required or to make anticipated capital expenditures. In addition, we expect a majority of
our future growth to come from acquisitions of gaming properties at reasonable valuations, greenfield projects, jurisdictional expansions and property expansion in under-penetrated markets. If we
consummate significant acquisitions in the future or undertake any significant property expansions, our cash requirements may increase significantly and we may need to make additional borrowings or
complete equity or debt financings to meet these requirements. Our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance our debt will be subject to future economic conditions and to
financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Capital Structure" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a
discussion of the risks related to our capital structure.

We
have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing. We vary our leverage to pursue opportunities in the marketplace and in an effort to
maximize our enterprise value for our shareholders. We expect to meet our debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from operations and/or refinancing them through the debt
or equity markets prior to their maturity.

(1)

The
interest rates associated with the variable rate components of our senior secured credit facility are estimated, based on the forward LIBOR curves plus
the current spread based on our current levels of indebtedness over LIBOR as of December 31, 2014. The contractual amounts to be paid on our variable rate obligations are affected by changes in
market interest rates and changes in our spreads which are based on our leverage ratios. Future changes in such ratios will impact the contractual amounts to be paid.

The
Company anticipates spending approximately $121.9 million for future construction projects over the next year, of which the Company has been
contractually committed to spend approximately $18.3 million at year-end.

clarifications from the State of Ohio with respect to various financial matters and limits on competition within the ten year time period. This amount also includes the remaining portion of the
license fees and relocation fees to be paid associated with our two new facilities in Dayton and Mahoning Valley, Ohio (See Note 9 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).

(5)

Primarily
represents liabilities associated with reward programs that can be redeemed for cash, free play or services. Does not include any liability for
unrecognized tax benefits, as the Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Additionally, it does not include an
estimate of the payments associated with our



contingent
obligation to the former owners of Plainridge Racecourse (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements), as these amounts will be determined based on the annual performance of
this facility once it becomes operational.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2014, the FASB issued guidance that amends the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations
reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. Examples of a strategic shift
that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results could include a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method
investment, or other major parts of an entity. In addition, the amended guidance requires expanded disclosures for discontinued operations, including disclosures about a disposal of an individually
significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements. The amendments are effective for all disposals (or classifications as
held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted, but only
for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. The Company early adopted this revised guidance and
will apply the amendments to all disposals of a component of the Company going forward.

In
May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance, which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity
should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods
or services. To achieve the core principle, the new guidance implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the
nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is prohibited. Entities can transition to the new guidance either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment
as of the date of adoption. Management is currently assessing the impact the new revenue recognition guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.



ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The table below provides information at December 31, 2014 about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in
interest rates. For debt obligations, the table presents notional amounts maturing during the year and the related weighted-average interest rates by maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to
calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged by maturity date and the weighted-average interest rates are based on implied forward LIBOR rates at December 31, 2014.

ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board
of Directors

Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Penn National Gaming, Inc. and
Subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.     Business and Basis of Presentation

Penn National Gaming, Inc. ("Penn") and together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") is a diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and
manager of gaming and pari-mutuel properties. Penn is the successor to several businesses that have operated as Penn National Race Course since 1972. Penn was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1982 as
PNRC Corp. and adopted its current name in 1994, when the Company became a publicly traded company. In 1997, the Company began its transition from a pari-mutuel company to a diversified gaming company
with the acquisition of the Charles Town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in West Virginia. Since 1997, the Company has continued to expand its gaming operations through
strategic acquisitions, greenfield projects, and property expansions. The Company, along with its joint venture partner, opened Hollywood Casino at
Kansas Speedway on February 3, 2012. In Ohio, the Company opened four new gaming properties over the last three years, including: Hollywood Casino Toledo on May 29, 2012, Hollywood
Casino Columbus on October 8, 2012, Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway on August 28, 2014, and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course on September 17, 2014. In addition,
on November 2, 2012, the Company acquired Harrah's St. Louis, which the Company subsequently rebranded as Hollywood Casino St. Louis.

As
of December 31, 2014, the Company owned, managed, or had ownership interests in twenty-six facilities in the following seventeen jurisdictions: Florida, Illinois, Indiana,
Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Ontario. On July 30, 2014, the Company closed its
facility in Sioux City, Iowa. In addition, Beulah Park and Raceway Park in Ohio were closed as the racetracks were relocated to Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course and Hollywood Gaming at
Dayton Raceway, respectively, both of which opened in the third quarter of 2014.

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses for the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. For purposes of comparability, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

2.     Spin-Off of Real Estate Assets through a Real Estate Investment Trust

On November 1, 2013, the Company completed its plan to separate its gaming operating assets from its real property assets by creating a newly formed,
publicly traded real estate investment trust ("REIT"), known as Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. ("GLPI"), through a tax free spin-off (the "Spin-Off"). Penn effected the Spin-Off by
distributing one share of common stock of GLPI to the holders of Penn common stock and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series C Preferred Stock") for every share of Penn common
stock and every 1/1000th of a share of Series C Preferred Stock that they held at the close of business on October 16, 2013, the record date for the Spin-Off. See Note 14
for further information on the Series C Preferred Stock. Peter M. Carlino and the PMC Delaware Dynasty Trust dated September 25, 2013, a trust for the benefit of Mr. Carlino's
children, also received additional shares of GLPI common stock, in exchange for shares of Penn common stock that they transferred to Penn immediately prior to the Spin-Off, and Mr. Carlino
exchanged certain options to acquire Penn common stock for options to acquire GLPI common stock having the same aggregate intrinsic value. Penn engaged in these exchanges with Mr. Carlino and
his related trust to ensure that each member of the Carlino family beneficially owns 9.9% or less of the outstanding shares of Penn



common
stock following the Spin-Off, so that GLPI can qualify to be taxed as a REIT for United States ("U.S.") federal income tax purposes.

In
addition, through a series of internal corporate restructurings, Penn contributed to GLPI substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with Penn's real property
interests and real estate development business, as well as all of the assets and liabilities of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville, which are referred to as the "TRS
Properties." The assets and liabilities were contributed to GLPI based on their historical carrying values, which were as follows (in thousands):

As
a result of the Spin-Off, GLPI owns substantially all of Penn's former real property assets and leases back those assets (other than the TRS Properties) to Penn for use by its
subsidiaries, under a "triple net" master lease agreement (the "Master Lease") (which has a fifteen-year initial term that can be extended at Penn's option for up to four five-year renewal terms), as
well as owns and operates the TRS Properties. Penn continues to operate the leased gaming facilities and hold the associated gaming licenses with these facilities.

On
November 1, 2013, Penn entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with GLPI, which governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of the two companies after the
Spin-Off with respect to payment of tax liabilities, entitlement of refunds, and filing of tax returns and sets forth certain covenants and indemnities. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, Penn was
required to prepare and file a federal consolidated income tax return for 2013, which included a combination of Penn and GLPI legal entities for the activity prior to the Spin-Off, with any
adjustments for the impact of the final consolidated income tax return recorded to either shareholders' equity or the statement of income depending on the specific item giving rise to the adjustment.
In conjunction with the filing of the final 2013 federal consolidated income tax return with the Internal Revenue Service, Penn recorded an increase to shareholders' equity of $0.1 million
during the year ended December 31, 2014.

The
Company incurred transaction costs of $0.9 million, $28.8 million, and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively,
associated with the Spin-Off, which were included in general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statements of operations.

The
Company received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service relating to the tax treatment of the separation and the qualification of GLPI as a REIT. The private letter
ruling is
subject to certain qualifications and based on certain representations and statements made by the Company and certain of its shareholders. If such representations and statements are untrue or
incomplete in any material respect (including as a result of a material change in the transaction or other relevant facts), the Company may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling. The
Company



received
opinions from outside counsel regarding certain aspects of the transaction that are not covered by the private letter ruling.

3.     Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Penn and its subsidiaries. Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates, that do not meet
the consolidation criteria of the authoritative guidance for voting interest, controlling interest or variable interest entities ("VIEs"), are accounted for under the equity method. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

4.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all cash balances and highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and
cash equivalents.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, corporate debt securities, and
accounts receivable.

The
Company's policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution, and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being creditworthy, or in
short-term money market and tax-free bond funds which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risk. The Company has bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements that exceed
federally-insured limits.

Concentration
of credit risk, with respect to casino receivables, is limited through the Company's credit evaluation process. The Company issues markers to approved casino customers only
following credit checks and investigations of creditworthiness. Marker balances issued to approved casino customers were $4.9 million at December 31, 2014, compared to
$4.3 million at December 31, 2013.

The
Company's receivables of $41.6 million and $52.5 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily consist of $4.6 million and
$4.8 million, respectively, due from the West Virginia Lottery for gaming revenue settlements and capital reinvestment projects at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, $6.8 million
and $10.3 million, respectively, for reimbursement of expenses paid on behalf of Casino Rama, $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively, for racing settlements due from
simulcasting at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, $2.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively, for reimbursement of payroll expenses paid on behalf of the Company's joint
venture in Kansas, and markers issued to customers mentioned above. For 2013, receivables included $6.5 million of tax obligations that were reimbursed by GLPI in 2014.

Accounts
are written off when management determines that an account is uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An allowance for doubtful
accounts is determined to reduce the Company's receivables to their carrying value, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on historical collection experience, specific review
of individual customer accounts, and current economic and business conditions. Historically, the Company has not incurred any significant credit-related losses.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs that neither add materially to the
value of the asset nor appreciably prolong its useful life are charged



to
expense as incurred. Gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment are included in the determination of income.

Depreciation
of property and equipment is recorded using the straight- line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Land improvements

15 years

Building and improvements

5 to 31 years

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment

3 to 31 years

All
construction costs funded by Penn considered to be an improvement to the real property assets leased from GLPI under the Master Lease are recorded as leasehold improvements.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the related lease term.

The
estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as the Company's current operating strategy.

The
Company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by the Company in performing this assessment
include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. For purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 360, "Property, Plant, and Equipment," assets are grouped at the individual property level
representing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. In assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and
equipment, the Company must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record an
impairment loss for these assets. Such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non-cash component of operating income.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

At December 31, 2014, the Company had $277.6 million in goodwill and $370.6 million in other intangible assets
within its consolidated balance sheet, representing 12.4% and 16.6% of total assets, respectively, resulting from the Company's acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses. Two
issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment: (i) the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation; and
(ii) the ongoing evaluation for impairment.

In
connection with the Company's acquisitions, valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices. The factors considered in the valuations include data gathered
as a result of the Company's due diligence in connection with the acquisitions, projections for future operations, and data obtained from third-party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate.
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits of a business combination measured as the excess purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually, or more
frequently if indicators of impairment exist, in two steps. In step 1 of the impairment test, the current fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model which is
then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value in step 1 of the impairment test, then step 2 of the impairment test is
performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill for that reporting unit. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the goodwill allocated for that reporting unit, an impairment is
recognized.



In
accordance with ASC 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other," the Company considers its gaming licenses and other various intangible assets as indefinite-life intangible assets that do
not require amortization based on the Company's future expectations to operate its gaming facilities indefinitely (notwithstanding the recent events in Iowa which the Company concluded was an isolated
incident and the first time in the Company's history a gaming regulator has taken an action which could cause it to lose its gaming license) as well as its historical experience in renewing these
intangible assets at minimal cost with various state commissions. Rather, these intangible assets are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, by comparing
the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount. If the carrying amounts of the indefinite-life intangible assets exceed their fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The Company
completes its testing of its intangible assets prior to assessing the realizability of its goodwill.

The
Company assessed the fair value of its indefinite-life intangible assets (which are primarily gaming licenses) using the Greenfield Method under the income approach. The Greenfield
Method estimates the fair value of the license using a discounted cash flow model assuming the Company built a casino with similar utility to that of the existing facility. The method assumes a
theoretical start-up company going into business without any assets other than the intangible asset being valued. As such, the value of the license is a function of the following
items:

•

Projected revenues and operating cash flows (including an allocation of the Company's projected rental obligation to its reporting
units);

•

Theoretical construction costs and duration;

•

Pre-opening expenses;

•

Discounting that reflects the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows attributable to the license; and

•

Remaining useful life of the license.

The
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine the estimated fair value
of the reporting unit and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company must make various assumptions and estimates in performing its impairment testing. The implied fair value includes
estimates of future cash flows (including an allocation of the Company's projected rental obligation to its reporting units) that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent
the Company's best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets including their eventual disposition. Changes in estimates, increases in the Company's cost of capital,
reductions in transaction multiples, changes in operating and capital expenditure assumptions or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results.
Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from the Company's estimates. If the Company's ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met,
the Company may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods. The Company's estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory and economic climates, recent
operating information and budgets of the various properties where it conducts operations. These estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state or local regulations, economic
downturns, or other events affecting the Company's properties.

Forecasted
cash flows (based on the Company's annual operating plan as determined in the fourth quarter) can be significantly impacted by the local economy in which its reporting units
operate. For example, increases in unemployment rates can result in decreased customer visitations and/or lower customer spend per visit. In addition, the impact of new legislation which approves
gaming in nearby jurisdictions or further expands gaming in jurisdictions where the Company's reporting units currently operate can result in opportunities for the Company to expand its operations.
However, it also has the



impact
of increasing competition for the Company's established properties which generally will have a negative effect on those locations' profitability once competitors become established as a certain
level of cannibalization occurs absent an overall increase in customer visitations. Lastly, increases in gaming taxes approved by state regulatory bodies can negatively impact forecasted cash flows.

Assumptions
and estimates about future cash flow levels and multiples by individual reporting units are complex and subjective. They are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions
and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as industry, geopolitical and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in the Company's business strategy,
which may reallocate capital and resources to different or new opportunities which management believes will enhance its overall value but may be to the detriment of an individual reporting unit.

Once
an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite-life intangible assets has been recorded, it cannot be reversed. Because the Company's goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets
are not amortized, there may be volatility in reported income because impairment losses, if any, are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts. Intangible assets that have a definite-life are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or related service contract. The Company reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets that have a definite-life for possible
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the intangible assets that have a definite-life exceed their
fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs that are incurred by the Company in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest
expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the underlying indebtedness.

Other Comprehensive Income

The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with ASC 220, "Comprehensive Income," which establishes standards for the
reporting and presentation of comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements. The Company presents comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements. The net of tax
changes in accumulated other comprehensive income by component were as follows (in thousands):

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes" ("ASC 740"). Under ASC 740, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and



liabilities
and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized. ASC 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a
valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
realizability of the net deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance, if necessary. The Company
considers all available positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
The evaluation of both positive and negative evidence is a requirement pursuant to ASC 740 in determining more-likely-than-not the net deferred tax assets will be realized. In the event the Company
determines that the deferred income tax assets would be realized in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded, which would reduce
the provision for income taxes.

ASC
740 also creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions, and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial
statements by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. It also provides guidance on
derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is included in noncurrent tax
liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2014 and 2013.

Revenue Recognition and Promotional Allowances

Gaming revenue consists mainly of slot and video lottery gaming machine revenue as well as to a lesser extent table game and poker
revenue. Gaming revenue is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs, for "ticket-in,
ticket-out" coupons in the customers' possession, and for accruals related to the anticipated payout of progressive jackpots. Progressive slot machines, which contain base jackpots that increase at a
progressive rate based on the number of coins played, are charged to revenue as the amount of the jackpots increases. Table game revenue is the aggregate of table drop adjusted for the change in
aggregate table chip inventory. Table drop is the total dollar amount of the currency, coins, chips, tokens and outstanding markers (credit instruments) that are removed from the live gaming tables.

Food,
beverage and other revenue, including racing revenue, is recognized as services are performed. Racing revenue includes the Company's share of pari-mutuel wagering on live races
after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers, its share of wagering from import and export simulcasting, and its share of wagering from its off-track wagering facilities ("OTWs').

Revenue
from the management service contract for Casino Rama is based upon contracted terms and is recognized when services are performed.

Revenues
are recognized net of certain sales incentives in accordance with ASC 605-50, "Revenue Recognition—Customer Payments and Incentives." The Company records certain
sales incentives and points earned in point-loyalty programs as a reduction of revenue.

The
retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenues and then deducted as promotional allowances.
The estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is primarily included in food, beverage and other expense.

Gaming and Racing Taxes

The Company is subject to gaming and pari-mutuel taxes based on gross gaming revenue and pari-mutuel revenue in the jurisdictions in
which it operates. The Company primarily recognizes gaming and pari-mutuel tax expense based on the statutorily required percentage of revenue that is required to be paid to state and local
jurisdictions in the states where or in which wagering occurs. In certain states in which the Company operates, gaming taxes are based on graduated rates. The Company records gaming tax expense at the
Company's estimated effective gaming tax rate for the year, considering estimated taxable gaming revenue and the applicable rates. Such estimates are adjusted each interim period. If gaming tax rates
change during the year, such changes are applied prospectively in the determination of gaming tax expense in future interim periods. Finally, the Company recognizes purse expense based on the
statutorily required percentage of revenue that is required to be paid out in the form of purses to the winning owners of horse races run at the Company's racetracks in the period in which wagering
occurs. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, these expenses, which are recorded primarily within gaming expense in the consolidated statements of operations, were
$0.89 billion, $1.02 billion, and $1.07 billion, respectively.

Rental Expense related to the Master Lease

As of December 31, 2014, the Company leased from GLPI real property assets associated with eighteen of the Company's gaming and
related facilities used in the Company's operations.

The
rent structure under the Master Lease, which became effective November 1, 2013, includes a fixed component, a portion of which is subject to an annual escalator of up to 2% if
certain rent coverage ratio thresholds are met, and a component that is based on the performance of the facilities, which is prospectively adjusted, subject to a floor of zero (i) every five
years by an amount equal to 4% of the average change to net revenues of all facilities under the Master Lease (other than Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo) during the preceding
five years, and (ii) monthly by an amount equal to 20% of the change in net revenues of Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo during the preceding month. In addition, with the
openings of Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course in the third quarter of 2014, these properties began paying rent subject to the terms of the Master
Lease, which had the impact of



increasing
the Company's annual rental expense related to the Master Lease by approximately $19 million, which approximates ten percent of the real estate construction costs paid for by GLPI
related to these facilities.

In
April 2014, an amendment to the Master Lease was entered into in order to revise certain provisions relating to the Sioux City property. In accordance with the amendment, upon the
ceasing of gaming operations at Argosy Casino Sioux City on July 30, 2014 due to the termination of its gaming license, the annual rent payable to GLPI was reduced by $6.2 million.
Additionally, the Company finalized its calculation of rent coverage in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Master Lease to determine if an annual base rent escalator is due. The
calculation of the escalator resulted in an increase to the Company's annual rent expense of $3.2 million starting November 1, 2014.

The
Master Lease is commonly known as a triple-net lease. Accordingly, in addition to rent, the Company is required to pay the following, among other things: (1) all facility
maintenance; (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased
properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); and (4) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased
properties. At the Company's option, the Master Lease may
be extended for up to four five-year renewal terms beyond the initial fifteen-year term, on the same terms and conditions.

Total
rental expense under the Master Lease was $421.4 million and $69.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Earnings Per Share

The Company calculates earnings per share ("EPS") in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings Per Share" ("ASC 260"). Basic EPS is computed
by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the additional dilution for all
potentially-dilutive securities such as stock options and unvested restricted shares.

At
December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had outstanding 8,624 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and at December 31, 2012, had outstanding 12,275 of
Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred Stock"). The Company determined that both classes of preferred stock qualified as a participating security as defined in ASC 260
since these securities participate in dividends with the Company's common stock. In accordance with ASC 260, a company is required to use the two-class method when computing EPS when a company has a
security that qualifies as a "participating security." The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating security according to
dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. A participating security is included in the computation of basic EPS using the two-class method. Under the
two-class method, basic EPS for the Company's common stock is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
EPS for the Company's common stock is computed using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the if-converted method.

Since
the Company's preferred shareholders are not obligated to fund the losses of the Company nor is the contractual principal of the Series C Preferred Stock reduced as a result
of losses incurred by the Company, no allocation of the Company's undistributed losses resulting from the net loss for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is required. As such, since the
Company reported a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, it was required by ASC 260 to use basic weighted-average common shares outstanding, rather than diluted
weighted-average common shares outstanding, when calculating diluted EPS.



The following table sets forth the allocation of net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 under the two-class method:

For
the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company was required to adjust its diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding for the purpose of calculating diluted EPS as follows:
1) when the price of the Company's common stock at the end of the reporting period was less than $45, the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding was increased by 26,777,778 shares
(regardless of how much the stock price was below $45); 2) when the price of the Company's common stock at the end of the reporting period was between $45 and $67, the diluted weighted-average
common shares outstanding was increased by an amount which was calculated by dividing $1.205 billion (face value) by the current price per share of the Company's common stock, which resulted in
an increase in the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding of between 17,985,075 shares and 26,777,778 shares; and 3) when the price of the Company's common stock at the end of the
reporting period was above $67, the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding was increased by 17,985,075 shares (regardless of how much the stock price exceeded $67).

Options
to purchase 6,633,622 shares, 7,316,713 shares and 1,693,500 shares were outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, but were not
included in the computation of diluted EPS because they were antidilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock compensation under ASC 718, "Compensation-Stock Compensation," which requires the Company to expense the
cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. This expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period
following the date of grant.

The
fair value for stock options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires management to make certain assumptions. The risk-free
interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury spot rate with a term equal to the expected life assumed at the
date of grant. Expected volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock price over a period of 5.45 years, in order to match the expected life of the options
at the grant date. The decline in the weighted average expected life compared to the prior years is due to the fact that the Company did not issue stock options in 2013 as well as lower amounts of
stock options issued compared to years prior to 2013. Historically, at the grant date, there has been no expected dividend yield assumption since the Company has not paid any cash dividends on its
common stock since its initial public offering in May 1994 and since the Company intends to retain all of its earnings to finance the development of its business for the foreseeable future. The
weighted-average expected life was based on the contractual term of the stock option and expected employee exercise dates, which was based on the historical and expected exercise behavior of the
Company's employees.

The
following are the weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:

Segment Information

The Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") as that term is defined in ASC 280,
"Segment Reporting" ("ASC 280"), measures and assesses the Company's business performance based on regional operations of various properties grouped together based primarily on their geographic
locations. In January 2014, the Company named Jay Snowden as its Chief Operating Officer and the Company decided in connection with this announcement to re-align its reporting structure. Starting in
January 2014, the Company's reportable segments are: (i) East/Midwest, (ii) West, and (iii) Southern Plains.



The
East/Midwest reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, Hollywood Casino Bangor, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course,
Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, Hollywood Casino Toledo, which opened on May 29, 2012, Hollywood Casino Columbus, which opened on October 8, 2012, Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway,
which opened on August 28, 2014, and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course, which opened on September 17, 2014. It also includes the Company's Casino Rama management service
contract and the Plainville project in Massachusetts which the Company expects to open in June 2015. It also previously included Hollywood Casino Perryville, which was contributed to GLPI on
November 1, 2013.

The
West reportable segment consists of the following properties: Zia Park Casino and the M Resort, as well as the Jamul development project, which the Company anticipates
completing in mid-2016.

The
Southern Plains reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino Aurora, Hollywood Casino Joliet, Argosy Casino Alton, Argosy Casino Riverside, Hollywood
Casino Tunica, Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast (formerly Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis), Boomtown Biloxi, and Hollywood Casino St. Louis (formerly Harrah's St. Louis which was
acquired from Caesars Entertainment on November 2, 2012), and includes the Company's 50% investment in Kansas Entertainment, LLC ("Kansas Entertainment"), which owns the Hollywood Casino
at Kansas Speedway. On July 30, 2014, the Company closed Argosy Casino Sioux City. This segment also previously included Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge, which was contributed to GLPI on
November 1, 2013.

The
Other category consists of the Company's standalone racing operations, namely Rosecroft Raceway, Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club, and the Company's joint venture interests in Sam Houston
Race Park, Valley Race Park, and Freehold Raceway, as well as the Company's 50% joint venture with the Cordish Companies in New York. It also previously included the Company's Bullwhackers property,
which was sold in July 2013. If the Company is successful in obtaining gaming operations at these locations, they would be assigned to one of the Company's reportable segments. The Other category also
includes the Company's corporate overhead operations which does not meet the definition of an operating segment under ASC 280.

The
prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to the Company's new reporting structure in accordance with ASC 280. See Note 16 for further information with respect to the
Company's segments.

Statements of Cash Flows

The Company has presented the consolidated statements of cash flows using the indirect method, which involves the reconciliation of net
(loss) income to net cash flow from operating activities.

Acquisitions

The Company accounts for its acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations." The results of operations of
acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.

Variable Interest Entities

In accordance with the authoritative guidance of ASC 810, "Consolidation" ("ASC 810"), the Company consolidates a VIE if the Company is
the primary beneficiary, defined as the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or
the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could



potentially
be significant to the VIE. A variable interest is a contractual, ownership or other interest that changes with changes in the fair value of the VIE's net assets exclusive of variable
interests. To determine whether a variable interest the Company holds could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company considers both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature,
size and form of its involvement with the VIE. The Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE or the holder of a significant variable interest in a VIE on an on-going basis for
each such interest.

Certain Risks and Uncertainties

The Company faces intense gaming competition in most of the markets where its properties operate. Various states are currently
considering or implementing legislation to legalize or expand gaming. Such legislation presents potential opportunities for the Company to establish new properties; however, this also presents
potential competitive threats to the Company's existing properties. For example, the Company's two facilities—one in Charles Town, West Virginia and one in Grantville,
Pennsylvania—that each generated approximately 10% or more of our net revenues will face or have faced new sources of significant competition in the near term. Namely, Hollywood Casino at
Charles Town Races and, to a lesser extent, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course faced increased competition from the opening in June 2012 of a significant casino complex at the Arundel Mills
mall in Anne Arundel, Maryland. The Horseshoe Baltimore Casino, which opened at the end of August 2014, has not had a significant negative impact on the operations of these two properties, however may
have a negative impact in 2015 as the new facility becomes more established. Additionally, a mid-2016 opening of a casino operated by MGM in Prince George's County, Maryland will also negatively
impact the operations at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and, to a lesser extent, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course.

The
Company's operations are dependent on its continued licensing by state gaming commissions. The loss of a license, in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates, could have a
material adverse effect on future results of operations.

The
Company is dependent on each gaming property's local market for a significant number of its patrons and revenues. If economic conditions in these areas deteriorate or additional
gaming licenses are awarded in these markets, the Company's results of operations could be adversely affected.

The
Company is dependent on the economy of the U.S. in general, and any deterioration in the national economic, energy, credit and capital markets could have a material adverse effect on
future results of operations.

The
Company is dependent upon a stable gaming and admission tax structure in the locations that it operates in. Any change in the tax structure could have a material adverse affect on
future results of operations.

5.     New Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2014, the FASB issued guidance that amends the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of
components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. Examples of a strategic shift that has (or will have) a
major effect on an entity's operations and financial results could include a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment, or other major parts of
an entity. In addition, the amended guidance requires expanded disclosures for discontinued operations, including disclosures about a disposal of an individually significant component of an entity
that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements. The amendments are effective for all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an
entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted, but



only
for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. The Company early adopted this revised
guidance and will apply the amendments to all disposals of a component of the Company going forward.

In
May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance, which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity
should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods
or services. To achieve the core principle, the new guidance implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the
nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is prohibited. Entities can transition to the new guidance either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment
as of the date of adoption. Management is currently assessing the impact the new revenue recognition guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.

6.     Acquisitions and Other Recent Business Ventures

Jamul Indian Village

On April 5, 2013, the Company announced that, subject to final National Indian Gaming Commission approval, it and the Jamul
Indian Village of California (the "Tribe") had entered into definitive agreements to jointly develop a Hollywood Casino-branded casino on the Tribe's trust land in San Diego County, California. The
definitive agreements were entered into to: (i) secure the development, management, and branding services of the Company to assist the Tribe during the pre-development and entitlement phase of
the project; (ii) set forth the terms and conditions under which the Company will provide a loan or loans to the Tribe to fund certain development costs; and (iii) create an exclusive
arrangement between the parties.

The
Tribe is a federally recognized Indian Tribe holding a government-to-government relationship with the U.S. through the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs and
possessing certain inherent powers of self-government. The Tribe is the beneficial owner of approximately six acres of reservation land located within the exterior boundaries of the State of
California held by the U.S. in trust for the Tribe (the "Property"). The Tribe exercises jurisdiction over the Property pursuant to its powers of self-government and consistent with the resolutions
and ordinances of the Tribe. The arrangement between the Tribe and the Company provides the Tribe with the expertise, knowledge and capacity of a proven developer and operator of gaming facilities and
provides the Company with the exclusive right to administer and oversee planning, designing, development, construction management, and coordination during the development and construction of the
project as well as the management of a gaming facility on the Property.

The
proposed $360 million development project will include a three-story gaming and entertainment facility of approximately 200,000 square feet featuring over 1,700 slot machines,
43 live table games, including poker, multiple restaurants, bars and lounges and a partially enclosed parking structure with over 1,800 spaces. In mid-January 2014, the Company announced the
commencement of construction activities at the site and it is anticipated that the facility will open in mid-2016. The Company currently provides financing to the Tribe in connection with the project
and, upon opening, will manage and provide branding for the casino. The Company has a conditional loan commitment to the Tribe (that can be terminated under certain circumstances) for up to
$400 million and anticipates it will fund approximately $360 million related to this development.



The
Company is accounting for the development agreement and related loan commitment letter with the Tribe as a loan (note receivable) with accrued interest in accordance with ASC 310,
"Receivables." The loan represents advances made by the Company to the Tribe for the development and construction
of a gaming facility for the Tribe on reservation land. As such, the Tribe will own the casino and its related assets and liabilities. San Diego Gaming Ventures, LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company) is a separate legal entity established to account for the loan and, upon completion of the project and subsequent commencement of gaming operations on the Property, will be the Penn
entity which receives management and licensing fees from the Tribe. The Company has a note receivable with the Tribe for $62.0 million and $7.0 million, which includes accrued interest
of $3.3 million and $0.5 million, at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The note receivable is included in other assets within the consolidated balance sheets.
Collectability of the note receivable will be derived from the revenues of the casino operations once the project is completed. Based on the Company's current progress with this project, the Company
believes collectability of the note is highly certain. However, in the event that the Company's internal projections related to the profitability of this project and/or the timing of the opening are
inaccurate, the Company may be required to record a reserve related to the collectability of this note receivable.

The
Company considered whether the arrangement with the Tribe represents a variable interest that should be accounted for pursuant to the VIE subsections of ASC 810. The Company noted
that the scope and scope exceptions of ASC 810-10-15-12(e) states that a reporting entity shall not consolidate a government organization or financing entity established by a government organization
(other than certain financing entities established to circumvent the provisions of the VIE subsections of ASC 810). Based on the status of the Tribe as a government organization, the Company believes
its arrangement with the Tribe is not within the scope defined by ASC 810.

Plainridge Racecourse Acquisition

In September 2013, the Company entered into an option and purchase agreement to purchase Plainridge Racecourse in Massachusetts with
the sellers having no involvement in the business or operations from that date forward. The Company subsequently began to operate Plainridge Racecourse effective January 1, 2014 pursuant to a
temporary operations agreement. On February 28, 2014, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission awarded the Company a Category Two slots-only gaming license, and in early March 2014, the Company
exercised its option to purchase Plainridge Racecourse. This acquisition reflects the continuing efforts of the Company to expand its gaming operations through the development of new gaming
properties. The fixed portion of the purchase price was paid on April 11, 2014. The option and purchase agreement also contained contingent purchase price consideration that is calculated based
on the actual earnings of the gaming operations over the first ten years of operations. The first payment will be made 60 days after the completion of the first four full fiscal quarters of
operation, and every year for nine years after the first payment. The fair value of this liability was determined to be $19.2 million at December 31, 2014, based on an income approach
from the Company's internal earning projections and was discounted at a rate consistent with the risk a third party market participant would require holding the identical instrument as an asset. This
liability is included in long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. At each reporting period, the Company assesses the fair value of this obligation and changes in its value are recorded in
earnings. The amount included in interest expense related to the change in fair value of this obligation was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The preliminary purchase
price allocation resulted in an increase in land and buildings of $57.9 million and $3.0 million of goodwill.

Plainridge
Park Casino is anticipated to be a $225 million (inclusive of licensing fees) fully integrated racing and gaming facility featuring live harness racing and simulcasting
with 1,250 gaming devices, various dining and entertainment options, structured and surface parking, and a two story clubhouse with approximately 55,000 square feet. On March 14, 2014, the
Company broke ground on



the
facility, and on March 28, 2014, paid the $25 million gaming license fee associated with the facility which was recorded in other intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
The Company expects Plainridge Park Casino to open in June 2015.

Harrah's St. Louis Acquisition

On November 2, 2012, the Company closed on the agreement to acquire 100% of the equity of Harrah's St. Louis gaming and
lodging facility from Caesars Entertainment for a final purchase price of $615.2 million. While the acquisition was a stock transaction, it was treated as an asset transaction for tax purposes.
This enables the Company to amortize the goodwill and other fair value adjustments for tax purposes. The acquisition reflects the continuing efforts of the Company to expand its regional operating
platform with a facility in a large metropolitan market. At the end of 2013, the Company completed the process of transitioning the property to its Hollywood Casino-brand name. The purchase price of
the transaction was funded through an add-on to the Company's previous senior secured credit facility. The final purchase price allocation, net of cash acquired of $12.3 million, resulted in an
increase to goodwill and other intangible assets, property and equipment, net, total current assets, and total current liabilities, of $386.5 million, $225.1 million,
$0.6 million, and $9.3 million, respectively, based on their estimated fair values at November 2, 2012.

The
St. Louis facility is located adjacent to the Missouri River in Maryland Heights, Missouri, directly off I-70 and approximately 22 miles northwest of downtown
St. Louis. The facility is situated on 248 acres along the Missouri River and features 645,270 of property square footage with 2,112 slot machines, 57 table games, 21 poker tables, a 502
guestroom hotel, nine dining and entertainment venues, and structured and surface parking for approximately 4,600 spaces.

7.     Investment In and Advances to Unconsolidated Affiliates

As of December 31, 2014, investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates primarily included the Company's 50% investment in Kansas Entertainment,
which is a joint venture with International Speedway Corporation ("International Speedway"), its 50% interest in Freehold Raceway and its 50% joint venture with MAXXAM, Inc. ("MAXXAM") that
owns and operates racetracks in Texas. These investments are more fully described below.

Kansas Entertainment

Kansas Entertainment opened its Hollywood-themed facility on February 3, 2012. The facility features 244,791 of property square
footage with 2,000 slot machines, 40 table games and 12 poker tables, a 1,253 space parking structure, as well as a variety of dining and entertainment facilities. The Company and International
Speedway shared equally in the cost of developing and constructing the facility and the Company's share totaled $140.1 million, inclusive of licensing fees. As of December 31, 2014 and
2013, the Company's investment balance was $115.5 million and $127.8 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company funded $39.1 million for
capital expenditures and other operating expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company received distributions from Kansas Entertainment totaling
$23.0 million, $21.5 million and $13.0 million, respectively, which the Company deemed to be returns on its investment.

Per
the Development Agreement with the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas ("Unified Government"), Kansas Entertainment is subject to a 1.0 percent of gross
gaming revenue penalty if it had not commenced construction on an adjacent hotel by the second anniversary of its opening, which was February 2014. In June 2014, the Unified Government approved an
extension of the construction commencement date to give the Unified Government time to complete a feasibility analysis for a new convention center that could be integrated with the hotel. If the
Unified Government had formally resolved to develop a convention center to be integrated with the proposed



hotel,
then Kansas Entertainment and the Unified Government would have mutually agreed on a new groundbreaking date. However, the Unified Government decided not to proceed with the integrated
development, leaving Kansas Entertainment 100 days after the Unified Government's notification of its decision. Consequently, Kansas Entertainment has until April 10, 2015, subject to
any additional time taking into account that groundbreaking cannot realistically occur during winter conditions, to commence construction prior to the enforcement of the aforementioned penalty.

The
final decision to move forward with the proposed hotel will be market-based and subject to approval by Kansas Entertainment's Board of Directors. Should Kansas Entertainment
ultimately not build the hotel it will be subject to the penalty from the second anniversary of its opening forward. Accordingly, beginning February 2014, Kansas Entertainment began recording expense
equal to 1.0 percent of gross gaming revenue since it did not proceed with construction of a hotel by the original deadline. Included in income from unconsolidated affiliates within the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $0.6 million in expense related to this penalty.

The
Company determined that Kansas Entertainment qualified as a VIE at December 31, 2014 and 2013. The Company did not consolidate its investment in Kansas Entertainment at, and
for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, as the Company determined that it did not qualify as the primary beneficiary of Kansas Entertainment at, and for the years ended
December 31, 2014 and 2013, primarily as it did not have the ability to direct the activities of Kansas Entertainment that most significantly impacted Kansas Entertainment's economic
performance without the input of International Speedway. In addition, the Company determined that International Speedway had substantive participating rights in Kansas Entertainment at, and for the
years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.

Texas Joint Venture

On April 8, 2011, following final approval by the Texas Racing Commission, the Company completed its investment in a joint
venture with MAXXAM that owns and operates the Sam Houston Race Park in Houston, Texas and the Valley Race Park in Harlingen, Texas, and holds a license for a planned racetrack in Laredo, Texas. Under
the terms of the joint venture, the Company secured a 50% interest in the joint venture, which has sole ownership of the above facilities including interests in 168 acres at Sam Houston Race
Park, 71 acres at Valley Race Park, and an option to purchase 135 acres for the planned racetrack in Laredo, Texas.

Sam
Houston Race Park, which opened in April 1994, is located 15 miles northwest from downtown Houston along Beltway 8. Sam Houston Race Park hosts thoroughbred and quarter horse racing
and offers daily simulcast operations, as well as hosts various special events, private parties and meetings, concerts and national touring festivals throughout the year. Valley Race Park, which was
opened in 1990 and acquired by Sam Houston Race Park in 2000, features 118,216 of property square footage as a dog racing and simulcasting facility located in Harlingen, Texas.

The
Company intends to work collaboratively with MAXXAM to strengthen and enhance the existing racetrack operations as well as pursue other opportunities, including the potential for
gaming operations at the pari-mutuel facilities, to maximize the overall value of the business. As part of the agreement for the joint venture, the Company agreed to fund, upon the legalization of
gaming, a loan to the joint venture for up to $375 million to cover development costs that cannot be financed through third party debt. This loan commitment is in place through
December 31, 2015, however it may be
extended to December 31, 2016 in order to obtain gaming referendum approval in the event gaming legislation approval has occurred prior to December 31, 2015. If the joint venture elects
to utilize the loan, the rates to be paid will be LIBOR plus 800 to 900 basis points for a senior financing and an additional 500 to 600 basis points for a subordinated financing.



The
Company determined that the Texas joint venture did not qualify as a VIE at December 31, 2014 and 2013. Using the guidance for entities that are not VIEs, the Company
determined that it did not have a controlling financial interest in the joint venture at, and for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, primarily as it did not have the ability to direct
the activities of the joint venture that most significantly impacted the joint venture's economic performance without the input of MAXXAM. Therefore, the Company did not consolidate its investment in
the joint venture at, and for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.

New Jersey Joint Venture

Through its joint venture with Greenwood Limited Jersey, Inc. ("Greenwood"), the Company owns 50% of Freehold Raceway, located
in Freehold, New Jersey. The property features a half-mile standardbred race track and a 117,715 square foot grandstand.

The
Company determined that the New Jersey joint venture did not qualify as a VIE at December 31, 2014 and 2013. Using the guidance for entities that are not VIEs, the Company
determined that it did not have a controlling financial interest in the joint venture at, and for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, primarily as it did not have the ability to direct
the activities of the joint venture that most significantly impacted the joint venture's economic performance without the input of Greenwood. Therefore, the Company did not consolidate its investment
in the joint venture at, and for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.

During
the year ended December 31, 2014, total property and equipment, net increased by $271.7 million primarily due to the acquisition of Plainridge Racecourse (see
Note 6), construction costs for the development of Plainridge Park Casino, the addition of a new hotel at Zia Park Casino and the addition of two new racinos in Ohio, as well as normal
capitalized maintenance expenditures, all of which were partially offset by depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase also resulted from the relocation fees for
the two racinos in Ohio which both opened in the third quarter of 2014. In June 2013, the Company finalized the terms of its memorandum of understanding with the State of Ohio, which included an
agreement by the Company to pay a relocation fee in return for being able to relocate its existing racetracks in Toledo and Grove City to Dayton and Austintown, respectively. Upon opening, the
relocation fee for each new racino was recorded at the present value of the contractual obligation, which was calculated to be $75 million based on the 5% discount rate included in the
agreement (see Note 11 for further details on the obligation). Based on relevant authoritative accounting guidance, the Company determined that the relocation fee met the definition of a real
estate preacquisition cost and as such was capitalized.



Depreciation expense, for property and equipment as well as capital leases, totaled $167.6 million, $282.2 million, and $244.5 million in
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Interest capitalized in connection with major construction projects was $0.9 million, $1.4 million, and $8.4 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. Depreciation expense decreased by $114.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to the
contribution of real estate assets to GLPI, as well as Hollywood Casino Perryville and Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge, on November 1, 2013 (see Note 2) partially offset by the openings of
the two new racinos in Ohio in the third quarter of 2014.

During
the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $4.6 million to write-down certain idle assets to their estimated salvage value.

During
the fourth quarter of 2013, in conjunction with the relocation of the Company's two racetracks in Ohio, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $2.2 million for
the parcels of land that the racetracks resided on, as the land was reclassified as held for sale.

9.     Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Remaining goodwill consists mainly of goodwill from the acquisitions of Boomtown Biloxi in August 2000, Hollywood Casino Corporation in March 2003, Argosy Gaming
Company in October 2005, and Zia Park Casino in April 2007. A reconciliation of goodwill and accumulated goodwill impairment losses is as follows (in thousands):

Indefinite-life
intangible assets increased by $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the $100 million of gaming license fees for
Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course, as well as the $25 million gaming license fee associated with Plainridge Park Casino (see Note 6)
partially offset by impairment charges discussed below and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2014. Half of the gaming license fee for both Ohio racinos has been paid
($10 million for each facility in the second quarter of 2014 and $15 million upon opening for each facility) with the remaining $50 million ($25 million for each facility)
due one year from commencement of operations. The remaining gaming license fees to be paid are included in accrued expenses within the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014.

For
the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded pre-tax goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of $212.2 million and $104.3 million,
respectively, as it determined that a portion of the value of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired due to the Company's outlook of continued challenging regional gaming conditions at
certain properties which persisted in 2014 in its Southern Plains segment, as well as for the write-off of a trademark intangible asset in the West segment.

For
the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the Spin-Off, the Company recorded pre-tax goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of
$738.8 million and $319.6 million,
respectively, as it determined that a portion of the value of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired. The contribution of real estate to GLPI was accounted for as a contribution of
assets rather than a business. Therefore, the historical goodwill and other intangible assets of the Company (with the exception of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville since
the Company contributed them to GLPI) were not contributed to GLPI as part of the Spin-Off. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, the Company is responsible monthly for a single significant rental payment to
GLPI under the Master Lease. For impairment valuation and accounting purposes, the Company allocates the rental obligation to its reporting units that are a party to the Master Lease.

Additionally,
as a result of a new gaming license being awarded for the development of a new casino in Sioux City, Iowa to another applicant in April 2013 (see Note 12 for further
details), the Company recorded a pre-tax goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge of $68.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for Argosy Casino Sioux City during the
year ended December 31, 2013, as the Company determined that the fair value of its Sioux City reporting unit was less than its carrying amount based on the Company's analysis of the estimated
future expected cash flows the Company anticipated receiving from the operations of the Sioux City facility. Furthermore, the remaining gaming license for Argosy Casino Sioux City of
$20.9 million at time of the impairment was accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset and was amortized on a straight line basis through June 2014, the opening date of the new
facility.



In
addition, in conjunction with the Spin-Off, the Company contributed Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville, which had goodwill of $75.5 million and a
gaming license of $9.6 million, respectively, to GLPI on November 1, 2013.

The
Company's intangible asset amortization expense was $11.4 million, $16.1 million, and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively.

10.   Investment in Corporate Securities

In 2008, the Company made an investment in the corporate debt securities of another gaming company which had a maturity date of November 1, 2012. This
investment was accounted for as an available-for-sale investment and was included in other assets within the consolidated balance sheet. During 2010, the issuer of the security went into default on
its obligations as it ceased making interest payments and the security was downgraded by certain rating agencies. As a result, in 2010, the Company wrote down the investment to its fair value, which
was based on the transaction prices of the security subsequent to when the issuer defaulted on its obligations. In April 2011, the issuer of the security declared bankruptcy. In 2013, the Company
received a distribution of $6.9 million from the finalization of bankruptcy proceedings, which resulted in the recognition of a $1.5 million gain, which is included in other income
(expenses) within the consolidated statement of operations, during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Senior Secured Credit Facility

On October 30, 2013, the Company entered into a new senior secured credit facility. The new senior secured credit facility
consists of a five year $500 million revolver, a five year $500 million Term Loan A facility, and a seven year $250 million Term Loan B facility. The Term Loan A facility was
priced at LIBOR plus a spread (ranging from 2.75% to 1.25%) based on the Company's consolidated total net leverage ratio as defined in the new senior secured credit facility. The
Term Loan B facility was priced at LIBOR plus 2.50%, with a 0.75% LIBOR floor. In connection with the repayment of the previous senior secured credit facility, the Company recorded a
$21.5 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to debt issuance costs write-offs and the write-off of the discount on the Term Loan B
facility of the previous senior secured credit facility.

The
Company's senior secured credit facility had a gross outstanding balance of $807.5 million at December 31, 2014, consisting of a $475.0 million Term Loan A
facility, a $247.5 million Term Loan B facility, and $85.0 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. This compares with a $750 million gross outstanding balance at
December 31, 2013 which consisted of a $500 million Term Loan A facility and a $250 million Term Loan B facility. No balances were outstanding on the revolving credit facility at
December 31, 2013. Additionally, at December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company was contingently obligated under letters of credit issued pursuant to the senior secured credit facility with
face amounts aggregating $23.0 million and $22.1 million, respectively, resulting in $392.0 million and $477.9 million of available borrowing capacity as of
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, under the revolving credit facility.



The
payment and performance of obligations under the senior secured credit facility are guaranteed by a lien on and security interest in substantially all of the assets (other than
excluded property such as gaming licenses) of the Company and its subsidiaries.

Redemption of 8


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes

In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company redeemed all of its $325 million 8


/


% senior subordinated notes,
which were due in 2019 ("8


/


% Notes"). In connection with this redemption, the Company recorded a $40.2 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt for the year ended
December 31, 2013 related to debt issuance costs write-offs of $5.5 million and the call premium on the 8


/


% Notes of $34.7 million.

5.875% Senior Unsecured Notes

On October 30, 2013, the Company completed an offering of $300 million 5.875% senior unsecured notes that mature on
November 1, 2021 (the "5.875% Notes") at a price of par. Interest on the 5.875% Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The 5.875% Notes are senior unsecured
obligations of the Company. The 5.875% Notes will not be guaranteed by any of the Company's subsidiaries except in the event that the Company in the future issues certain subsidiary-guaranteed debt
securities. The Company may redeem the 5.875% Notes at any time, and from time to time, on or after November 1, 2016, at the declining redemption premiums set forth in the indenture governing
the 5.875% Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Prior to November 1, 2016, the Company may redeem the 5.875% Notes at any time, and from
time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 5.875% Notes redeemed plus a "make-whole" redemption premium described in the indenture governing the 5.875% Notes,
together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, the 5.875% Notes may be redeemed prior to November 1, 2016 from net proceeds raised in
connection with an equity offering as long as the Company pays 105.875% of the principal amount of the 5.875% Notes, redeems the 5.875% Notes within 180 days of completing the equity offering,
and at least 60% of the 5.875% Notes originally issued remains outstanding.

The
Company used the proceeds of the new senior secured credit facility, new 5.875% Notes, and cash on hand, to repay its previous senior secured credit facility, to fund the cash tender
offer to purchase any and all of its 8


/


% Notes and the related consent solicitation to make certain amendments to the indenture governing the 8


/


% Notes, to satisfy
and discharge such indenture, to pay related fees and expenses and for working capital purposes.

GLPI indebtedness

Immediately before the Spin-Off on October 30, 2013, while GLPI was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, GLPI raised
$2.35 billion of debt financing, which was part of the net assets contributed to GLPI as part of the Spin-Off. See Note 2 for further discussion.

Other Long-Term Obligations

Other long term obligations at December 31, 2014 of $154.2 million include $19.2 million for the contingent
purchase price consideration related to the purchase of Plainridge Racecourse (See Note 6) and $135.0 million related to the relocation fees for Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway and
Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course (see Note 8). At the time of acquisition, the fair value of the contingent purchase price consideration was determined to be $18.5 million
based on an income approach from the Company's internal earning projections and was discounted at a rate consistent with the risk a third party market participant would require holding the identical
instrument as an asset. At each reporting period, the Company assesses the fair value of this obligation and



changes
in its value are recorded in earnings. The amount included in interest expense related to the accretion of this obligation was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
The relocation fee for each facility is payable as follows: $7.5 million upon the opening of the facility and eighteen semi-annual payments of $4.8 million beginning one year from the
commencement of operations. This obligation was measured at its present value and is accreted to interest expense at an effective yield of 5.0%. The amount included in interest expense related to this
obligation was $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

In
September 2012, the Company received $10 million under a subscription agreement entered into between A3 Gaming Investments, LLC, an investment vehicle owned by the
previous owner of the M Resort ("A3 Gaming Investments"), and LV Gaming Ventures, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and holder of the assets of the M Resort ("LV Gaming Ventures").
The subscription agreement entitled A3 Gaming Investments to invest in a limited liability membership interest in LV Gaming Ventures, which was scheduled to mature on October 1, 2016.
The investment entitled A3 Gaming Investments to annual payments and a settlement value based on the earnings levels of the M Resort. In accordance with ASC 480, "Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity," the Company determined that this obligation was a financial instrument and as such should be recorded as a liability within debt. Changes in the settlement value, if any,
were accreted to interest expense through the maturity date of the instrument. In September 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to terminate the subscription agreement, which was repaid on
October 22, 2013 for $16 million. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded a charge of $3.8 million, and $2.2 million in interest expense on
this instrument.

Covenants

The Company's senior secured credit facility and 5.875% Notes require us, among other obligations, to maintain specified financial
ratios and to satisfy certain financial tests, including fixed charge coverage, interest coverage, senior leverage and total leverage ratios. In addition, the Company's senior secured credit facility
and 5.875% Notes restrict, among other things, its ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur guarantee obligations, amend debt instruments, pay dividends, create liens on assets, make
investments, engage in mergers or consolidations, and otherwise restrict corporate activities.

At
December 31, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all required financial covenants.

12.   Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

The Company is subject to various legal and administrative proceedings relating to personal injuries, employment matters, commercial
transactions and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations. In addition, the Company maintains what it believes is adequate insurance coverage to further mitigate the risks of such proceedings. However,
such proceedings can be costly, time consuming and unpredictable and, therefore, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of such proceedings may not materially impact the Company's
consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Further, no assurance can be given that the amount or scope of existing insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover losses arising from
such matters.

The
following proceedings could result in costs, settlements, damages, or rulings that materially impact the Company's consolidated financial condition or operating results. The Company
believes that it has meritorious defenses, claims and/or counter-claims with respect to these proceedings, and intends to vigorously defend itself or pursue its claims.



Gaming licenses in Iowa are typically issued jointly to a gaming operator and a local charitable organization known as a QSO. The agreement between the Company's
gaming operator subsidiary in Iowa, Belle of Sioux City, L.P. ("Belle"), and its QSO, Missouri River Historical Development, Inc. ("MRHD"), expired in early July 2012. On July 12,
2012, when presented with an extension of the Company's QSO/operating agreement for the Sioux City facility through March 2015, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission ("IRGC") refused to approve the
extension. On April 18, 2013, the IRGC awarded the license to another gaming operator. In August 2013, the IRGC formally denied the Company's application for a renewal of its state license. The
Belle filed numerous petitions challenging the IRGC's actions which have all been denied by the Iowa District Court in Polk County, Iowa. The Belle has filed a consolidated appeal which is pending
before the Iowa Supreme Court. On July 30, 2014, Argosy Casino Sioux City ceased its operations.

On
October 21, 2011, the Ohio Roundtable filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas in Franklin County, Ohio against a number of defendants, including the Governor, the Ohio
Lottery Commission and the Ohio Casino Control Commission. The complaint alleges a variety of substantive and procedural defects relative to the approval and implementation of video lottery terminals
as well as several counts dealing with the taxation of standalone casinos. As intervenors, we, along with the other two casinos in Ohio, filed motions for judgment on the pleadings to supplement the
position of the Racing Commission. In May 2012, the complaint was dismissed, and in March 2013, the Ohio appeals court upheld the dismissal. On April 30, 2013, plaintiffs requested the Ohio
Supreme Court to hear an appeal of the decision, and the Ohio Supreme Court elected to accept the appeal. The appeal is currently pending.

Operating Lease Commitments

As of November 1, 2013, the Company entered into the Master Lease with GLPI in connection with the Spin-Off. The rent structure
under the Master Lease includes a fixed component, a portion of which is subject to an annual escalator of up to 2% if certain rent coverage ratio thresholds are met, and a component that is based on
the performance of the facilities, which is prospectively adjusted, subject to a floor of zero (i) every five years by an amount equal to 4% of the average change to net revenues of all
facilities under the Master Lease (other than Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo) during the preceding five years, and (ii) monthly by an amount equal to 20% of the change in
net revenues of Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo during the preceding month. In addition, with the openings of Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning
Valley Race Course in the third quarter of 2014, these properties began paying rent subject to the terms of the Master Lease, which had the impact of increasing the Company's annual rental expense
related to the Master Lease by approximately $19 million, which approximates ten percent of the real estate construction costs paid for by GLPI related to these facilities.

The
Master Lease is commonly known as a triple-net lease. Accordingly, in addition to rent, the Company is required to pay the following, among other things: (1) all facility
maintenance; (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased
properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); and (4) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased
properties. Total rental expense under the Master Lease was $421.4 million and $69.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

At
the Company's option, the Master Lease may be extended for up to four five-year renewal terms beyond the initial fifteen-year term, on the same terms and conditions. If the Company
elects to renew the term of the Master Lease, the renewal will be effective as to all, but not less than all, of the leased property then subject to the Master Lease, provided that the final renewal
option shall only be exercisable with respect to certain of the barge-based facilities—i.e., facilities where barges serve as



foundations
upon which buildings are constructed to serve as gaming or related facilities or serve ancillary purposes such as access platforms or shear barges to protect a gaming facility from
floating debris—following an independent third party expert's review of the total useful life of the applicable barged-based facility measured from the beginning of the initial term. If
the final five-year
renewal term would not cause the aggregate term to exceed 80% of the useful life of such facility, the facility shall be included in the five-year renewal. In the event that a five-year renewal of
such facility would cause it to exceed 80% of the estimated useful life, such facility shall be included in the renewal for the period of time equal to but not exceeding 80% of the estimated useful
life.

In
April 2014, an amendment to the Master Lease was entered into in order to revise certain provisions relating to the Company's Sioux City property. In accordance with the amendment,
upon the ceasing of gaming operations at Argosy Casino Sioux City on July 30, 2014 due to the termination of its gaming license, the annual rent payable to GLPI was reduced by
$6.2 million. Additionally, the Company finalized its calculation of rent coverage in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Master Lease to determine if an annual base rent
escalator is due. The calculation of the escalator resulted in an increase to the Company's annual rent expense of $3.2 million starting November 1, 2014.

The
Company does not have the ability to terminate its obligations under the Master Lease prior to its expiration without GLPI's consent. If the Master Lease is terminated prior to its
expiration other than with GLPI's consent, the Company may be liable for damages and incur charges such as continued payment of rent through the end of the lease term and maintenance costs for the
leased property.

Additionally,
the Company is liable under numerous operating leases for various assets, including but not limited to an airplane, automobiles, and other equipment. Total rental expense
under these other lease agreements was $34.0 million, $37.1 million, and $38.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The
future minimum lease commitments relating to the base lease rent portion of noncancelable operating leases, separated by the Master Lease and other lease commitments, at
December 31, 2014 are as follows (in thousands):

Capital Expenditure Commitments

The Company's current construction program for 2015 calls for capital expenditures of approximately $121.9 million, of which the
Company was contractually committed to spend approximately $18.3 million at December 31, 2014.

Purchase obligations

The Company has obligations to purchase various goods and services totaling $44.4 million at December 31, 2014, of which
$33.6 million will be incurred in 2015.



Employee Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a qualified retirement plan under the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, which covers all eligible employees. The plan enables participating employees to defer a portion of their salary in a retirement fund to be administered by the Company. The Company makes a
discretionary match contribution, where applicable, of 50% of employees' elective salary deferrals, up to a maximum of 6% of eligible employee compensation. The matching contributions for the
qualified retirement plan for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $4.7 million, $4.6 million, and $3.7 million, respectively.

The
Company also has a defined contribution plan, the Charles Town Races Future Service Retirement Plan, covering substantially all of its union employees at Hollywood Casino at Charles
Town Races. Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races makes annual contributions to this plan for the eligible union employees and to the Penn National Gaming, Inc. 401(k) Plan for the eligible
non-union employees for an amount equal to the amount accrued for retirement expense, which is calculated as 0.25% of the daily mutual handle, 1.0% of net video lottery revenue up to a base and, after
the base is met, it reverts to 0.5% and 0.84% of table and poker revenue, respectively. The contributions for the two plans at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races for the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $3.0 million, $3.6 million, and $3.9 million, respectively.

The
Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that covers most management and other highly-compensated employees. This plan was effective March 1, 2001. The
plan allows the participants to defer, on a pre-tax basis, a portion of their base annual salary and/or their annual bonus, and earn tax-deferred earnings on these deferrals. The plan also provides
for matching Company contributions that vest over a five-year period. The Company has established a Trust, and transfers to the Trust, on a periodic basis, an amount necessary to provide for its
respective future
liabilities with respect to participant deferral and Company contribution amounts. The Company's matching contributions for the non-qualified deferred compensation plan for the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $1.9 million, $2.3 million, and $2.7 million, respectively. The Company's deferred compensation liability, which was included in other
current liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets, was $61.4 million and $53.7 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Labor Agreements

The Company is required to have agreements with the horsemen at the majority of its racetracks to conduct its live racing and/or
simulcasting activities. In addition, in order to operate gaming machines and table games in West Virginia, the Company must maintain agreements with each of the Charles Town horsemen, pari-mutuel
clerks and breeders.

At
Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, the Company has an agreement with the Charles Town Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association that expired on December 31, 2013
and has been extended on a month-to-month basis while negotiations are in progress. Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races also has an agreement with the breeders that expires on June 30, 2015.
Additionally, the pari-mutuel clerks at Charles Town are represented under a collective bargaining agreement with the West Virginia Union of Mutuel Clerks, which expired on December 31, 2010
and has been extended on a month-to-month basis while negotiations are in process.

The
Company's agreement with the Pennsylvania Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course expires on January 31, 2016. The
Company had a collective bargaining agreement with Local 137 of the Sports Arena Employees at Penn National Race Course with respect to on-track pari-mutuel clerks and admissions personnel which
expired on December 31, 2011. In August 2012, Local 137 of the Sports Arena Employees announced that they entered into a "voluntary supervision" agreement with their international union,
Laborers'



International
Union of North America ("LIUNA") Local 108. In February 2014, a new agreement with LIUNA Local 108 for on-track and OTWs bargaining units was ratified for three years.

The
Company's agreement with the Maine Harness Horsemen Association at Bangor Raceway continues through the conclusion of the 2015 racing season.

In
March of 2014, Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course entered into an agreement with the Ohio Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association. The term is for a period of
ten years from the September 2014 commencement of video lottery terminal operations at that facility.

The
Company's agreement with the Ohio Harness Horsemen's Association for racing at Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway expired on December 31, 2014 but is still in effect pending
the ongoing negotiations of a successor agreement.

Rosecroft
Raceway entered into agreements with the Cloverleaf Standardbred Owners Association ("CSOA") and Maryland Standardbred Breeder's Association ("MSBA") as of July 5, 2011.
CSOA's agreement has been extended through December 31, 2020 with certain termination provisions. The MSBA agreement has been extended through December 31, 2020. Additionally, Rosecroft
Raceway has entered into agreements with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union ("UFCW") Local 27 and the Seafarers Entertainment and Allied Trade Union ("SEATU") for certain bargaining
positions at the racetrack. The UFCW Local 27 agreement was ratified on December 13, 2014 and expires on November 30, 2019. The SEATU agreement expires on November 30, 2020.

Across
certain of the Company's properties, SEATU represents approximately 1,280 of the Company's employees under agreements that expire at various times between November 2015 and
May 2022. At Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg and Argosy Casino Riverside, the SEATU agreements expired in June 2014 and October 2013, respectively, and both have been extended on a monthly basis
while negotiations are in process. At Hollywood Casino Joliet, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union Local 1 represents approximately 191 employees under a collective bargaining agreement
which expires on March 31, 2015. At Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo, a council comprised of the United Auto Workers and the United Steel Workers represents approximately
1,321 employees under a collective bargaining agreement which ends on November 15, 2019. In addition, at some of the Company's properties, the Security Police and Fire Professionals of America,
the International Brotherhood of Electronic Workers Locals 176 and 649, the LIUNA Public Serviced Employees Local 1290PE, and the United Industrial, Service, Transportation, Professional and
Government Workers of North America represent certain of the Company's employees under collective bargaining agreements that expire at various times between June 2015 and September 2025. None of these
additional unions represent more than 85 of the Company's employees.

If
the Company fails to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at a track, it will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting at that track and
OTWs and, in West Virginia, the Company will not be permitted to operate its gaming machines and table games unless the state intervenes or changes the statute. In addition, the Company's simulcasting
agreements are subject to the horsemen's approval. If the Company fails to renew or modify existing agreements on satisfactory terms, this failure could have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition and results of operations. Except for the closure of the facilities at Penn National Race Course and its OTWs from February 16, 1999 to March 24, 1999 due to a
horsemen's strike, and a few days at other
times and locations, the Company has been able to maintain the necessary agreements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain the required agreements.

13.   Income Taxes

The following table summarizes the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their
respective tax basis, which are recorded at



the
prevailing enacted tax rate that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The Company
has concluded with a more-likely-than-not level of assurance that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize in totality the deferred tax assets, net of
valuation allowances. The Company's conclusion was based on consideration of taxable income before taxes generated in 2012 through 2014, as well as, future reversals of existing deductible temporary
differences and projections of future income before taxes.

The

The
realizability of the net deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the need for a valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance, if necessary. The
Company gives appropriate consideration to all available positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to
realize the net deferred tax assets. The evaluation of both positive and negative evidence is a requirement pursuant to ASC 740 in determining the net deferred tax assets will be realized. In the
event the Company determines that the deferred income tax assets would be realized in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded,
which would reduce the provision for income taxes.

For
income tax reporting, the Company has gross state net operating loss carry-forwards aggregating approximately $184.6 million available to reduce future state income taxes,
primarily for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the States of Missouri, New Mexico and Ohio as of December 31, 2014. The tax benefit associated with these net operating loss carry-forwards
is approximately $9.6 million. Due to statutorily limited operating loss carry-forwards and income and loss projections in the applicable jurisdictions, a $4.5 million valuation
allowance has been recorded to reflect the net



operating
losses which are not presently expected to be realized. If not used, substantially all the carry-forwards will expire at various dates from December 31, 2015 to December 31,
2034.

Additionally,
the Company has a valuation allowance in the amount of $2.4 million for federal capital losses that will expire if not used via the realization of capital gains by
December 31, 2033. Overall the Company's valuation allowance at December 31, 2014 increased from December 31, 2013 by a net amount of $3.2 million primarily due to the
duration of statutorily limited operating loss carry-forward periods.

In
addition, certain subsidiaries have accumulated gross state net operating loss carry-forwards aggregating approximately $916.6 million for which no benefit has been recorded as
they are attributable to uncertain tax positions. The unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2014 attributable to these net operating losses was approximately $55.7 million. Due to
the uncertain tax position, these net operating losses are not included as components of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014. In the event of any benefit from realization of these net
operating losses, $11.5 million would be treated as an increase to equity, and the remainder would be treated as a reduction of tax expense. If not used, substantially all the carry-forwards
will expire at various dates from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2034.

As
discussed in Note 9, in the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company incurred pre-tax goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $316.5 million and incurred
significant impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to the Spin-Off. This caused the Company to be in a cumulative three year pre-tax loss position. The Company considered this cumulative
loss for book purposes and concluded that its deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance were more-likely-than-not to be realizable due to the fact that these non-tax deductible impairment
charges are not anticipated to impact future earning levels to a point that would call into question the realizability of the Company's deferred tax assets.

The
provision for income taxes charged to operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was as follows:

The
Company is required under ASC 740 to disclose its accounting policy for classifying interest and penalties, the amount of interest and penalties charged to expense each period, as
well as the cumulative amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company will continue to classify any income tax-related penalties and interest accrued related to unrecognized tax
benefits in taxes on income within the consolidated statements of operations.

During
the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded $6.0 million of tax reserves and accrued interest related to current year uncertain tax positions. In regards
to prior year tax positions, the Company recorded $5.2 million of tax reserves and accrued interest and reversed $8.0 million and



$0.4 million
of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest, respectively, for uncertain tax positions that have settled and/or closed. Overall, the Company recorded a net tax expense
of $2.3 million in connection with its uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Included
in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $11.5 million and $21.3 million, respectively, of tax positions that, if
reversed, would affect the effective tax rate.

Included
in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $2.5 million and $1.8 million of currency translation gains for foreign
currency tax positions, respectively.

During
the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized approximately $1.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of interest and penalties, net
of deferred taxes. In addition, due to settlements and/or reductions in previously recorded liabilities, the Company had reductions in previously accrued interest and penalties of $0.3 million,
net of deferred taxes. These accruals are included in noncurrent tax liabilities and prepaid expenses within the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The
Company is currently in various stages of the examination process in connection with its open audits. Generally, it is difficult to determine when these examinations will be closed,
but the Company reasonably expects that its ASC 740 liabilities will not significantly change over the next twelve months.

As
of December 31, 2014, the Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for the tax years 2011, 2012, and 2013. In addition, the Company is subject to state and
local income tax examinations for various tax years in the taxing jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

At
December 31, 2014 and 2013, prepaid expenses within the consolidated balance sheets included prepaid income taxes of $32.3 million and $39.4 million,
respectively.

14.   Shareholders' Equity

Preferred Equity Investment

On June 15, 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into a merger agreement that, at the effective time of the
transactions contemplated thereby, would have resulted in the Company's shareholders receiving $67.00 per share. Specifically, the Company, PNG Acquisition Company Inc. ("Parent") and PNG
Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), announced that they had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 15, 2007 (the "Merger
Agreement"), that provided, among other things, for Merger Sub to be merged with and into the Company, as a result of which the Company would have continued as the surviving corporation and would have
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent is indirectly owned by certain funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group LLC ("Fortress") and Centerbridge
Partners, L.P. ("Centerbridge").

On
July 3, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with certain affiliates of Fortress and Centerbridge, terminating the Merger Agreement. In connection with the termination
of the Merger Agreement, the Company agreed to receive a total of $1.475 billion, consisting of a nonrefundable $225 million cash termination fee and a $1.25 billion, zero coupon,
preferred equity investment (the "Investment"). On October 30, 2008, the Company closed the sale of the Investment and issued 12,500 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock. During the
year ended December 31, 2010, the Company repurchased 225 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for $11.2 million.

As
part of the Spin-Off described further in Note 2, the Company entered into an agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with FIF V PFD LLC, an affiliate of Fortress,
providing for the exchange of



shares
of the Company's Series B Preferred Stock for shares of a new class of preferred stock, Series C Preferred Stock, in contemplation of the Spin-Off.

The
Exchange Agreement provided Fortress with the right to exchange its 9,750 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for fractional shares of Series C Preferred Stock at an
exchange ratio that treated each such fractional share (and therefore each share of common stock into which such fractional share was convertible) as worth $67 per share, which was the "ceiling price"
at which the shares of Series B Preferred Stock were redeemable by the Company at maturity. Any shares of Series B Preferred Stock that were not exchanged for shares of Series C
Preferred Stock prior to the second business day before October 16, 2013, the record date established for the distribution of GLPI common stock in the Spin-Off, was automatically exchanged for
shares of Series C Preferred Stock on such date. Subsequently, the Company had the right to purchase from Fortress, prior to the record date for the Spin-Off, a number of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock, at a price of $67 per fractional share of Series C Preferred Stock, such that, immediately following the consummation of the Spin-Off, Fortress would not own
more than 9.9% of GLPI's common stock.

On
October 11, 2013, the Company completed its exchange and repurchase transactions with Fortress and repurchased all of the 2,300 shares of Series B Preferred Stock held
by Centerbridge at par. Additionally, in February 2013, the Company repurchased 225 shares of Series B Preferred Stock from WF Investment Holdings, LLC at a slight discount to par. In
these transactions, the Company paid a total of $649.5 million, which was primarily funded by borrowings under the revolving credit facility, to the affiliates of Fortress, Centerbridge and WF
Investment Holdings, LLC, and issued to the affiliate of Fortress 8,624 shares of non-voting Series C Preferred Stock in order to redeem all of the previously outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred Stock. As a result of these transactions, there are currently no outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Fortress holds 8,624 shares of Series C
Preferred Stock.

Under
the terms of the Statement with Respect to Shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the "Series C Designation"), the Series C Preferred
Stock is nonvoting stock, provided, however, that the Series C Designation cannot be altered or amended so as to adversely affect any right or privilege held by the holders of Series C
shares without the consent of a majority of the shares of Series C then outstanding. Holders of Series C shares will participate in dividends paid to the holders of common stock of the
Company on an as-converted basis. Each share of Series C will automatically convert into 1,000 shares of common stock upon sale to a third party not affiliated with the original holder.

The
following table below discloses the changes in each class of the Company's preferred stock for the year ended December 31, 2013. No changes in the Company's preferred stock
occurred in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2012.

15.   Stock-Based Compensation

On April 16, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors adopted and approved the 2003 Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2003 Plan"). On
May 22, 2003, the Company's shareholders approved the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan was effective June 1, 2003 and permitted the grant of options to purchase common stock and other
market-based and performance-based awards. Up to 12,000,000 shares of common stock were available for awards under the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan provided for the granting of both incentive stock
options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and nonqualified stock options, which do not so qualify. The exercise price per share may be no
less than (i) 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date an option is granted for incentive stock options and (ii) 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on
the date an option is granted for nonqualified stock options. However the shares which remained available for issuance under such plan as of November 12, 2008 are no longer available for
issuance and all future equity awards will be pursuant to the 2008 Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2008 Plan") described below.

On
August 20, 2008, the Company's Board of Directors adopted and approved the 2008 Plan. On November 12, 2008, the Company's shareholders approved the 2008 Plan. The 2008
Plan permits the
Company to issue stock options (incentive and/or non-qualified), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, phantom stock units and other equity and cash awards to employees. Non- employee directors
are eligible to receive all such awards, other than incentive stock options. On June 9, 2011, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the 2008 Plan to increase the aggregate number
of shares of common stock that may be issued by 2,350,000 to 9,250,000. Awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights will be counted against the 9,250,000 limit as one share of common stock
for each share granted. However, each share awarded in the form of restricted stock, or any other full value stock award, will be counted as issuing 2.44 shares of common stock for purposes of
determining the number of shares available for issuance under the plan. Any awards that are not settled in shares of common stock shall not count against this limit. At December 31, 2014, there
were 7,262,415 options available for future grants under the 2008 Plan.

In
connection with the Spin-Off of GLPI, the Company's employee stock options and cash-settled stock appreciation rights ("SARs") were converted into two awards, an award in Penn with an
adjusted exercise price and an award in GLPI. The number of options and SARs and the exercise price of each converted award were adjusted to preserve the same intrinsic value of the awards that
existed immediately prior to the Spin-Off. As such, no incremental compensation expense was recorded as a result of this conversion. In addition, holders of outstanding restricted stock awards and
cash-settled phantom stock unit awards ("PSUs") received an additional share of restricted stock or PSUs in GLPI common stock at the Spin-Off so that the intrinsic value of these awards were
equivalent to those that existed immediately prior to the Spin-Off. The unrecognized compensation costs associated with GLPI restricted stock awards, GLPI PSUs, GLPI stock options and GLPI SARs held
by Penn employees will continue to be recognized on the Company's financial statements over the awards remaining vesting periods.

The
unrecognized compensation costs associated with GLPI restricted stock awards, GLPI PSUs, GLPI stock options and GLPI SARs held by former Penn employees (including but not limited to
the Company's former Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Senior Vice President of Corporate Development) who are now employed by GLPI effective November 1, 2013, will be
recorded on GLPI's financial statements.

Stock
options that expire between April 18, 2015 and February 24, 2021, have been granted to officers, directors, employees, and predecessor employees to purchase common
stock at prices ranging from $4.39 to $14.41 per share. All options were granted at the fair market value of the common stock on the date the options were granted and have contractual lives ranging
from 5 to 10 years. The Company issues new authorized common shares to satisfy stock option exercises as well as restricted stock lapses.

Stock-based
compensation expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $10.7 million, $22.8 million and $28.6 million, respectively,
and are included within the consolidated statements of operations under general and administrative expense. The decrease for the year ended



December 31,
2014, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, is primarily due to the fact that certain members of Penn's executive management team transferred their employment
to GLPI following the Spin-Off as well as lower aggregate executive compensation following the Spin-Off.

At
December 31, 2014 and 2013, the total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized equaled $10.9 million and $20.0 million, respectively,
including $7.3 million and $13.2 million for stock options, respectively, and $3.6 million and $6.8 million for restricted stock, respectively. This cost is expected to be
recognized over the remaining vesting periods, which will not exceed five years.

The
Company's PSUs, which vest over a period of three to five years, entitle employees and directors to receive cash based on the fair value of the Company's common stock on the vesting
date. The PSUs are accounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period until they become vested with compensation expense being recognized over the requisite
service period in accordance with ASC 718-30, "Compensation—Stock Compensation, Awards Classified as Liabilities." The Company has a liability, which is included in accrued salaries and
wages within the consolidated balance sheets, associated with its PSUs of $8.2 million and $6.8 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

For
PSUs held by Penn employees, there was $25.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost at December 31, 2014 that will be recognized over the grants remaining
weighted average vesting period of 2.42 years. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized $8.3 million, $11.9 million, and
$5.9 million of compensation expense associated with these awards, respectively. Amounts paid by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 on these cash-settled
awards totaled $6.9 million, $6.6 million, and $2.6 million, respectively.

For
the Company's SARs, the fair value of the SARs is calculated during each reporting period and estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the various inputs
discussed in Note 4. The Company's SARs, which vest over a period of four years, are accounted for as liability awards since they will be settled in cash. The Company has a liability, which is
included in accrued salaries and wages within the consolidated balance sheets, associated with its SARs of $6.3 million and $11.4 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.

For
SARs held by Penn employees, there was $5.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost at December 31, 2014 that will be recognized over the awards remaining
weighted average vesting period of 2.82 years. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized a $2.9 million compensation benefit associated with these awards. For
the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized $7.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of compensation expense associated with these awards. The reason
for these declines was due to a drop in the stock prices of GLPI and Penn common stock during 2014. Amounts paid by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 on these
cash-settled awards totaled $2.2 million, $1.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

During
the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company recorded pre-tax goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of $316.5 million ($253.5 million, net of taxes), as
it determined that a portion of the value of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired due to the Company's outlook of continued challenging regional gaming conditions which persisted in
2014 at certain properties in its Southern Plains segment, as well as for the write-off of a trademark intangible asset in the West segment. During the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded a
pre-tax impairment charge of $4.6 million ($2.8 million, net of taxes) to write-down certain idle assets to their estimated salvage value.

During
the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2014, the Company paid rental expense related to the Master Lease, which became effective November 1, 2013, of
$104.3 million, $104.6 million, $104.6 million and $107.8 million, respectively.

During
the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily as a result of the Spin-Off, the Company recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $1,058.4 million ($842.9 million, net of
taxes), as it determined that a portion of the value of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired. In addition, in conjunction with the relocation of the Company's two racetracks in Ohio,
the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $2.2 million ($1.4 million, net of taxes) during the fourth quarter of 2013 for the parcels of land that the racetracks resided on, as
the land was reclassified as held for sale. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2013, as a result of a new gaming license being awarded for the development of a new casino in Sioux City, Iowa
to another applicant in April 2013, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $71.8 million ($70.5 million, net of taxes) for Argosy Casino Sioux City, as the Company
determined that the fair value of its Sioux City reporting unit was less than its carrying amount based on the Company's analysis of the estimated future expected cash flows the Company anticipated
receiving from the operations of the Sioux City facility.

Results
for the fourth quarter of 2013 only include results for one month for Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville as they were contributed to GLPI on
November 1, 2013. The Company paid rental expense related to the Master Lease of $69.5 million during this time period.



During
the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2013, the Company incurred transaction costs of $2.3 million, $3.5 million, $8.9 million and
$14.1 million, respectively, associated with the Spin-Off.

During
the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $61.7 million in connection with the repayments of its previous indebtedness.

18.   Related Party Transactions

The Company currently leases executive office and warehouse space for buildings in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania from affiliates of its Chairman of the Board of
Directors. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 amounted to $1.1 million, $1.1 million, and $1.0 million, respectively. The leases for the
office space all expire in May 2019, and the lease for the warehouse space is on a month-to-month basis. The future minimum lease commitments relating to these leases at December 31, 2014 are
$5.2 million.

19.   Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the
various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach, and cost approach). The levels of the hierarchy are described below:

•

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these
include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market
activity.

The
Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their
placement within the fair value hierarchy.

The
following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate:

Cash and cash equivalents

The fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents,
due to the short maturity of the cash equivalents.

Long-term debt

The fair value of the Company's Term Loan A and B components of its senior secured credit facility and senior unsecured notes is
estimated based on quoted prices in active markets and as such is a Level 1 measurement. The fair value of the remainder of the Company's senior secured credit facility approximates its
carrying value as it is revolving, variable rate debt and as such is a Level 2 measurement (No balances were outstanding on the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2013). The fair
value of the Company's contingent purchase price consideration related to its Plainridge Racecourse acquisition, which is classified in other long-term obligations, is estimated based on a discounted
cash flow model (See Note 11) and as such is a Level 3 measurement. At each reporting period, the Company assesses the fair value of this obligation and changes in its value are recorded
in earnings. The amount included in interest expense related to the change in fair value of this obligation was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The fair value of the

Goodwill and intangible assets

The valuation technique used to measure the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets was the income approach. See Note 4 for
a description of the inputs and the information used to develop the inputs in calculating the fair value measurements of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets.

For
the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded pre-tax goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of $212.2 million and $104.3 million,
respectively, as it determined that a portion of the value of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired due to the Company's outlook of continued challenging regional gaming conditions at
certain properties which persisted in 2014 in its Southern Plains segment, as well as for the write-off of a trademark intangible asset in the West segment.

For
the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result the Spin-Off, the Company recorded pre-tax goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of
$738.8 million and $319.6 million, respectively, as it determined that a portion of the value of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired. Additionally, as a result of a new
gaming license being awarded for the development of a new casino in Sioux City, Iowa to another applicant in April 2013 (see Note 12 for further details), the Company recorded a pre-tax
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge of $68.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for Argosy Casino Sioux City during the year ended December 31, 2013, as the
Company determined that the fair value of its Sioux City reporting unit was less than its carrying amount based on the Company's analysis of the estimated future expected cash flows the Company
anticipated receiving from the operations of the Sioux City facility.

Long-lived assets

The valuation technique used to measure the fair value of long-lived assets was the market approach. See Note 4 for a
description of the inputs and the information used to develop the inputs in calculating the fair value measurements of long-lived assets.

During
the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $4.6 million to write-down certain idle assets to their estimated salvage value of
$0.3 million.

For
the year ended December 31, 2013, in conjunction with the relocation of the Company's two racetracks in Ohio, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of
$2.2 million for the parcels of land that the racetracks resided on, as the land was reclassified as held for sale. The fair value of the land was based on the expected proceeds to be received
by the Company upon completion of the sale.



20.   Insurance Recoveries and Deductibles

Hollywood Casino St. Louis Tornado

On May 31, 2013, Hollywood Casino St. Louis sustained damage as a result of a tornado and was forced to close for
approximately fourteen hours. At the time of the tornado, the Company carried property insurance coverage with a limit of $600 million for both property damage and business interruption
applicable to this event. This coverage included a $2.5 million property damage deductible and two days of business interruption deductible for the peril of a tornado.

The
Company received $8.7 million in insurance proceeds related to the tornado at Hollywood Casino St. Louis, with $5.7 million received in 2014 and
$3.0 million received in 2013. As the insurance recovery amount exceeded the net book value of assets believed to be damaged or destroyed and other costs incurred as a result of the tornado at
Hollywood Casino St. Louis in 2013, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. During the third quarter of 2014, the insurance
claim for the tornado at Hollywood Casino St. Louis was settled and no further proceeds will be received.

During
the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded a $2.5 million pre-tax loss for the property damage insurance deductible, which was partially offset by a
$2.4 million pre-tax gain recorded for proceeds received that exceeded the net book value of assets believed to be damaged or destroyed and other costs incurred as a result of the tornado at
Hollywood Casino St. Louis.

Hollywood Casino Tunica Flood

On May 1, 2011, Hollywood Casino Tunica was forced to close as a result of flooding by the Mississippi River. Due to the
flooding, access to the property was temporarily cut off and the property sustained minor damage. The property reopened on May 25, 2011.

At
the time of the flood, the Company carried property insurance coverage with a flood limit of $300 million for both property damage and business interruption applicable to this
event. This coverage included a $5 million property damage and two day business interruption deductible for the peril of flood.

The
Company received $15.4 million in insurance proceeds related to the flood at Hollywood Casino Tunica, with $8.4 million received during the year ended
December 31, 2012. As the insurance recovery amount exceeded the net book value of assets believed to be damaged and other costs incurred as a result of the flood in 2012, the Company recorded
a pre-tax gain of $7.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2012. During the second quarter of 2012, the insurance claim for the flood at Hollywood Casino Tunica was settled and as
such no further proceeds will be received.



ITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company's management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of December 31, 2014, which is the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and
management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2014 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in
reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f)) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a- 15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and concluded that it was effective as of December 31, 2014. In making this assessment,
we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013
framework)

.

Ernst &
Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting which immediately follows this report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board
of Directors

Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries

We
have audited Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Penn National Gaming, Inc. and
Subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2014, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Penn National
Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in shareholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 and our report dated February 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
