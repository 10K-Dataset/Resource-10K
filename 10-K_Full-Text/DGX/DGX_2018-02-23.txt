OUR STRATEGY AND STRENGTHS

In 2012, Quest Diagnostics launched a new vision, goals and strategy.

Our Strategy

In November 2012, we introduced a five-point business strategy to achieve our vision and our goals.  We executed on this strategy, and at our Investor Day in November 2016, we updated our strategy to reflect our progress, narrowing our focus to two elements.  Our Board of Directors has reviewed our strategy.

1. Accelerate growth.

Our strategy to accelerate revenue growth is based on a new way of looking at the Company’s portfolio of services.  The Company's portfolio, from the perspective of growth, can be looked at as discussed in the following table.



The Company has identified five strategies to accelerate growth.  They are set forth in the following table and discussed further below.

The Company also plans to pursue strategic relationships to help accelerate growth.  We believe that strategic relationships, including with healthcare providers, public health authorities, consumer-focused entities and others, can position us for growth at the center of healthcare and that healthcare companies that can partner effectively with others will be successful in the long term.  The Company has maintained strategic partnerships over the years, and in recent years has pursued additional collaborations with leading partners.  In 2017, the Company forged several new strategic relationships, including with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Cleveland Clinic, McKesson Specialty Health, U.S. Oncology Network and Texas Oncology.  The Company's collaborations are discussed more fully below, in connection with table 14.

Growth through acquisitions

.

The Company has maintained a strategy, unchanged since November 2012, to grow 1-2% per year through accretive, strategic acquisitions.  The Company's approach to acquisitions is discussed below on page 8, under the heading

Deliver disciplined capital deployment

.

Partner with health plans, independent delivery networks and other risk bearing entities

.

To help accelerate growth, we are focusing significant resources on large opportunities to partner with outside entities.  We are deepening our relationships with health plans.  This includes building an information platform to help health plans manage utilization and population health, and enhancing processes to help plans keep laboratory testing in network.  We also are seeking to more effectively partner with IDNs, on their laboratory testing strategy.  We have deployed a dedicated health systems team to strengthen our



relationships with IDNs, including with respect to their reference testing.  We provide reference testing for approximately 50% of hospitals in the U.S., and are the leading provider of this testing in the country.

We have developed a full suite of solutions, our Professional Laboratory Services offerings, to help IDNs build and execute their laboratory strategy.  Our industry-leading offering enables IDNs to improve quality, reduce the cost of care and focus on core competencies.  We believe that market forces including continued price transparency, cost and utilization pressure, evolving healthcare payment models, capital needs, changing technology and limited resources will drive demand for our expertise.  Our key Professional Laboratory Services offerings are highlighted in table 5 below.  In 2017, we implemented new Professional Laboratory Services relationships with Montefiore Health System, a premier academic health system in the New York City area, and PeaceHealth Laboratories, in three Pacific Northwest states.

Offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation

.

Our diagnostic solutions deliver high clinical value to the medical community across the U.S.  We plan to continue to create value through scientific and product innovation and solution delivery for major clinical opportunities.  We are more than just a laboratory.  Starting with a clinical focus on a specific disease state or clinical problem, we take advantage of advanced technology for more precise, comprehensive and actionable information, and deliver the information to the medical community in a meaningful way.  We make innovative diagnostics solutions available to community physicians through our connectivity solutions, operational footprint and by making complex results actionable.  The preferred provider relationship that we announced in 2017 with U.S. Oncology Network is an example of this.  We plan to expand our innovative diagnostic solutions through research and development, as well as partnerships with academic institutions, other technology and healthcare leaders and public health agencies.  Our collaboration with Cleveland Clinic, as well as our collaboration with McKesson Specialty Health, U.S. Oncology Network and Texas Oncology, are examples we announced in 2017 of our approach to such partnerships.

Our clinical franchises, working with our research and development team, focus on these opportunities and coordinate with our commercial organization to deliver new and improved solutions.  Our franchises are designed to enable us to perform like a boutique service provider while maintaining the advantages of our scale, and to identify and access growing market segments so that we can more wisely deploy our resources and target opportunities to best serve our customers and patients.

Our 2017 introduction of QHerit genetic testing, non-fasting cholesterol testing with improved method for assessing heart disease risk and aiding treatment decisions, and our expanded Blueprint for Wellness

®

offering, as well as the continued growth of our prescription drug monitoring and toxicology and infectious diseases and immunology offerings, are recent examples of the power of our clinical franchises to deliver new solutions and foster organic growth.

Be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services

.  We plan to increase our retail presence, improve the consumer experience and offer consumers the ability to directly access our quality diagnostic information services.  We have multiple consumer-centric initiatives, shown in the following table, focused on securing growth in today's changing healthcare landscape.



The Company has a long history of focusing on consumer interests, including being the first national diagnostic information services provider to offer on-line patient appointment scheduling and a patient connectivity solution.  The Company has recently taken several actions in support of this strategy, including those set forth in the following table.

Support population health with data analytics and extended care services

.  We are working to accelerate growth by building offerings to support population health with data analytics and extended care services.  We are accelerating our efforts to leverage the power of our information assets, to offer solutions using data information services and strategies that enable our customers to deliver the most effective healthcare to the right populations and individuals.  We integrate our extensive clinical data to help manage populations and target health care solutions, and pursue opportunities to provide solutions centered on evidence-supported standards of care and guideline mandated testing.  Currently the Company is developing additional solutions based on data insights, including pre- and post-market launch pharmaceutical data services as well as clinical trial patient recruitment solutions.

We also are developing extended care services, which will leverage our assets and capabilities (

e.g

., call centers, patient service centers and mobile workforce) and our collaborative approach.  We anticipate that these services will include offerings designed to capture and document information to help healthcare providers, health plans, sponsors and IDNs deliver better care and identify and fill gaps in care for their patient populations.  Our joint venture with Wal-Mart Stores, and our Chronic Care Management offering, both launched in 2017, are examples of our efforts to accelerate growth in this manner.

2. Drive operational excellence.

We strive to enhance operational excellence and improve our quality and efficiency across every portion of our value chain and supporting operations, from the time that we interact with a potential customer until the time we receive payment.  Improving our operations will yield many benefits, including: enhancing customer experience; improving our quality and competitiveness; strengthening our foundation for growth; and increasing employee engagement and shareholder value.

We are building a superior experience, at lower cost, for all of our customers, including patients, health plans, IDNs and physicians.  We endeavor to improve our processes and effectiveness at the same time.  We are guided by a service dashboard that focuses throughout our operations on quality for patients, health care providers and employees, including medical quality, on-time delivery, competitive costs and employee safety.  We are focusing on five major themes to drive operational excellence, highlighted in the following table.



In 2017, we made strong progress on our initiatives.  For example, we completed implementation of our new logistics system,  have outfitted 60% of our patient service centers with electronic patient check-in and have reduced results-only call volume by nearly 20% compared to 2016 through increased adoption of our digital solutions.

Our cost excellence program, Invigorate, has included structured plans to drive savings and improve performance across the end-to-end value chain.

Since 2014, we have been pursuing a goal of $600 million in additional run-rate savings exiting 2017, compared to 2011.  We exited 2017 with total run-rate savings in excess of $1.3 billion, compared to 2011.  The Company plans to continue to pursue opportunities to achieve additional cost savings.

Our Strengths

We offer high value diagnostic information services and diagnostic solutions that are attractive to our customers (discussed under the heading

Customers

beginning on page 22).  We believe that our customers prefer providers that offer a comprehensive and innovative range of tests and services and convenient access to those services.  We believe that, by offering such services, we strengthen our market offering, market position and reputation.  Table 11 summarizes our strengths, which are discussed in greater detail below.

Strong operating principles

.  We have a foundation of three strong operating principles: strengthen organizational capabilities; deliver disciplined capital deployment; and remain focused on diagnostic information services.

Strengthen organizational capabilities

.

We continuously strive to strengthen our organizational capabilities to support our strategy, enable growth and productivity, better focus on our customers, speed decision-making and empower employees.  Highlights include:

•

Starting in 2012, we have made changes to our senior management team and restructured our organization to eliminate organizational barriers in our core business, provide leadership in defined geographies, eliminate three unnecessary management layers and streamline regional operations.  Our organization is designed to align around future growth opportunities, to coordinate upstream and downstream units in our business for seamless execution and to leverage our company-wide infrastructure to gain more capability, value and efficiency.

•

We established the Quest Management System to manage our Company.  This system provides a foundation for day-to-day management, and includes a common set of best-in-class business performance tools to help us



develop new capabilities to improve our Company.  The system enables us to run the Company with a common language, approach and philosophy, and supports our efforts as we build a high-performance culture, with employees focused on behaviors to make us more agile, transparent, customer-focused, collaborative and performance oriented.

•

We launched our new brand - Action from Insight

TM

- recommitting to a superior customer experience.

•

We implemented across our entire organization our Everyday Excellence program, which includes guiding principles to support a superior customer experience and to inspire our employees to be their best every day, with every person and with every customer interaction.

•

We (i) offer our Leading Quest Academy, which is designed to strengthen our more senior employee leaders through a highly experiential leadership development program focused on creating a high-performance culture and sharpening the capabilities needed to lead our organization, (ii) offer a leadership training program for our supervisor-level employees and (iii) in 2017 started a new leadership training program for our manager-level employees.

•

Reinforcing our commitment to integrity as one of our core values, we updated our Code of Ethics to better align with our brand, goals and vision.

•

Employees reported higher engagement levels compared to prior years.

Remain focused on diagnostic information services

.

We maintain a sharp focus on providing diagnostic information services.  In 2016, we completed our efforts to refocus on these services when we sold our Focus Diagnostics products business and concluded the disposition of our Celera

®

products business.   Since 2012, we also have disposed of our OralDNA

®

salivary diagnostics business, our HemoCue

®

and Enterix

®

diagnostic products businesses and ibrutinib royalty rights.  These dispositions collectively generated approximately $1 billion of proceeds.  In 2015, we also contributed our business of central laboratory testing for clinical trials to a joint venture, Q


Solutions

TM

, in which we maintain a minority interest.

Deliver disciplined capital deployment

.

We focus on shareholder returns and returns on invested capital through a framework that encompasses improving operating performance and disciplined capital deployment.

Our disciplined capital deployment framework includes dividends, share repurchases and investment in our business.  The framework is grounded in maintaining an investment grade credit rating.  We expect to return a majority of our free cash flow to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.

Consistent with that expectation, in February 2018 we announced that we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by over 11%, from $0.45 per common share to $0.50 per common share.  This represents our seventh increase in the dividend since 2011.  In December 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion increase in repurchase authority under our common stock repurchase program.  Since the beginning of 2012, we have returned more than $2.6 billion to stockholders through repurchases of our common stock.

We expect to generate 1-2% revenue growth per year through value-creating, strategically-aligned acquisitions using disciplined investment criteria.  We screen potential acquisitions using guidelines that assess strategic fit and financial considerations, including value creation, returns on invested capital and impact on our earnings.  In 2017, we acquired:

•

the outreach laboratory testing business of PeaceHealth Laboratories in the Pacific Northwest;

•

the Lewisville, Texas - based laboratory businesses Med Fusion and ClearPoint, which form the basis for our first national center of excellence in precision diagnostics for oncology.  As part of that acquisition, we became a preferred provider of advanced oncology diagnostics for the U.S. Oncology Network, consisting of over 1,400 independent, community-based physicians, and a preferred provider of a full range of inpatient and outpatient diagnostic services for 12 hospitals of Baylor Scott & White Health in North Texas;

•

the Shiel Medical Laboratory business in the greater New York City area;

•

certain assets of California Laboratory Associates, a clinical lab network serving patients and providers in the greater Los Angeles area; and



•

Cleveland HeartLab, a leader in innovative diagnostics services for managing cardiovascular disease.  We established our national cardiometabolic center of excellence at Cleveland HeartLab's laboratory facility in Cleveland.

We will continue to invest in our business in a disciplined manner, including focusing on enhancing our solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities, accelerating growth and driving operational excellence.  Our near-term investments in growth are likely to focus on the strategies to accelerate growth set forth in Table 4 above.  Our near-term investments to drive operational excellence are likely to focus on improving the customer experience and gaining efficiency, systems standardization, digital enablement of our processes and footprint optimization.

Our share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures in each of the last five years are presented in the

Selected Historical Financial Data of Our Company

section beginning on page 54.  Our acquisitions in each of the last three years are further discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Report).

Our assets and capabilities.

We are the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services.  We are the leading provider in the United States of clinical laboratory and anatomic pathology testing, and related services.

Innovation.

We are a leading innovator in diagnostic information services.  We continue to introduce new tests, including many with a focus on personalized and targeted medicine, and new services.  Our capabilities include discovery, technology development and clinical validation of diagnostic tests.  We develop tests at our esoteric laboratories, such as Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute

®

, Athena Diagnostics

TM

, Med Fusion and Cleveland HeartLab.

We successfully transfer technical innovations to the market through our in-house expertise and our relationships with technology developers, including the academic community, pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, emerging medical technology companies and others that develop and commercialize novel diagnostics, pharmaceutical and device technologies.  We search for new opportunities and continue to build a robust pipeline of new solutions.  Through our strengths in assay development and the commercialization of testing services, we believe that we are the partner of choice for developers of new technologies, services and tests to introduce their products to the marketplace.



We seek innovations and solutions that help healthcare providers care for their patients through better testing for predisposition, screening, monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment choices, and that will reduce the overall cost of healthcare.  We seek to develop innovations and solutions that help to determine a patient's genotype or gene expression profile relative to a particular disease and its potential therapies, because they can help healthcare providers to determine a patient's susceptibility to disease or to tailor medical care to an individual's needs - such as determining if a medication might be an optimum choice for a particular person, or tailoring the right dosage once the proper medicine is prescribed.  In addition, we aim to develop holistic solutions responsive to challenges that healthcare providers and patients face, by developing solutions of multiple tests, information and services focused on specific clinical challenges, and taking advantage of the latest informatics capabilities.  We also look for innovations and solutions that are less invasive than currently available options, to increase the choices that healthcare providers and patients have for the collection of diagnostic samples.  We additionally seek innovation in the ways we bring solutions to customers, and in the customer experience.

We have expertise with laboratory developed tests for companion and complementary diagnostics, and can offer an array of assets and services to support the development of companion diagnostics, including our robust data set and patient services network.

With these priorities in mind, during 2017 we introduced several new or enhanced disease area solutions, including those discussed below.



Relationships with healthcare stakeholders; collaboration

.  There are numerous stakeholders in healthcare, including insurers, employers, IDNs, physicians and other healthcare professionals, public health authorities, patients and innovators.  We have relationships across the spectrum of healthcare.  The patients we serve comprise approximately one-third of the adult population of the United States annually, and approximately one-half of the adult population in the United States over a three-year period.  We estimate that annually we serve approximately half of the physicians and half of the hospitals in the United States.

We collaborate with partners that can help us to achieve our vision of empowering better health through diagnostic insights.  Through our relationships, we believe that we are a leader in bringing to the market innovation and the ability to empower better health through diagnostic insights.  As the industry leader with the largest and broadest U.S. network and a presence outside the United States, we believe we are the distribution channel of choice for developers of new solutions, including large commercial manufacturers, academic medical centers and pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, to introduce their products to the marketplace.  We maintain relationships with advisers and consultants who are leaders in key fields of science and medicine.  We work with key groups and organizations, including world class healthcare and consumer-focused



leaders, to foster important advances in healthcare, including in precision medicine and healthcare delivery.  Some examples of our collaborations include:



Medical and Scientific Expertise

.  Our medical and scientific experts publish research that demonstrates the clinical value and importance of diagnostic testing, including in connection with our research and development efforts.  Our Quest Diagnostics Drug Testing Index

TM

, which is a periodic report of trends derived from our aggregate drug testing results, is cited by employers, the federal government and the media to help identify and quantify drug abuse among the nation's workforce. The table below provides a further sample of the activities of our scientific and medical experts.

Health Information Technology Solutions and Information Assets

.  We have a history of providing leading information technology for diagnostic information services, including for patients, clinicians and healthcare organizations.  We were the first national diagnostic information services provider to offer on-line patient appointment scheduling and a patient connectivity solution.  We focus on protecting privacy in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  Our MyQuest

®

patient healthcare portal enables patients to manage their healthcare and medical information and, among other things, use their smartphone or computer to receive and archive their Quest Diagnostics test results, find a Quest Diagnostics location and schedule appointments.  At year end 2017, over 4.8 million consumers were registered on MyQuest

®

.

We also have significant information assets, including many years of test result data, and offer a robust portfolio of powerful analytics that inspire action and deliver value to an array of customers.  With our Quanum

®

offerings, we are working on solutions designed to:

•

enhance the customer experience, including ease of use and patient and provider engagement;

•

deliver more precise, comprehensive solutions and actionable information;

•

provide increased and interactive insights and analytics to patients and providers;

•

foster greater adherence to clinical and reimbursement guidelines;

•

promote population health solutions;

•

tap the potential of large amounts of clinical information; and

•

advance the development of precision medicine.



Quality

.  Our goal is to provide every patient with services and products of superior quality.  We strive to accomplish that through commitment, leadership, and establishing rigorous processes which we measure and continually seek to improve, and by using the Quest Management System, which provides best-in-class business performance tools to create and implement effective and sustainable quality processes.  The Quest Diagnostics Quality Program includes policies and procedures to document, measure and monitor the effectiveness of our laboratory operations in providing and improving quality and meeting applicable regulatory requirements for clinical laboratory testing.  The Quality Program is designed so that the quality of laboratory services is monitored objectively and evaluated systematically to deliver superior quality care, identify opportunities to improve patient care and resolve identified problems.  To help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the diagnostics information services industry, we have implemented our Quality System Framework, which serves as a reference guide for our employees and describes our Quality System Elements, which provide the structure for each laboratory to achieve and maintain quality processes.

Customer focus.

The customer is at the center of everything we do.  Customers have a choice when it comes to selecting a healthcare provider and we strive to give them reason to put their trust in us.  We use customer insights in developing our approach and processes, listening to the voice of external and internal customers.  Focusing on a thorough understanding of customer needs and requirements, we seek to identify and implement solutions and processes that will result in a superior customer experience.  We strive to provide a superior experience for our customers because we believe that this will drive customer loyalty.  Our brand -- Action from Insight

TM

-- reflects our commitment to a superior customer experience.  We also maintain our Everyday Excellence program, which includes guiding principles to support a superior customer experience, inspiring our employees to be their best every day, with every person and with every customer interaction.

Deliver value

.  We are highly focused on delivering value to our customers.  Diagnostic information services providers differ in the services they provide and the reimbursement they receive for their services.  We believe that large diagnostic information services providers may be able to increase their share of the overall diagnostics information services industry due to their large networks and lower cost structures, including as a result of PAMA.  We take advantage of our scale, and are aware of the stakeholder dynamics impacting the healthcare markets today, including the increased responsibility of patients for health care costs.  Through the quality and breadth of services that we offer, the manner in which we offer them and the reimbursement that we receive for them, we strive to deliver value.

BUSINESS OPERATIONS

As of December 31, 2017, the Company was made up of two businesses:  Diagnostic Information Services and Diagnostic Solutions.  Our Diagnostic Information Services business develops and delivers diagnostic information services, providing insights that empower and enable a broad range of customers, including patients, clinicians, hospitals, IDNs, health plans, employers and ACOs.  Our Diagnostic Solutions group includes our risk assessment services business, which offers solutions for insurers, and our healthcare information technology businesses, which offers solutions for healthcare providers.

We leverage our capabilities and assets to serve our multiple customer bases.  Most of our services are provided in the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we derived approximately 1%, 1%, and 2%, respectively, of our net revenues from foreign operations.  For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 1% of our long-lived assets were held outside the United States.  The following table shows the percentage of our 2017 net revenues generated by the activities identified.



Diagnostic Information Services

Background - clinical testing.

Clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services.  Clinicians use clinical testing for predisposition, screening, monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment choices of diseases and other medical conditions.  Clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services.

Clinical laboratory testing, which can be characterized as routine, non-routine or advanced, generally is performed on whole blood, serum, plasma and other body fluids, such as urine, and specimens such as microbiology samples.  Clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine.  Routine testing measures various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney, heart, liver, thyroid and other organs.  Commonly ordered routine tests include blood chemistries, urinalysis, allergy tests and complete blood cell counts.  Non-routine tests may require professional “hands-on” attention from highly-skilled technical personnel, generally require more sophisticated informatics, technology, equipment or materials, may be performed less frequently than routine tests and may be reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests.  It may be not practical, from a cost-effectiveness or infrastructure perspective, for many hospitals, IDNs, ACOs, commercial laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of non-routine tests, or to perform low-volume non-routine testing in-house.  Such tests generally are outsourced to a clinical testing laboratory which can perform these non-routine tests.  Some non-routine tests are advanced.  Advanced tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics (including next-generation sequencing), oncology, neurology, companion diagnostics and non-invasive pre-natal and other germline genetic testing.

Anatomic pathology services are performed on tissues, such as biopsies, and other samples, such as human cells.  Anatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients.

Our services.

We are the world's largest provider of diagnostic information services.  We provide information and insights based on the industry-leading menu of routine, non-routine and advanced clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing, and other diagnostic information services.  We have built strong testing capabilities, including services for the predisposition, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancers and other diseases, and offer advanced tests in many fields, including endocrinology, immunology, neurology and oncology.  Increasingly, we are focused on providing solutions and insights to our customers, based on the testing that we perform, the data that we gather and our extensive medical, information and connectivity assets.  We believe that offering services, solutions and insights based on a full range of tests, information assets and other capabilities strengthens our market offering, market position and reputation.

The value creation side of our business is organized by clinical franchise and focuses on customer solutions for the marketplace, including new test development and diagnostic insights.  It also includes product and commercial marketing.  The value delivery side includes sales, laboratory operations, field operations, logistics and client services.

THE UNITED STATES CLINICAL TESTING INDUSTRY

The U.S. clinical testing industry consists of two segments.  The following table discusses how we believe the industry is structured.



Key Trends

The healthcare system in the United States is evolving; significant change is taking place in the system.  We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue, and that industry change is likely to be extensive.  There are a number of key trends that are having, and that we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the United States and on our business.  These trends are discussed in the chart below; they present both opportunities and risks.  We believe that several of the trends, including demographics, price transparency, consolidation, increased consumer involvement and value-based pricing, are favorable to our business.  Because diagnostic information services is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below, we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term and that we are well positioned to benefit from the long-term growth expected in the industry.









Healthcare services delivery

Healthcare delivery is moving out of hospitals, doctor offices and other traditional locations in which it had been provided.  Care is increasingly being provided in new settings, such as out-patient and home settings.  For example, see the discussion of

Emerging Retail Healthcare Providers

in Table 21.  This dynamic offers new opportunities and challenges for healthcare providers and reflects not only efforts to take advantage of new technologies, but also the focus, discussed in this table above under the heading

Reimbursement pressure; affordability

, on controlling the overall cost of healthcare.

The Value of Diagnostic Information Services

As noted in Table 19, there is an increased focus on the affordability of healthcare.  There also is increased focus on a disease-oriented approach to diagnostics, treatment and management. Healthcare providers, consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic information services as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection, prevention and treatment.  Healthcare providers increasingly rely on diagnostic information services to help identify risk for a disease, to detect the symptoms of disease earlier, to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen, to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results.  The following table highlights how diagnostic information services can be an important contributor to reducing health care costs and improving care.

Customers

We provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers, including those discussed below.  As discussed in Table 19 above, customers are consolidating, converging and diversifying.







In many cases, the customer that orders our services is not responsible to pay for them. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, the payer may be the patient or a third party, such as a health plan, Medicare or a Medicaid program.  In light of healthcare reform, there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models, including bundled payment models.  Increasingly, patients are bearing responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them, even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment.

GENERAL

Competition.

While there has been significant consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years, our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive.  We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: commercial clinical laboratories, hospital-affiliated laboratories and physician-office laboratories.  Our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Inc.  In addition, we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized advanced laboratories.  In anatomic pathology, we compete with anatomic pathology practices, including those in academic institutions and large physician group practices.  There also has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities and/or bring pathologists into their practices, thereby reducing referrals from these practices and increasing the competitive position of  these practices.

We believe that healthcare providers consider a number of factors when selecting a diagnostic information services provider.  Those factors include:



We believe that providing the most attractive service offering in the industry, including the most comprehensive test menu, innovative test offerings, a positive customer experience, a staff including medical and scientific experts, strong quality, unparalleled access and distribution, and data-powered integrated information technology solutions provide us with a competitive advantage.

We believe that large diagnostic information services providers may be able to increase their share of the overall diagnostic information services industry due to their large networks and lower cost structures, including as a result of PAMA.  These advantages should enable larger providers to more effectively serve customers.  In addition, we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue.  However, a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals, which generally have affiliations with community clinicians and may have more, or more convenient, locations in a market.  As a result, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability, quality and pricing.  In addition, market activity may increase the competitive environment.  For example, health plan actions to exclude large national providers from contracts may enhance the relative competitive position of regional providers.  In addition, increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices may enhance the ties of the clinicians to hospital-affiliated laboratories, enhancing the competitive position of hospital-affiliated laboratories.  The formation of ACOs and IDNs, and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers, in addition to the impact of informatics, also may impact competition to provide diagnostic information services.

The diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions. Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing.  Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices; (2) testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.

The risk assessment and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive.  We have many competitors, some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources.  We compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience, faster services completion and a wider array of quality, integrated services than our competitors.  We compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers, including smaller and medium sized physician practices.

Sales and Marketing.

Our Diagnostic Information Services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sale of most of our services.  It coordinates closely with our clinical franchises and marketing organization.  The commercial organization is centrally led, and is organized regionally, in conjunction with our operations organization, to focus on local customer needs and to ensure aligned delivery for our customers.  We have built excellence in our commercial organization, employing world-class processes and tools as well as strong management discipline.  We continue to invest in talent, provide industry-leading training and development, focus on opportunities with IDNs and specialty physicians, and foster a customer-focused, performance-driven culture.

We also maintain sales and marketing organizations for our employer drugs-of-abuse testing services in Diagnostic Information Services and our offerings in Diagnostic Solutions.

Information Technology.

We use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test ordering and reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data.  We endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our Company and customers.  The successful delivery of our services depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems.  We have taken precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our information technology systems.

Some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and, as a result, we continue to use multiple information systems.  We have implemented some common systems, and are planning to standardize laboratory information and billing systems across our operations.  We expect that our standardization effort will take several more years to complete, and will result in significantly more centralized systems, improved operating efficiency, more positive customer experiences and enhanced control over our operational environment.  Even after we complete our efforts to standardize our historic systems, acquisitions of other businesses in the future may create additional opportunities where we may conclude that system standardization would benefit our company.

Quality Assurance.

As discussed further under the heading

Quality

beginning on page 14, our goal is to provide every patient with services and products of superior quality, and to meet that goal we have adopted the Quest Diagnostics



Quality Program.  This program includes policies and procedures that document, measure and monitor the effectiveness of our laboratory operations in providing and improving quality and meeting applicable regulatory requirements for clinical laboratory testing.  We use the Quest Management System, including standard frameworks and methodologies for project and change management, to manage our Company, and have a culture of continuous improvement.  Employing root cause analysis, process improvements and rigorous tracking and measuring, we seek to enhance quality, continuously reduce defects, streamline processes, further increase the efficacy and efficiency of our operations and processes, eliminate waste and help standardize operations across our Company.  We also have a robust Supplier Quality Program designed to ensure we have a high quality supplier network and to raise the bar of quality expectations across that network.

In our laboratory operations, our quality assurance efforts focus on pre-analytic, analytic and post-analytic processes, including positive patient identification of specimens, specimen tracking, analysis and report accuracy, proficiency testing, reference range relevance, process audits, statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers.  As part of our quality assurance program, we utilize internal proficiency testing, comprehensive quality control and rigorous process audits.  For most clinical laboratory tests, quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens.  The results of tests on these quality control samples are monitored to identify trends, biases or imprecision in our analytical processes.  We also focus on the licensing, credentialing, training and competence of our professional and technical staff.

In addition, we participate in external proficiency testing and have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations, such as CMS, CAP and certain states.  All of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs, including proficiency testing programs administered by CAP or states. CAP is an independent, nongovernmental organization of board-certified pathologists approved by CMS to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by CLIA.  CAP offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe. All of our major laboratories, including our laboratories outside the U.S., and most of our rapid response laboratories, are accredited by CAP.  Accreditation includes on-site inspections and participation in the CAP (or equivalent) proficiency testing program.  Also, our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an internal peer-review evaluation and one or more external individual proficiency testing programs.  In addition, some of our laboratories have achieved International Organization for Standardization certification for their quality management systems.

Intellectual Property Rights.

We own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries.  From time to time, we also license U.S. and non-U.S. patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights or trademarks owned by others; we also may license our intellectual property to others. In the aggregate, our intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business.  We believe, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole.

Our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets, to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise.  We actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products, processes and other intellectual property where possible.

Our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic information services industry by continuing to introduce new tests, technology and services will depend, in part, on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms.  Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing, that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our tests or operate our business.

Enterprise Risk Management Program

.  We maintain an enterprise risk management program designed to assure a culture of risk awareness throughout the Company's key business, operations and support functions.  Our program, which is integrated with the Company’s governance, performance management and internal control frameworks, entails a formal continuous process that identifies, assesses, mitigates and manages both internal and external conditions that could significantly impact the Company and influence its business strategy and performance.  The program is based on a framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and focuses on the following risk types:

•

Operational risk - risks arising from systems, processes, people and external events that affect the Company’s operational objectives or fundamental reason for its existence, including: product life-cycle and execution; service quality and performance; information management and data protection and security, including cybersecurity; supply chain and business disruption; and other risks, including human capital and reputation.



•

Financial risk - risks arising from the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations pursuant to its strategic and operational objectives, including exposure to broad market and more specific industry risk that could impact liquidity, interest rate, credit, pricing and reimbursement, and also to internal and external financial reporting.

•

Legal and compliance risk - risks arising from government and regulatory environment and action, legal proceedings and compliance with integrity policies and procedures.

•

Strategic risk - risks that will impede the Company’s plan to achieve its mission and vision and apply its core values, including changes in the broad market and Company's industry, business development and restructuring activities, competitive threats and practices, technology and product innovation, and public policy.

As part of our program, executive management routinely assesses our enterprise level risks, overall Company-level risk tolerance and the effectiveness of risk management, and monitors the progress of and resources applied to risk mitigation; our Board of Directors plays an active role in overseeing our program.  Our primary risk factors are discussed in

Risk Factors

beginning on page 35.

Employees.

At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 45,000 people.  This total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority ownership interest.  We have no collective bargaining agreements with unions covering employees in the United States, and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good.

BILLING AND REIMBURSEMENT

Billing.

We generally bill for diagnostic information services on a fee-for-service basis under one of two types of fee schedules. These fees may be negotiated or discounted.  The types of fee schedules are:

•

“Client” fees charged to physicians, hospitals and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis and which are billed on a monthly basis.

•

“Patient” fees charged to individual patients and certain third-party payers on a claim-by-claim basis.

Billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated, and we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing.  Patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians, hospitals, IDNs, ACOs and employer groups all have different billing requirements. Some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers, and there are several other factors that complicate billing (

e.g

., disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers; and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering clinicians).  We incur additional costs as a result of our participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs because diagnostic testing services are subject to complex, stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations, including those relating to coverage, billing and reimbursement.  Additionally, auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process.  Changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing costs.  CMS establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage.

As an integral part of our billing compliance program, we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements.  Any Medicare or Medicaid overpayments resulting from non-compliance are reimbursed by us.  As a result of these efforts, we have periodically identified and reported overpayments, reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action.

Our bad debt expense is primarily the result of the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility.  Increased patient financial responsibility has adversely impacted our bad debt expense in recent years; additional increases in patient financial responsibility may further negatively impact our bad debt expense.  The remainder of our bad debt expense is primarily due to missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions and Advance Beneficiary Notices received from healthcare providers.  In general, due to the nature of our business, historically we have performed the requested testing and reported test results regardless of whether the billing information is correct or complete.  We subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information.  Missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process, creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense.  We are taking, and plan to continue to take, steps to reduce our bad debt expense, including increasing use of electronic ordering, which reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information, and real-time payment determination.



Government Coverage and Reimbursements.

Government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps and are expected to continue to take steps to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including clinical testing services.  Historically, most Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs administered by the federal government.  Over the last several years, the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs, called “Medicare Advantage” programs.  There has been growth of health insurance providers offering Medicare Advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs.  In recent years, in an effort to control costs, states also have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements.

With regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries, we must bill Medicare directly and must accept the local Medicare carrier's fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full.  In addition, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more (and in most instances, pay significantly less) than Medicare.  Currently, Medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a co-payment for diagnostic information services reimbursed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, but generally does require a patient deductible for anatomic pathology services.

Part B of the Medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients, including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local Medicare clinical testing fee schedules.  Historically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule established under that program have been subject to change, including each year.  Pursuant to PAMA, which was implemented in 2018, CMS has revised the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule.  Under the revised Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing will be reduced in 2018, 2019 and 2020.  PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates; further reduction in reimbursement may result from such revisions.  The following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues reimbursed under Medicare and Medicaid in 2017.

Violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs or federal and state fraud and abuse laws may result in: exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid programs; civil and criminal fines and penalties; and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business.  Certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal False Claims Act, including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed.

REGULATION

Our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including some particular to our business and others relating to conducting business generally (

e.g

., U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act).  We also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies. The table below highlights the key regulatory schemes applicable to our businesses.





Compliance.

We strive to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  All of our laboratories and, where applicable, patient service centers, are licensed and accredited as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies.  We have a long-standing and well-established compliance program.  The Quality, Safety and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees, and receives periodic management reports regarding, our compliance program.  Our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the implementation and observance of all applicable laws, regulations and Company policies.  Further, we conduct in-depth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations.  We conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures.

Many of the laws and regulations applicable to us, including many of those relating to billing, reimbursement for tests and relationships with clinicians and hospitals, are vague or indefinite or have not been interpreted by the courts.  The applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science, healthcare technology and healthcare organizations.  They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our pricing and/or billing practices.  Such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could, among other things:

•

increase our administrative, billing or other operating costs;

•

decrease the amount of reimbursement related to diagnostic information services performed;

•

damage our reputation; or

•

adversely affect important business relationships with third parties.

If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Certain federal and state statutes, regulations and other laws, including the

qui tam



provisions of federal and state false claims acts, allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers, private payers and/or patients alleging inappropriate billing practices.

The federal or state governments may bring claims based on our current practices, which we believe are lawful.  The federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  We believe that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud.  Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel with substantial funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY

The following persons serve as executive officers of the Company.





Item 1A. Risk Factors

You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Report, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of our securities.  The risks below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we presently deem immaterial, may also negatively impact us.  Our business, consolidated financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability, reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors.

This Report also includes forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties.  Our results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks we face described below and elsewhere.  See “Cautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results” on page 43.

The U.S. healthcare system is evolving, and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt.

The U.S. healthcare system is evolving, in part in response to the passage of the ACA in 2010. The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs. The ACA provided for extensive health insurance reforms, including the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage, fixed percentages on medical loss ratios, expansion in Medicaid and other programs, employer mandates, individual mandates, creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges, and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage. The ACA also permits the establishment of ACOs.

The President of the United States has announced that he favors repealing the ACA.  In 2017, the federal legislature undertook efforts to repeal, revise or replace the ACA, and the individual mandate adopted as part of the ACA was repealed.  In more recent legislation, some additional aspects of the ACA were modified: another two-year moratorium was implemented on the device tax imposed on the sellers of certain medical devices in the U.S., including those purchased and used by laboratories; the tax on health insurers was delayed for a year; and the "Cadillac tax" on certain employee benefit plans was also delayed for two years.  As part of legislation enacted in early 2018,  the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which under the ACA was to be responsible annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing Medicare cost growth while preserving quality, was repealed.  The scope and timing of any further legislation to repeal, amend, replace, or reform the rest of the ACA is uncertain, but if such legislation were to become law, it could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare system.  In addition, uncertainty regarding the ACA prior to any such repeal, amendment, replacement or reform could create uncertainty generally in the healthcare market.



Significant change is taking place in the healthcare system, including as discussed above under the heading

The United States Clinical Testing Industry

, beginning on page 17.  For example, ACOs, IDNs and patient-centered medical homes have grown as a means to deliver patient care.  Value-based reimbursement is increasing; CMS has set goals for value-based reimbursement to be achieved.  Patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for, and often are bearing increased responsibility for payment for, their healthcare.  Healthcare industry participants are consolidating.  Healthcare services increasingly are being provided by non-traditional providers (

e.g

., physician assistants), in non-traditional venues (

e.g.

, retail medical clinics, urgent care centers) and using new technologies (

e.g.

, telemedicine).  Utilization of the healthcare system is being influenced by several factors, and may result in a decline in the demand for diagnostic information services.  We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue, and that industry change is likely to be extensive.

The clinical testing business is highly competitive, and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.

The clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry.  We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: other commercial clinical laboratories, hospital-affiliated laboratories and physician-office laboratories. We also compete with other providers, including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices. Hospitals generally maintain on-site laboratories to perform testing on their patients (inpatient or outpatient). In addition, many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach (non-hospital patients) testing.  Hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital's laboratory.  As a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing. In addition, hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospital's laboratory. In recent years, there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices, increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals.  Increased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position.  The formation of ACOs and IDNs, and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers, in addition to the impact of informatics, also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services.

The diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions. Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing.  Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices; (2) advanced testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.

Government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including clinical testing services.

We face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services.  We expect efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue.

From time to time, Congress has legislated reductions in, or frozen updates to, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. In addition, CMS has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform. We also provide physician services that are reimbursed by Medicare under a physician fee schedule, which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis.  In recent years, reductions in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for anatomic pathology services adversely impacted our business relative to the business of some of our competitors whose anatomic pathology business was not as sizable as ours.  Medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures. The ACA includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels.

In addition, over the last several years, the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries, called “Medicare Advantage” programs, and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs.  There has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering Medicare Advantage programs, and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs.  Also, states have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements.  Recently, state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business, such as delaying payments, reducing reimbursement, restricting coverage eligibility, denying claims and service coverage restrictions.

From time to time, the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding could be used to provide clinical testing services for Medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care.  Congress



periodically considers cost-saving initiatives.  These initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical testing services, co-payments for clinical testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions.

PAMA is impacting the diagnostic information services industry.  Pursuant to this legislation, CMS has revised the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for 2018, 2019 and 2020.  Under the revised Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is scheduled to be reduced in 2018, 2019 and 2020.  PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates; further reduction in reimbursement may result from such revisions.

Health plans and other third parties have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services, including clinical testing services.

We face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers, including health plans, to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services.  For example, since the passage of ACA, there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models, including bundled payment models.  We expect continuing efforts by third-party payers, including in their rules, practices and policies, to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services.  ACOs and IDNs also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of, or reimbursement for, diagnostic information services.

The healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans, resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers, including clinical testing providers. These health plans, and independent physician associations, may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements. In addition, some health plans have been willing to limit the PPO or POS laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved fee-for-service pricing; we may cease to be a contracted provider to a health plan.  Some health plans also are reviewing test coding, evaluating coverage decisions and requiring preauthorization of certain testing.  There are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing.

The increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer. The ACA included provisions, including regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges, that may encourage health insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting.

Government payers and third parties, including health plans, may not recognize the value of, or compensate or reimburse us for, new and innovative solutions.

Government payers and third parties, including health plans, are taking steps to reduce utilization of, and reimbursement for, some new and innovative healthcare solutions, including new tests and other solutions that we may offer.

In 2017, CMS issued a draft national coverage policy for next-generation sequencing cancer panels.  The draft policy, were it finalized without change, would effect a

de facto

requirement that each laboratory test using next generation sequencing technology would need to be approved or cleared by the FDA before it is covered by Medicare.  Third parties, including health plans, have not announced any change in approach to coverage for next-generation sequencing cancer panels.

The American Medical Association CPT

®

Editorial Panel is continuing its process of establishing new billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing and toxicology testing. The adoption of these codes on certain occasions has led, and could continue to lead, to limited coverage decisions, payment denials or new procedures or conditions for payment.  Payment levels for many new codes remain largely unresolved and healthcare providers continue to address implementation of the new codes.

These steps may discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer.

Our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency.

It is important that we continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including diagnostic information services.



Business development activities are inherently risky, and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult.

We plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities, such as acquisitions, licensing, investments and alliances. However, these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities. Moreover, the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity, and to integrate it into our business. The success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities, but also on the property, resources, efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners. Further, disputes may arise with strategic partners, due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests.

Each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that has different systems, processes, policies and cultures. Integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired, difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies, the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies, challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses, and potential adverse effects on operating results. The process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses as a result of the following difficulties, among others:

•

loss of key customers or employees;

•

difficulty in standardizing information and other systems;

•

difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure;

•

failure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that our Company has historically provided;

•

diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of our Company as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties; and

•

the added costs of dealing with such disruptions.

If we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. Even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration, either in monetary terms or in a timely manner.

We are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities, and we may face substantial fines and penalties, and our business activities may be impacted, if we fail to comply.

Our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (including at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business. While we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws, many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, including many of those relating to:

•

billing and reimbursement of clinical testing;

•

certification or licensure of clinical laboratories;

•

the anti-self-referral and anti-kickback laws and regulations;

•

the laws and regulations administered by the FDA;

•

the corporate practice of medicine;

•

operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical testing services are accurate, reliable and timely;

•

physician fee splitting;

•

relationships with physicians and hospitals;

•

safety and health of laboratory employees; and

•

handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials.

These laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our pricing and/or billing practices. We may not be able to maintain, renew or secure required permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or if we fail to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our



business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected.

We regularly receive requests for information, and occasionally subpoenas, from governmental authorities. We also are subject from time to time to

qui tam

claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers.” The federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud.  Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantial funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse.  In addition, the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, these types of investigations and related litigation can result in:

•

diversion of management time and attention;

•

expenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, costs and payment of damages;

•

limitations on our ability to continue some of our operations;

•

enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages;

•

decreased demand for our services; and/or

•

injury to our reputation.

Although we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion. Moreover, even when an investigation is resolved favorably, the process may be time-consuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive.

Changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted, or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs, delay, modification, withdrawal or reconsideration. Such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives.

Our business could be adversely impacted by the FDA's approach to regulation.

The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, software, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the U.S.  A number of tests we develop internally are offered as LDTs. The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories.

Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA has issued guidance regarding the regulation of clinical decision support software, which may be used in, or in connection with, LDTs. The guidance has created uncertainty regarding whether FDA approval of certain tests is required.

In 2017, the FDA published a "Discussion Document" providing its views on legislative alternatives to regulate LDTs.  New legislation could significantly impact the clinical laboratory testing business, including by increasing or modifying the regulation of LDTs, hindering our ability to develop and market new services, causing an increase in the cost of our services, delaying our ability to introduce new tests or hindering our ability to perform testing.

Failure to accurately bill for our services, or to comply with applicable laws relating to government healthcare programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Billing for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, clinicians, hospitals and employer groups.  The majority of billing and related operations for our Company are being provided by a third party under the Company's oversight.  Failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences, including: (1) exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business.



Failure in our information technology systems, including failures resulting from our systems conversions, could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information, customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business.

IT systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. IT systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, system conversion or standardization initiatives, human acts and natural disasters.

Despite the security measures we have implemented, our IT systems may be subject to unauthorized tampering, cyber attack or other security breach.

Unauthorized persons may seek to obtain intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our IT systems.  In December 2016, we reported that an internet application on our IT network had been the target of an external cyber attack, resulting in the theft of certain patient data.  The accessed data did not include Social Security numbers, credit card information, or insurance and other financial information, and there is no indication that patient data has been misused in any way.  When the intrusion was discovered, we immediately took steps to stop any further unauthorized activity.  We may be subject to litigation and governmental investigation, and may suffer reputational damage, as a result of the data breach, which could have an adverse impact on our business.

In addition to the data breach reported in December 2016, our IT systems from time to time have experienced other attacks, viruses, attempted intrusions or similar problems, but each was mitigated.  Although none materially disrupted, interrupted, damaged or shutdown the Company's IT systems, materially disrupted the Company's performance of its business or, to the Company's knowledge, resulted in material unauthorized access to data, there can be no assurance that we will be able to similarly mitigate future attacks, viruses or intrusions.

We have taken, and continue to take, precautionary measures to reduce the risk of, better detect and respond to future cyber threats, and prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our IT systems, including the loss or theft of intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our systems.  In addition, we collaborate with government agencies regarding potential cyber threats and have worked with a leading cyber security firm to evaluate and strengthen our systems.  However, cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them.  Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers, compromise intellectual property or confidential information or otherwise adversely impact our business.  There can be no assurances that our precautionary measures will prevent or successfully defend against cyber threats that could have a significant impact on our business.

Failure to develop, or acquire licenses for, new tests, technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues.

The diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions. Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs. In addition, they could introduce new tests, technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services. Our success in continuing to introduce new solutions, technology and services will depend, in part, on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms. We may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services. We also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements, and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests. If we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, our research and development costs may increase as a result. In addition, if we are unable to develop and introduce, or license, new solutions, technology and services to expand our advanced testing capabilities, our services may become outdated when compared with our competition.

We may be unable to obtain, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business.

We may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights. In addition, we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, which could force us to do one or more of the following:



•

cease developing, performing or selling solutions or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

•

obtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right;

•

redesign or re-engineer our tests;

•

change our business processes; or

•

pay substantial damages, court costs and attorneys' fees, including potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful.

The development of new, more cost-effective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients, and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians, could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues.

The diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing.  Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by clinicians in their offices; (2) complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.  Advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing.  Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under CLIA and may be performed by patients in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits.

Some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services, including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures, such as dermatologists, gastroenterologists, urologists and oncologists, have added in-office histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site.  Hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing, including some non-routine and advanced testing.  Internalization of testing may reduce demand for services previously referred to outside service providers, such as the Company.

Our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility.

As of

December 31, 2017

, we had approximately

$3.8 billion

of debt outstanding. Except for operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements in place or available. Our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants. These restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt. We have obtained ratings on our debt from Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings. There can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency's judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our Company or our industry, so warrant. If such ratings are lowered, our borrowing costs could increase. Changes in our credit ratings, however, do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt.

We or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we incur additional debt, a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. In that case, it may be more difficult, or we may be unable, to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us. As a result, we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic, industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness.

Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.

Our people are a critical resource. The supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong.  We may lose, or fail to attract and retain, key management personnel, or qualified skilled technical or professional employees (

e.g.

, pathologists).

Failure to establish, and perform to, appropriate quality standards to assure that the appropriate standard of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation.

The provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks. The services that we provide are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care. Therefore, users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes.



Negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events. We may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists, laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospital-based pathologists. We are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation.

Our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies.

In our business, we generate or maintain sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information. If we do not adequately safeguard that information (including in compliance with the requirements of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation beginning in May 2018) and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it, our business could be impaired, our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation.  We may be subject to litigation and governmental investigation, and may suffer reputational damage, as a result of a data breach, which could have an adverse impact on our business.

We are subject to numerous political, legal, operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways.

Although we conduct most of our business in the United States, our international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets. Depending on the market, these risks include without limitation:

•

changes in the local economic environment;

•

political instability;

•

social changes;

•

intellectual property legal protections and remedies;

•

trade regulations;

•

procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of services;

•

exchange controls;

•

attracting and retaining qualified employees;

•

local market practices;

•

export and import controls;

•

weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights;

•

changes in local laws or regulations; and

•

potentially longer payment and collection cycles.

International operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets, to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures.

Our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, health pandemics, hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities.

Our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, health pandemics, hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities. Such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees' ability to perform their job duties. In addition, such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens, to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services.

Adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation.

We are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, among other things, disputes as to intellectual property, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and Medicare or Medicaid carriers. Some proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert management's attention from operations. The proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

There are no unresolved SEC comments that require disclosure.

Item 2. Properties

Our executive offices are located in Secaucus, New Jersey.  We maintain clinical testing laboratories throughout the continental United States; in several instances a joint venture of which we are a partner maintains the laboratory.  We also maintain offices, data centers, call centers, distribution centers and patient service centers at locations throughout the United States.  In addition, we maintain offices, patient service centers and clinical laboratories in locations outside the United States, including in Puerto Rico, Mexico, India and Ireland.  Our properties that are not owned are leased on terms and for durations that are reflective of commercial standards in the communities where these properties are located. We believe that, in general, our facilities are suitable and adequate for our current and anticipated future levels of operation and are adequately maintained.  We believe that if we were unable to renew a lease on any of our facilities, we could find alternative space at competitive market rates and relocate our operations to such new location without material disruption to our business.  Several of our principal facilities are highlighted below.

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our Company

Diagnostic Information Services

Quest Diagnostics empowers people to take action to improve health outcomes.  We use our extensive database of clinical lab results to derive diagnostic insights that reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management.  Our diagnostic information services business ("DIS") provides information and insights based on the industry-leading menu of routine, non-routine and advanced clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing, and other diagnostic information services.  We provide services to a broad range of customers, including patients, clinicians, hospitals, independent delivery networks ("IDNs"), health plans, employers and accountable care organizations ("ACOs").  We offer the broadest access in the United States to diagnostic information services through our nationwide network of laboratories, patient service centers and phlebotomists in physician offices and our connectivity resources, including call centers and mobile paramedics, nurses and other health and wellness professionals.  We are the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services.  We provide interpretive consultation with one of the largest medical and scientific staffs in the industry.  Our DIS business makes up over 90% of our consolidated net revenues.  During


, we processed approximately

164 million

test requisitions through our extensive laboratory network.

The clinical testing that we perform is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services.  Clinicians use clinical testing for predisposition, screening, monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment choices of diseases and other medical conditions.  The United States clinical testing industry consists of two segments.  One segment, which we believe makes up approximately 37% of the total industry, includes hospital inpatient and outpatient testing.  The second segment, which we believe makes up approximately 63% of the total industry, includes testing of persons who are not hospital patients, including testing done in commercial clinical laboratories, physician-office laboratories and other locations, as well as hospital outreach (non-hospital patients) testing.  We believe that hospital-affiliated laboratories account for approximately 35% of the second segment, commercial clinical laboratories approximately 54% and physician-office laboratories and other locations account for the balance.

The clinical testing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations in operating results and cash flows.  Typically, testing volume declines during vacation and major holiday periods, reducing net revenues and operating cash flows below annual averages.  Testing volume is also subject to declines due to severe weather or other events, which can deter patients from having testing performed and which can vary in duration and severity from year to year.  Additionally, orders for clinical testing generated from physician offices, hospitals and employers can be affected by factors such as changes in the United States economy and regulatory environment, which affect the number of unemployed and uninsured, and design changes in healthcare plans, which affect the number of physician office and hospital visits.

Diagnostic Solutions

In our Diagnostic Solutions ("DS") businesses, which represents the balance of our consolidated net revenues, we offer a variety of solutions for life insurers and healthcare organizations and clinicians.  We are the leading provider of risk assessment services for the life insurance industry.  In addition, we offer healthcare organizations and clinicians robust information technology solutions.  Prior to the sale of our Focus Diagnostics products business on May 13, 2016 ("Focus Sale") our diagnostics products business manufactured and marketed diagnostic products.  Prior to the contribution of our clinical trials testing business to the Q


Solutions joint venture on July 1, 2015 ("Clinical Trials Contribution"), our clinical trials testing business was a leading provider of central laboratory testing for clinical trials.

For further details regarding the Focus Sale and the Clinical Trials Contribution, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

Two Point Strategy

Our two point strategy is described in detail in "

Item 1. Business: Our Strategy and Strengths

."  We continued to execute on our strategy during


as follows:

Acquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Service Business of PeaceHealth Laboratories

On May 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the outreach laboratory services operations of PeaceHealth Laboratories ("PHL"), in an all-cash transaction for $101 million.  The acquired outreach laboratory service business of PHL is included in our DIS business.  Under a professional laboratory services agreement, Quest will also manage 11 laboratories, which PHL will continue to own.

Acquisition of Med Fusion and Clearpoint

On July 14, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Med Fusion, LLC and Clearpoint Diagnostic Laboratories, LLC ("Med Fusion") in an all-cash transaction for $150 million.  Med Fusion provides precision medicine diagnostics to aid cancer treatment nationwide and the acquired businesses form the Company's center of excellence in precision diagnostics for oncology.  The acquired laboratory service businesses are included in our DIS business.

Acquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Service Business of The William W. Backus Hospital and The Hospital of Central Connecticut

On September 28, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the outreach laboratory service businesses of two hospitals of Hartford HealthCare Corporation, The William W. Backus Hospital and The Hospital of Central Connecticut in an all-cash transaction for $30 million.  The acquired outreach laboratory service businesses are included in our DIS business.

Acquisition of Cleveland HeartLab, Inc.

On December 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of  Cleveland HeartLab, Inc. ("CHL") in an all-cash transaction for $94 million, net of $12 million cash acquired.  CHL is a specialty clinical laboratory and disease management company, which forms the basis for our advanced diagnostics center of excellence in cardiovascular testing.  The acquired business is included in our DIS business.

Acquisition of the Clinical and Anatomic Pathology Laboratory Business of Shiel Holdings, LLC

On December 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of the clinical and anatomic pathology laboratory business of Shiel Holdings, LLC ("Shiel") in an all-cash transaction for $176 million, which consisted of cash consideration of $170 million and contingent consideration estimated at $6 million.  The contingent consideration arrangement is dependent upon the achievement of certain testing volume benchmarks.  Shiel serves the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area.  The acquired business is included in our DIS business.

For further details regarding our acquisitions, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.



Collaboration with Wal-Mart

In June 2017, we announced our collaboration with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Wal-Mart") to help improve access to care and, over time, help lower healthcare costs through providing basic healthcare services.  The collaboration has launched with a select number of co-branded sites opening within Wal-Mart stores that are initially providing laboratory testing services. Over time, service offerings are expected to expand to include other basic healthcare services.

Invigorate Program

We are engaged in a multi-year program called Invigorate, which is designed to reduce our cost structure and improve our performance.  We delivered more than $700 million in run-rate savings (compared to 2011) as we exited 2014, and delivered more than $1.3 billion in run rate savings (compared to 2011) as we exited 2017, exceeding our goal that we announced in November 2014.

Invigorate has consisted of several flagship programs, with structured plans in each, to drive savings and improve performance across the customer value chain.  These flagship programs include: organization excellence; information technology excellence; procurement excellence; field and customer service excellence; lab excellence; and revenue services excellence.  In addition to these programs, we identified key themes to change how we operate in order to meet our goal of delivering the $1.3 billion of run-rate savings as we exited 2017.  These additional key themes include: standardizing our processes, information technology systems, equipment and data; enhancing electronic enabling services; and enhancing reimbursement for work we perform.  We believe that our efforts to standardize our information technology systems, equipment and data also foster our efforts to strengthen our foundation for growth and support the value creation initiatives of our clinical franchises by enhancing our operational flexibility, empowering and enhancing the customer experience, facilitating the delivery of actionable insights and bolstering our large data platform.

In January 2015, we adopted a course of action related to this multi-year program. We developed a high-level estimate of the total pre-tax charges expected to be incurred in 2015 through 2017 in connection with the course of action for the program: $300 million.  In February 2017, we developed high-level estimates of the pre-tax charges expected to be incurred in 2017 totaling $60 million to $80 million, consisting of up to $10 million of employee separation costs and $60 million to $70 million of systems conversion and integration costs.

During 2017 we incurred $90 million of pre-tax charges including $23 million of employee separation costs and other restructuring related costs with the remainder primarily consisting of systems conversion and integration costs.  From 2015 through December 31, 2017, the cumulative pre-tax charges incurred in connection with the Invigorate program were $242 million, including $73 million of cumulative employee separation costs and other restructuring related costs.

For further details of the Invigorate program and associated costs, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Outlook and Trends

The healthcare system in the United States is evolving; significant change is taking place in the system.  We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue, and that industry change is likely to be extensive.  There are a number of key trends that are having, and that we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the United States and on our business.  These trends present both opportunities and risks.  However, because diagnostic information services is an essential healthcare service, we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long-term and that we are well-positioned to benefit from the long-term growth expected in the industry.

Healthcare market participants, including governments, are focusing on controlling costs, including potentially by changing reimbursement for healthcare services (including but not limited to a shift from fee for service to capitation), changing medical coverage policies (

e.g

., healthcare benefits design), preauthorization of laboratory testing, requiring co-pays, introducing laboratory spend management utilities and payment and patient care innovations such as ACOs and patient-centered medical homes.  As health plans and government programs require greater levels of patient cost-sharing, our patient collections could be negatively impacted and adversely impact our results of operations.  As previously mentioned, there could be a shift to capitation arrangements where we agree to a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member enrolled in a restricted plan, generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us.  In both


and


, we derived approximately 11% of our testing volume and 4% of our DIS revenues from capitated payment arrangements.

Historically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule ("CLFS") and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule established under Part B of the Medicare program have been subject to change, including each year.  On November 17, 2017,



the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") finalized the 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS pursuant to Protecting Access to Medicare Act ("PAMA"). The Company expects the impact on our CLFS based revenues (in 2017 CLFS revenues comprised 12% of our consolidated net revenues) as a result of PAMA to be a reduction of approximately 4% in 2018, and approximately 10% in both 2019 and 2020.  PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates; further reduction in reimbursement may result from such revisions.  Excluding the impact of PAMA we expect reimbursement pressure for our DIS business in 2018 to remain less than 1%, with PAMA adding an additional 0.5%.

On December 22, 2017, the President signed the TCJA into law.  Pursuant to the law, among other changes to U.S. corporate income tax laws, the federal corporate statutory income tax rate is reduced from 35% to 21% effective for 2018; and a mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits will result in a repatriation toll charge.  Our activities are primarily in the United States, and, as a result, we expect the impact of the reduction of the federal corporate statutory tax rate to have a positive impact on our results of operations and cash flows.  The estimated provisional repatriation toll charge of $9 million was not significant due to our limited international operations.

In addition, the trend of consolidating, converging and diversifying among our customers and payers has continued.  Consolidation is increasing price transparency and bargaining power, and encouraging internalization of clinical testing.  We also believe that PAMA may be a further catalyst for consolidation as diagnostic information services providers realize lower Medicare reimbursement rates and large diagnostic information services providers may be able to increase their share of the overall diagnostic information services industry due to their large networks and lower cost structures.

For additional information on our key trends, see "

Item 1. Business: The United States Clinical Testing Industry

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect our reported financial results and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

While many operational aspects of our business are subject to complex federal, state and local regulations, the accounting for most of our business is generally straightforward, with net revenues primarily recognized upon completion of the testing process.  Our revenues are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions, and about one-half of our total costs and expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits.  Due to the nature of our business, several of our accounting policies involve significant estimates and judgments:

•

revenues and accounts receivable associated with DIS;

•

reserves for general and professional liability claims;

•

reserves for other legal proceedings;

•

accounting for and recoverability of goodwill; and

•

accounting for stock-based compensation expense.

Revenues and accounts receivable associated with DIS

The process for estimating the ultimate collection of receivables associated with our DIS business involves significant assumptions and judgments.  We primarily recognize revenue for services rendered upon completion of the testing process.  Billings for services reimbursed by third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid, are generally recorded as revenues net of allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts from such payers.  Adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts from the third-party payers, are recorded upon settlement as an adjustment to net revenues.

We have a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectibility of our receivables based on a number of factors, including the period they have been outstanding, which results in increased allowances for doubtful accounts requirements as the aging of the related receivables increases.  Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to revenues and allowances for doubtful accounts.  Changes to the allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.  Less than 5% of our net accounts receivable as of

December 31, 2017

were outstanding more than 150 days.

We believe that the majority of our bad debt expense is primarily the result of the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility; the remainder is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions.  In addition, we regularly assess the state of our billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the



collectibility of receivables or allowance estimates.  We believe that the collectibility of our receivables is directly linked to the quality of our billing processes, most notably those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services we provide.  As such, we continue to implement “best practices” and endeavor to increase the use of electronic ordering to reduce the number of requisitions that we receive from healthcare providers with missing or incorrect billing information.  We believe that our collection and allowance estimation processes, along with our close monitoring of our billing operations, help to reduce the risk associated with material adjustments to reserve estimates.

The following table shows the approximate percentage of our total requisition volume and net revenues associated with our DIS business during


applicable to each payer group:

The following table shows net accounts receivable as of

December 31, 2017

applicable to each payer group:

Healthcare insurers

Reimbursements from healthcare insurers are based on fee-for-service schedules and on capitated payment rates.

Substantially all of the accounts receivable due from healthcare insurers represent amounts billed under fee-for-service arrangements.  Collection of such receivables is normally a function of providing complete and correct billing information to the healthcare insurers within the various filing deadlines and typically occurs within 30 to 60 days of billing.  Provided we have billed healthcare insurers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no collection risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, we determine if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and if so, we will reserve accordingly for the billing.

Approximately 4% of our DIS net revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2017

are reimbursed under capitated payment arrangements, in which case the healthcare insurers typically reimburse us in the same month services are performed, essentially giving rise to no outstanding accounts receivable at month-end.  If any capitated payments are not received on a timely basis, we determine the cause and make a separate determination as to whether or not the collection of the amount from the healthcare insurer is at risk and, if so, would reserve accordingly.

Government payers

Payments for diagnostic information services made by the government are based on fee schedules set by governmental authorities.  Collection of such receivables is normally a function of providing the complete and correct billing information within the various filing deadlines.  Collection typically occurs within 30 days of billing.  Our processes for billing, collecting and estimating uncollectible amounts for receivables due from government payers, as well as the risk of non-collection, are similar to those for healthcare insurers under fee-for-service arrangements.

Client payers



Client payers include physicians, hospitals, ACOs, IDNs, employers, other commercial laboratories and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis, and are billed based on a negotiated fee schedule.  Credit risk and ability to pay are more of a consideration for these payers than healthcare insurers and government payers.  Collection typically occurs within 60 to 90 days of billing.  In addition to our standard approach to establishing allowances for doubtful accounts, our approach to client payer receivables also focuses on specific account reviews, historical collection experience and other factors.

Patients

Patients are billed based on established patient fee schedules, subject to any limitations on fees negotiated with healthcare insurers or physicians on behalf of their patients.  Collection of receivables due from patients is subject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay.  In addition to our standard approach to establishing allowances for doubtful accounts, our approach to patient receivables also considers historical collection experience and other factors.  Patient receivables are generally fully reserved for when the related billing reaches 210 days outstanding.  Balances are automatically written off when they are sent to collection agencies.  Reserves are adjusted for estimated recoveries of amounts sent to collection agencies based on historical collection experience, which is regularly monitored.

Reserves for general and professional liability claims

As a general matter, providers of diagnostic information services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar claims.  These suits could involve claims for substantial damages.  Any professional liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation.  We maintain various liability insurance coverages for claims that could result from providing, or failing to provide, diagnostic information services, including inaccurate testing results, and other exposures.  Our insurance coverage limits our maximum exposure on individual claims; however, we are essentially self-insured for a significant portion of these claims.  While the basis for claims reserves is actuarially determined losses based upon our historical and projected loss experience, the process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to these types of claims involves a high degree of judgment.  Although we believe that our present reserves and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures, it is possible that we may incur liabilities in excess of our recorded reserves or insurance coverage.  Changes in the facts and circumstances associated with claims could have a material impact on our results of operations (principally costs of services), cash flows and financial condition in the period that reserve estimates are adjusted or paid.  See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our reserves for general and professional liability claims.

Reserves for other legal proceedings

Our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations, including inspections and audits by governmental agencies, in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business.  Although we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency would not reach a different conclusion.  Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition, these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our pricing and/or billing practices.  We have, in the past, entered into several settlement agreements with various government and private payers relating to industry-wide billing and marketing practices that had been substantially discontinued.  The federal or state governments may bring claims based on our current practices, which we believe are lawful.  In addition, certain federal and state statutes, including the

qui tam

provisions of federal and state false claims acts, allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers alleging inappropriate billing practices.  We are aware of certain pending lawsuits including class action lawsuits, and have received subpoenas related to billing practices.  See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the various legal proceedings that involve the Company.

The process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to legal proceedings involves a high degree of judgment.  Management has established reserves for legal proceedings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Changes in facts and circumstances related to such proceedings could lead to significant adjustments to reserve estimates for such matters and could have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition in the period that reserve estimates are adjusted or paid.



Accounting for and recoverability of goodwill

We do not amortize goodwill, but evaluate the recoverability and measure the potential impairment of our goodwill annually, or more frequently, in the case of other events that indicate a potential impairment.  We have identified the following reporting units for goodwill impairment testing in 2017:

•

DIS business;

•

Risk assessment services business which is part of our DS businesses

The DIS reporting unit components have been aggregated into a single reporting unit because they have similar economic characteristics, including similarities in financial performance, nature of products or services, nature of production processes and types of customers.

Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.  The annual impairment test includes an option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value; the qualitative analysis may be performed prior to, or as an alternative to, performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test.  In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we assess relevant events and circumstances, such as: (a) macroeconomic conditions; (b) industry and market considerations; (c) cost factors; (d) overall financial performance; (e) other relevant entity-specific events; (f) events affecting a reporting unit; and (g) a sustained decrease in share price.  If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we are required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  Otherwise, no further analysis is required.  Additionally, the Company's policy is to update the fair value calculation of its reporting units and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on a periodic basis.

The quantitative impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  If the carrying value is greater than our estimate of fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess.

We calculate the fair value of each reporting unit using either a discounted cash flows analysis that converts future cash flow amounts into a single discounted present value amount or a market approach.  We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation.  The discounted cash flows analysis includes several unobservable inputs related to our own assumptions.  The assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flows model are based upon the best available information in the circumstances and include a forecast of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates that are commensurate with economic risks, assumed income tax rates and estimates of capital expenditures and working capital.  The fair values of the reporting units could be different if, for example, forecasted

revenue growth rates, economic conditions, government regulations or actions by payers to control utilization of or reimbursement for healthcare services, turn out to be different than our assumptions or estimates.  Changes in the assumed discount rates due to changes in interest rates could also affect the estimated fair values of the reporting units.  We use a discount rate that considers a weighted average cost of capital plus an appropriate risk premium based upon the reporting unit being valued.  Our analysis also considers publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our Company, as well as (i) the financial projections and future prospects of our business, including its growth opportunities and likely operational improvements, and (ii) comparable sales prices, if available.  We believe our estimation methods are reasonable and reflect common valuation practices.

On a quarterly basis, we perform a review of our business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the Company and its goodwill.  If such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred, we would perform an impairment test of goodwill and record any noted impairment loss.

We perform our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.  For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, in accordance with our policy to perform the quantitative test on a periodic basis, we updated the fair value calculation of our reporting units, performed the quantitative impairment test and concluded that goodwill was not impaired.

Accounting for stock-based compensation expense

We record stock-based compensation as a charge to earnings, net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards.  As such, we recognize stock-based compensation cost only for those stock-based awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period, based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants.  The process of estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards and recognizing stock-based compensation cost over their requisite service periods involves significant assumptions and judgments.



The fair value of each stock option award granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-valuation model.  Estimating the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions regarding: (i) the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock; (ii) dividend yield; (iii) risk-free interest rates; and (iv) the period of time employees are expected to hold the award prior to exercise (referred to as the expected holding period).  Under the Black-Scholes option-valuation model, the expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of our common stock.  The dividend yield is based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and current market price of the underlying common stock at the time of grant.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities consistent with the expected holding period of the related award.  The expected holding period of the awards granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees.

We estimate the expected impact of forfeited awards and recognize stock-based compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.  We use historical experience to estimate projected forfeitures.  If actual forfeiture rates are materially different from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.  We periodically review actual forfeiture experience and adjust our estimates as necessary.  The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the change.

The terms of our performance share unit awards allow the recipients to earn a variable number of shares based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards.  Stock-based compensation expense associated with performance share units is recognized based on management's best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that will be earned.  If the actual number of performance share units earned is different from our estimates, stock-based compensation could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.  The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share units expected to be earned is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the change.  While the assumptions used to calculate and account for stock-based compensation awards represent management's best estimates, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment.  As a result, if changes are made to our assumptions and estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could vary significantly from period to period.  In addition, the number of awards made under our equity compensation plans, changes in the design of those plans, the price of our shares and the performance of our Company can all cause stock-based compensation expense to vary from period to period.

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by

2.6%

compared to the prior year.  The Focus Sale negatively impacted revenue growth by 0.3% and we estimate that hurricanes negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 0.4%.

DIS revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by

3.3%

compared to the prior year, which  reflects continuing expansion of hospital health system relationships and growth in non-routine (including advanced diagnostics)

testing.  Organic growth (growth excluding the impact of acquisitions) and acquisitions contributed approximately 2.1% and 1.2%, respectively, to DIS revenue growth.  DIS volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.3%, with organic growth and acquisitions contributing approximately 1.4% and 0.9%, respectively, to DIS volume growth.  Revenue per requisition increased by 1.0% compared to the prior year.  Revenue per requisition benefited from favorable test mix, driven in part by acquisitions, partially offset by moderate pricing pressure of less than 1% and lower revenue per requisition associated with our growth in professional lab services engagements.

Combined revenues in our DS businesses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by

10.0%

compared to the prior year primarily due to the Focus Sale.

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were

0.3%

above the prior year level.  The Clinical Trials Contribution, Focus Sale and winding down of Celera Products negatively impacted net revenues by 2.3%.

DIS revenues increased by

2.5%

for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.  Organic growth and acquisitions contributed 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively, to DIS revenue growth.  Our performance reflected continued focus on gene-based and esoteric (including advanced diagnostics) testing and expanding hospital health system relationships.  DIS



volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Organic growth and acquisitions contributed 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively, to DIS volume growth.  Revenue per requisition for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 0.4% compared to the prior year.  Revenue per requisition benefited from favorable test mix, which was partially offset by pricing pressure of approximately 0.7% and lower revenue per requisition associated with our professional lab services engagements.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, combined revenues in our DS businesses decreased by

28.5%

compared to the prior year due to the Clinical Trials Contribution, Focus Sale and winding down of Celera Products.

Cost of Services

Cost of services consists principally of costs for obtaining, transporting and testing specimens as well as facility costs used for the delivery of our services.

Cost of services increased

$103 million

for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year.  The increases were primarily driven by additional operating costs associated with our acquisitions, higher compensation and benefits expense, and higher supplies expense related to increased testing volume.

Cost of services decreased $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.  The decrease was primarily driven by lower costs as a result of the Clinical Trials Contribution, Focus Sale and winding down of Celera Products, net cost reductions under the Invigorate program, lower restructuring and integration charges and lower depreciation expense, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and higher costs related to our acquisitions.  For further details regarding the impact of the change in estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment on

depreciation expense, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A")

SG&A consist principally of the costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts, billing operations, bad debt expense and general management and administrative support as well as administrative facility costs.

SG&A increased

$69 million

for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year.  The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by higher systems conversion, integration and workforce reduction costs associated with our Invigorate program, additional operating costs associated with our acquisitions and higher performance-based compensation costs.  Bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the prior year.

SG&A increased $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.  The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits and higher bad debt expense, substantially offset by lower costs as a result of the Clinical Trials Contribution, Focus Sale and winding down of Celera Products, net cost reductions under the Invigorate program and lower depreciation expense.

The increase in bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016,

compared to the prior year, was primarily a result of our recent dispositions which had lower bad debt rates than our DIS

business.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

The

$2 million

increase in amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was associated with our acquisitions.

The $9 million decrease in amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily a result of intangible assets that became fully amortized, were disposed of as a result of the Focus Sale and the winding down of Celera Products, or were impaired.

Gain on Disposition of Business



For the year ended December 31, 2016, gain on disposition of business was a result of the Focus Sale.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, gain on disposition of business was the non-cash gain resulting from the Clinical Trials Contribution.

Other Operating Expense (Income), net

Other operating expense (income), net includes miscellaneous income and expense items and other charges related to operating activities.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, other operating expense (income), net principally consisted of a non-taxable gain on an escrow recovery associated with an acquisition, partially offset by $7 million of non-cash asset impairment charges.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, other operating expense (income), net included $24 million of non-cash asset impairment charges primarily associated with Celera Products and another subsidiary, partially offset by a gain of $13 million associated with a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with our Summit Health, Inc. acquisition.

Interest Expense, net

Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by

$8 million

compared to the prior year.  The increase in interest expense, net was primarily driven by higher interest rates associated with our variable rate indebtedness combined with higher average outstanding indebtedness.

Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $10 million compared to the prior year.  The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily a result of lower interest rates as a result of the debt refinancing in 2015 and to a lesser extent the 2016 refinancing.

Other Income (Expense), net

Other income (expense), net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to non-operating activities, such as gains and losses associated with investments, other non-operating assets and early retirement of debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, other income (expense), net included $13 million of gains associated with investments in our deferred compensation plans and a $7 million gain on the sale of an interest in an equity method investment, which are partially offset by non-cash asset impairment charges associated with certain investments of $6 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, other income (expense), net included the loss on retirement of debt of $48 million associated with the 2016 Tender Offer and non-cash asset impairment charges associated with certain investments of $7 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, other income (expense), net included the loss on retirement of debt of $144 million associated with the 2015 Tender Offer and 2015 Redemption.

Income Tax Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional estimated income tax benefit of $106 million, associated with the TCJA, including a deferred income tax benefit of $115 million primarily due to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities and reserves at the new combined federal and state tax rate, partially offset by $9 million of current tax expense primarily due to the mandatory repatriation toll charge on undistributed foreign earnings and profits.  In addition, income tax expense included

$37 million

of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, income tax expense included $84 million of income taxes associated with the Focus Sale, partially offset by

$9 million

of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements and an income tax benefit of $18 million associated with the 2016 Tender Offer.  The income tax expense associated with the Focus Sale resulted in an effective tax rate of 71.4% on the transaction, which was significantly in excess of the statutory tax rate primarily due to a lower tax basis in the assets sold, specifically the goodwill associated with the disposition.



For the year ended December 31, 2015, income tax expense included deferred income tax expense of $145 million associated with the gain on the Clinical Trials Contribution, partially offset by a $58 million deferred income tax benefit associated with winding down a subsidiary and a $57 million income tax benefit associated with the 2015 Tender Offer and 2015 Redemption.

Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively impacted by a provisional estimated $106 million benefit associated with the TCJA and

$37 million

of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements.

Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was negatively impacted by the higher tax rate, 71.4%, associated with the Focus Sale, partially offset by a non-taxable gain on an escrow recovery associated with an acquisition and

$9 million

of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements.

Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by the $58 million deferred income tax benefit associated with winding down a subsidiary, partially offset by the higher tax rate, 43.3%, associated with the gain on the Clinical Trials Contribution.

Equity in Earnings of Equity Method Investees, Net of Taxes

For the year ended December 31, 2017 there was a

$4 million

decrease in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes.

The $16 million increase in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily a result of increased earnings associated with our Q


Solutions joint venture.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We address our exposure to market risks, principally the risk of changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  We seek to mitigate the variability in cash outflows that result from changes in interest rates by maintaining a balanced mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt obligations.  In order to achieve this objective, we have entered into interest rate swaps.  Interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts.  Net settlements are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense.  We believe that our exposures to foreign exchange impacts and changes in commodity prices are not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  For further details regarding our significant accounting policies on interest rate risk and  foreign currency, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the fair value of our debt was estimated at approximately

$4.0 billion

and

$3.9 billion

, respectively, using quoted prices in active markets and yields for the same or similar types of borrowings, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.  As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the debt by

$247 million

and

$165 million

, respectively.  A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates (representing


and


basis points on average at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively) would potentially reduce the estimated fair value of our debt by approximately

$90 million

and

$102 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Borrowings under our secured receivables credit facility and our senior unsecured revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates.  Interest on our secured receivables credit facility is based on either a rate that is intended to approximate commercial paper rates for highly rated issuers or LIBOR, plus a spread.  Interest on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility is subject to a pricing schedule that can fluctuate based on changes in our credit ratings.  As such, our borrowing cost under this credit arrangement will be subject to both fluctuations in interest rates and changes in our credit ratings.  As of

December 31, 2017

, the borrowing rate under our $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility was LIBOR plus 1.125%, however there were no borrowings outstanding.  As of

December 31, 2017

, there were $30 million of outstanding borrowings under our $600 million secured receivables credit facility with a borrowing rate of 2.27%.

The notional amount of fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps as of both

December 31, 2017

and


was

$1.2 billion

. The aggregate fair value of the fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps was

$89 million

and

$88 million

, in a liability position, as of

December 31, 2017

and 2016, respectively.



Based on our net exposure to interest rate changes, a hypothetical 10% change to the variable rate component of our variable rate indebtedness (representing


basis points) would not impact annual interest expense materially, assuming no changes to the debt outstanding as of

December 31, 2017

.  A hypothetical 10% change in the forward one-month LIBOR curve (representing a


basis point change in the weighted average yield) would potentially change the fair value of our derivative liabilities by

$18 million

.

For further details regarding our outstanding debt and our financial instruments and hedging activities, see Notes 13 and 14, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.

Risk Associated with Investment Portfolio

Our investment portfolio includes equity investments comprised primarily of strategic equity holdings in privately and publicly held companies.  These securities are exposed to price fluctuations and are generally concentrated in the life sciences industry.  We regularly evaluate the fair value measurements of our equity investments to determine if losses in value are other than temporary and if an impairment loss has been incurred.  The carrying value of our equity investments (excluding investments accounted for under the equity method) was

$11 million

as of

December 31, 2017

.

We do not hedge our equity price risk.  The impact of an adverse movement in equity prices on our holdings in privately held companies cannot be easily quantified, as our ability to realize returns on investments depends on, among other things, the enterprises’ ability to raise additional capital or derive cash inflows from continuing operations or through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers or private sales.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid short-term investments.  Cash and cash equivalents as of

December 31, 2017

,


and


totaled

$137 million

,

$359 million

and

$133 million

, respectively.

As of

December 31, 2017

, approximately 37% of our

$137 million

of consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the United States. Our current liquidity position does not require repatriation of these funds in order to fund operations in the United States. However, as a result of changes introduced by the TCJA, we may repatriate back to the United States the portion of these foreign funds not expected to be used to maintain or expand operations, including through acquisitions, outside of the United States.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2017

was

$1.2 billion

, compared to

$1.1 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.  This

$106 million

increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of:

•

a decrease in 2017 tax payments associated with the realization of a $62 million deferred tax benefit in 2017 and a $91 million tax payment in 2016 related to the Focus Sale;

•

$47 million of payments made in 2016 related to the retirement of debt; and

•

improved operating performance in 2017; partially offset by

•

$54 million of proceeds received in the third quarter of 2016 from the termination of interest swap agreements.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2016

was

$1.1 billion

, compared to

$821 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

.  This

$248 million

increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of:



•

$99 million decrease in payments related to the retirement of debt, principally comprised of premiums paid, associated with the 2016 Tender Offer as compared to the 2015 Tender Offer and 2015 Redemption;

•

an additional payroll cycle in 2015;

•

$54 million of proceeds received in 2016 from the termination of interest rate swap agreements;

•

$25 million decrease in restructuring payments;

•

$24 million decrease in interest paid; and

•

improved operating performance.

These increases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $42 million increase in income taxes paid, which was driven by $91 million of income taxes paid in connection with the Focus Sale.

Days sales outstanding, a measure of billing and collection efficiency, was 45 days, 47 days and 47 days as of

December 31, 2017

,


and


, respectively.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended

December 31, 2017

was

$805 million

, compared to

$152 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.  This

$653 million

increase in cash used in investing activities was a result of:

•

$442 million increase in cash paid for business acquisitions; and

•

$269 million decrease in proceeds from the disposition of businesses, primarily a result of the Focus Sale in 2016; partially offset by

•

$41 million decrease in capital expenditures; and

•

$25 million release of escrow proceeds received in 2017 associated with the Focus Sale.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended

December 31, 2016

was

$152 million

, compared to

$362 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

.  This

$210 million

decrease in cash used in investing activities was a result of:

•

$270 million increase in proceeds from the disposition of business, principally related to the Focus Sale in 2016; and

•

$33 million decrease in investment in equity method investee, related to cash included in our Clinical Trials Contribution in 2015; partially offset by

•

$72 million increase in cash paid for business acquisitions in 2016, principally a result of the CLP acquisition in 2016; and

•

$30 million increase in capital expenditures.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended

December 31, 2017

was

$592 million

, compared to

$691 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.  This

$99 million

decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily a result of:

•

$125 million decrease in repurchases of our common stock (see "Share Repurchases" for further details) in 2017;

•

$80 million increase in bank overdrafts, which are generally settled in cash the following business day; and

•

$57 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, which was a result of an increase in the volume of stock options exercised over the past year; partially offset by

•

$23 million in net borrowings (proceeds from borrowings less repayments of debt) in 2017, compared to $145 million in net borrowings in 2016; and

•

$24 million increase in dividends paid.

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended

December 31, 2016

was

$691 million

, compared to

$518 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

.  This

$173 million

increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily a result of:

•

$366 million increase in repurchases of our common stock (discussed in "

Share Repurchases

" below); and

•

$63 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, as a result of the sale of noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to UMass Memorial Medical Center ("UMass") in 2015; partially offset by



•

$145 million in net borrowings (proceeds from borrowings less repayments of debt) in 2016, compared to $84 million in net repayments in 2015; and

•

$51 million decrease in payment of deferred acquisition consideration principally a result of a payment to UMass in 2015 related to the business acquisition in 2013.

In 2017, there were $205 million in cumulative borrowings primarily associated with the funding of the CHL and Shiel acquisitions in December 2017 and $175 million in repayments under our secured receivables credit facility.  In 2017, there were no borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

In 2016, we completed the issuance of the $500 million principal amount of 3.45% senior notes due June 2026, the 2016 Tender Offer and repaid the remaining $150 million outstanding under the Senior Notes due April 2016.  In addition, both cumulative borrowings and repayments under our secured receivables credit facility totaled $1.2 billion in 2016.  Both cumulative borrowings and repayments under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility totaled $155 million in 2016.

In 2015, we completed a $1.2 billion senior notes offering, the 2015 Tender Offer and 2015 Redemption.  In addition, both cumulative borrowings and repayments under our secured receivables credit facility totaled $1.3 billion in 2015.

For details regarding our debt and related transactions, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Dividend Program

During each of the four quarters of


and the fourth quarter of 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of

$0.45

per common share.  During each of the first three quarters of 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of

$0.40

per common share.  During each of the quarters of 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of

$0.38

per common share.  We expect to fund future dividend payments with cash flows from operations.

On January 30, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.45 to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share annually, commencing with the dividend payable on April 18, 2018.

Share Repurchases

In December 2016, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase an additional $1 billion of our common stock.

In December 2015, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase an additional

$500 million

of our common stock.  As of

December 31, 2017

,

$0.9 billion

remained available under the share repurchase authorization.

For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, we repurchased

4.6 million

shares of our common stock for

$465 million

.

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, we repurchased

7.4 million

shares of our common stock for

$590 million

, which includes 3.1 million shares repurchased under an accelerated share repurchase program.

For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, we repurchased

3.2 million

shares of our common stock for

$224 million

.

For further details regarding our share repurchases, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.



Contractual Obligations and Commitments

The following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2017

(dollars in millions):

Interest payments on our outstanding debt have been calculated after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, using the interest rates as of

December 31, 2017

applied to the

December 31, 2017

balances, which are assumed to remain outstanding through their maturity dates.

A full description of the terms of our indebtedness and related debt service requirements and our future payments under certain of our contractual obligations is contained in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.  A full discussion and analysis regarding our minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases is contained in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.  Purchase obligations include our noncancelable commitments to purchase product or services as described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.  A full discussion regarding our acquisition of Shiel

and the related merger consideration obligation is contained in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.  A full discussion regarding the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with our acquisitions is discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

As of

December 31, 2017

, our total liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits were approximately

$115 million

, which were excluded from the table above.  We expect that these liabilities may decrease by less than $35 million within the next twelve months, primarily as a result of payments, settlements, expiration of statutes of limitations and/or the conclusion of tax examinations on certain tax positions.  For the remainder, we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of the future payments of these liabilities.  Additionally, it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months, as a result of ongoing negotiations with tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitations, our total liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits will further decrease and beneficially impact the effective tax rate for continuing operations.  However, due to the inherent uncertainty of the negotiations and the resulting outcomes, we are not able to estimate the effective tax rate impact at this time.  For further details regarding the contingent tax liability reserves, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

In connection with the sale of an 18.9% noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to UMass, we granted UMass the right to require us to purchase all of its interest in the subsidiary at fair value commencing July 1, 2020.  As of

December 31, 2017

, the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet was

$80 million

, which was excluded from the table above.  Since the redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of our control, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the future payment, if any, of the redeemable noncontrolling interest.  For further details regarding the redeemable noncontrolling interest, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

Our credit agreements contain various covenants and conditions, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, that could impact our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness.  As of

December 31, 2017

, we were in compliance with the various financial covenants included in our credit agreements and we do not expect these covenants to adversely impact our ability to execute our growth strategy or conduct normal business operations.



Equity Method Investees

Our equity method investees primarily consist of our clinical trials central laboratory services joint venture and our diagnostic information services joint ventures, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  Our investment in equity method investees equals less than 5% of our consolidated total assets.  Our proportionate share of income before income taxes associated with our equity method investees equals less than 5% of our consolidated income before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity method investees.  We have no material unconditional obligations or guarantees to, or in support of, our equity method investees and their operations.  For further details regarding related party transactions with our equity method investees, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.

Requirements and Capital Resources

We estimate that we will invest approximately $350 million to $400 million during


for capital expenditures, to support and grow our existing operations, principally related to investments in information technology, laboratory equipment and facilities, including the planned start of our multi-year new laboratory construction in New Jersey, additional investments in our advanced and consumer growth strategies, as well as final buildout costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters to a lower cost location.

We expect the reduction of the federal corporate statutory tax rate under TCJA to result in tax savings and have a positive impact on our cash from operations, a portion of which we plan to reinvest back into the business and our people during 2018.  The tax savings will also offset Medicare payment reductions as a result of PAMA during 2018.

As of

December 31, 2017

, $1.2 billion of borrowing capacity was available under our existing credit facilities consisting of $499 million available under our secured receivables credit facility and $750 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.  The secured receivables credit facility includes a

$250 million

loan commitment which matures October 2018, and a

$250 million

loan commitment and a

$100 million

letter of credit facility which mature October 2019.  The senior unsecured revolving credit facility matures in April 2019.  For further details regarding the credit facilities, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

We believe the borrowing capacity under the credit facilities described above continues to be available to us.  Should one or several banks no longer participate in either of our credit facilities, we would not expect it to impact our ability to fund operations.  We expect that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities with alternative arrangements prior to their expiration.

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will provide sufficient financial flexibility to fund seasonal and other working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other obligations, cash dividends on common shares, share repurchases and additional growth opportunities for the foreseeable future.  We believe that our credit profile should provide us with access to additional financing to refinance upcoming debt maturities and, if necessary, to fund growth opportunities that cannot be funded from existing sources.

Inflation

We believe that inflation generally does not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Impact of New Accounting Standards

The impacts of recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective on our consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.



REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

“Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)”

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

is effective.

The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this annual report, audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

and issued their audit report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting included herein.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016,

and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes and financial statement schedule of valuation accounts and reserves for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 listed under Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

F- 1


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1995.

1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Background

Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and its subsidiaries ("Quest Diagnostics" or the "Company") empower people to take action to improve health outcomes.  The Company uses its extensive database of clinical lab results to derive diagnostic insights that reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management.  The Company's diagnostic information services business ("DIS") provides information and insights based on the industry-leading menu of routine, non-routine and advanced clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing, and other diagnostic information services.  The Company provides services to a broad range of customers, including patients, clinicians, hospitals, independent delivery networks ("IDNs"), health plans, employers and accountable care organizations ("ACOs").  The Company offers the broadest access in the United States to diagnostic information services through its nationwide network of laboratories, patient service centers and phlebotomists in physician offices and the Company's connectivity resources, including call centers and mobile paramedics, nurses and other health and wellness professionals.  The Company is the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services.  The Company provides interpretive consultation with one of the largest medical and scientific staffs in the industry and hundreds of M.D.s and Ph.D.s, many of whom are recognized leaders in their fields.  The Company's Diagnostic Solutions ("DS") businesses offer a variety of solutions for life insurers and healthcare organizations and clinicians.  The Company is the leading provider of risk assessment services for the life insurance industry.  In addition, the Company offers healthcare organizations and clinicians robust information technology solutions.  Prior to the sale of the Focus Diagnostics products business on May 13, 2016 (see Note 6), the Company's diagnostics products business manufactured and marketed diagnostic products.  Prior to the contribution of its clinical trials testing business to the Q


Solutions joint venture on July 1, 2015 (see Note 6), the Company's clinical trials testing business was a leading provider of central laboratory testing for clinical trials.

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by the Company through its direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting interest and the accounts of any variable interest entities ("VIEs") where the Company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities, or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns, or both.  The Company assesses the requirements related to the consolidation of VIEs, including a qualitative assessment of power and economics that considers which entity has the power to direct the activities that “most significantly impact” the VIEs' economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to, the VIE.  The Company did not have any VIEs as of both

December 31, 2017

and


.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Income attributable to the minority interest in the Company's majority owned and controlled consolidated subsidiaries is recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations and the noncontrolling interest is reflected as a separate component of consolidated stockholders' equity.

Equity Method Investments

Investments in entities which the Company does not control, but in which it has a substantial ownership interest (generally between

20%

and

49%

) and can exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  These investments are classified as investments in equity method investees in the consolidated balance sheets.  The Company records its pro rata share of the earnings, adjusted for accretion of basis difference, of these investments in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.  The Company reviews its investments in equity method investees for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

(in millions unless otherwise indicated)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

The Company primarily recognizes revenue for services rendered upon completion of the testing process.  Billings for services reimbursed by third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid, are recorded as revenues net of allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts from such payers.  Adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts from the third-party payers, are recorded upon settlement.  Billings to the Medicare and Medicaid programs were approximately

16%

,

17%

and

17%

of the Company's consolidated net revenues for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


, respectively.  Under capitated arrangements with healthcare insurers, the Company recognizes revenue based on a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member of an insurer's health plan regardless of the number or cost of services provided by the Company.

Revenues from the Company's risk assessment services, healthcare information technology, clinical trials testing (see Note 6 regarding the contribution of the clinical trials testing business to a newly formed joint venture effective July 1, 2015), and diagnostics products businesses (see Note 6 regarding the sale of the Focus Diagnostics products business on May 13, 2016) are recognized when persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price of the product or service is fixed or determinable; and collectibility from the customer is reasonably assured.

Taxes on Income

The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.  Current and deferred income taxes are measured based on the tax laws that are enacted as of the balance sheet date of the relevant reporting period.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted.  Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized only if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.

Earnings Per Share

The Company's unvested restricted stock units that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and, therefore, are included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share using the two-class method.  Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income, adjusted for earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income, adjusted for earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding after giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.  Potentially dilutive common shares include the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and performance share units granted under the Company's Amended and Restated Employee Long-Term Incentive Plan (“ELTIP”) and its Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Long-Term Incentive Plan (“DLTIP”).  Earnings allocable to participating securities include the portion of dividends declared as well as the portion of undistributed earnings during the period allocable to participating securities.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company records stock-based compensation as a charge to earnings net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards.  As such, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost

only for those stock-based awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period, based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants.  The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the change.  The terms of the Company's performance share unit awards allow the recipients of such awards to earn a variable number of shares based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards.  Stock-based compensation expense associated with performance share units is recognized based on management's best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that will be earned.  The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share units expected to be earned is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the change.  The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to the Company's Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) based on the

15%

Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines fair value measurements used in its consolidated financial statements based upon the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants exclusive of any transaction costs, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market.

Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy.  The basis for fair value measurements for each level within the hierarchy is described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar             instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.

Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.

Foreign Currency

The Company predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.  The functional currency of the Company's foreign operating subsidiaries generally is the applicable local currency.  Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates as of the end of the reporting period.  Income and expense items are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year.  Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, are included within other operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  Transaction gains and losses have historically not been material.  The Company may be exposed to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates primarily under certain intercompany receivables and payables.  From time to time, the Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of the eventual net cash inflows or outflows resulting from these intercompany transactions.  The Company's foreign exchange exposure is not material to the Company's consolidated financial condition.  The Company does not hedge its net investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries because it views those investments as long-term in nature.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all highly-liquid investments with original maturities, at the time acquired by the Company, of three months or less.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments.  The Company's policy is to place its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in highly-rated financial instruments and institutions.  Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is mitigated by the diversity of the Company's payers and their dispersion across many different geographic regions, and is limited to certain payers who are large buyers of the Company's services.  To reduce risk, the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of these payers and, consequently, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure, with respect to these payers, is limited.  While the Company has receivables due from federal and state governmental agencies, the Company does not believe that such receivables represent a credit risk since the related healthcare programs are funded by federal and state governments, and payment is primarily dependent on submitting appropriate documentation.  As of

December 31, 2017

and


, receivables due from government payers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs represent approximately

14%

and

15%

, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivable.  The portion of the Company's accounts receivable due from patients comprises the largest portion of credit risk.  As of

December 31, 2017

and


, receivables due from patients represent approximately

20%

and

17%

, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivable.  The Company applies assumptions and judgments including historical collection experience for assessing collectibility and determining allowances for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable from patients.  Refer to

New Accounting Standards To Be Adopted

within this Note 2 for impact of accounting standards update ("ASU") on revenue recognition.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded.  The Company has a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on a number of factors, including the period they have been outstanding.  Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for doubtful accounts.  In addition, the Company regularly assesses the state of its billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectibility of these receivables or reserve estimates.  Changes to the allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.  Receivables deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are written-off.  Recoveries of receivables previously written-off are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts.

Inventories

Inventories, which consist principally of testing supplies and reagents, are valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) and net realizable value.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost.  Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized for application development activities and expensed as incurred for preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities.  Capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software, payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with the internal-use software project, and interest costs incurred, when material, while developing internal-use software.  Capitalization of such costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.  Costs for maintenance and training are expensed as incurred.  The Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction period of major capital projects.  Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is amortized over the expected useful lives of the assets.  Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over expected useful asset lives as of December 31, 2017 as follows:

•

buildings and improvements, ranging up to

thirty-one and a half

years;

•

laboratory equipment and furniture and fixtures, ranging from

five

to

twelve

years;

•

leasehold improvements, the lesser of the useful life of the improvement or the remaining life of the building or lease, as applicable; and

F- 11

(in millions unless otherwise indicated)

•

computer software developed or obtained for internal use,

five

years.

In connection with the Company’s annual review of the estimated useful lives of its property, plant and equipment completed during the first quarter of 2016, the Company revised the estimated useful lives of certain classes of its property, plant and equipment.  In order to better reflect the Company's current expectations regarding the use of its assets, the recent operational improvements from its Invigorate program and considering historical and other data, the Company revised the estimated useful lives of its laboratory equipment from a range of

five

to

seven

years to a range of

seven

to

ten

years, furniture and fixtures from a range of

three

to

seven

years to a range of

five

to

twelve

years and computer software obtained for internal use from

three

years to

five

years.  The change in estimated useful lives was accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate effective in the first quarter of 2016.  The impact of this change for the year ended December 31, 2016, was a decrease in depreciation expense and an increase in operating income of

$37 million

and an increase in net income of

$23 million

, or

$0.16

per share on a basic and diluted basis.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the acquiree (including the fair value of non-controlling interests) over the recognized bases of the net identifiable assets acquired and includes the future economic benefits from other assets that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.  Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically reviewed for impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of goodwill is more than its fair value.

The goodwill test is performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.  The annual impairment test includes an option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value; the qualitative test may be performed prior to, or as an alternative to, performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test.  If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company is required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  Otherwise, no further analysis is required.  Additionally, the Company's policy is to update the fair value calculation of its reporting units and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on a periodic basis.

The quantitative impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  The Company calculates the fair value of each reporting unit using either a discounted cash flows analysis that converts future cash flow amounts into a single discounted present value amount or a market approach.  The Company assesses the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time that the valuation is performed.  The Company compares the estimate of fair value for the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit.  If the carrying value is greater than the estimate of fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess.

On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the Company and its goodwill.  If such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred, the Company would perform an impairment test of goodwill as of the end of the quarter and record any noted impairment loss.

The Company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.  For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, in accordance with its policy to perform the quantitative test on a periodic basis, the Company updated the fair value calculation of its reporting units, performed the quantitative impairment test and concluded that goodwill was not impaired.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company performed the qualitative impairment test.  Based on the totality of information available for the DIS and risk assessment services reporting units, the Company concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair values were greater than the carrying values of the reporting units, and as such, no further analysis was required.

(in millions unless otherwise indicated)

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are recognized at fair value, as an asset apart from goodwill if the asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or if it is separable.  Intangible assets, principally representing the cost of customer-related intangibles, non-competition agreements and technology acquired, are capitalized and amortized on the straight-line method over their expected useful life, which generally ranges from

five

to

twenty

years.  Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, consisting principally of acquired tradenames, are not amortized, but instead are periodically reviewed for impairment.

The Company reviews indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically for impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of indefinite-lived intangibles is more than its estimated fair value.  The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test is performed at least annually, or more frequently in the case of other events that indicate a potential impairment.

Based upon the Company’s most recent annual impairment tests completed during the fourth quarter of the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


, the Company concluded that indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.

The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets (including amortizable intangible assets), other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.  Evaluation of possible impairment is based on the Company's ability to recover the asset from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations.  If the expected undiscounted pre-tax cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying amount of the asset.

Investments

The Company's investments, which are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, are comprised of trading securities, available-for-sale securities and other investments.  The classification of an investment depends on the Company's intent and ability to hold the investment.

•

Trading securities represent participant-directed investments of deferred employee compensation and related Company matching contributions held in trusts pursuant to the Company's supplemental deferred compensation plans (see Note 16).  Trading securities are carried at fair value with both realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings as a component of non-operating expenses within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  For the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


, gains from trading equity securities totaled

$8 million

,

$3 million

, and

$0 million

, respectively.

•

Available-for-sale equity securities consists of an investment in registered shares of a public corporation.  Available-for-sale equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity and realized gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company had gross unrealized gains from available-for-sale equity securities of

$0 million

.

•

Other investments do not have readily determinable fair values and consist of investments in preferred and common shares of privately held companies and are accounted for under the cost method.

Gains and losses on securities sold are based on the average cost method.  The Company periodically reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other-than-temporary.  The primary factors considered in the determination are: the length of time that the fair value of the investment is below carrying value; the financial condition, operating performance and near-term prospects of the investee; and the Company's intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value.  If the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of

$6 million

in other income (expense), net related to its available-for-sale equity investment.

Investments as of

December 31, 2017

and


consisted of the following:

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates and, from time to time, foreign currencies.  This strategy includes the use of interest rate swap agreements, forward starting interest rate swap agreements, treasury lock agreements and foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exposure to movements in interest and currency rates.  The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities.  These policies prohibit holding or issuing derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments that contain credit-risk-related contingent features or requirements to post collateral.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and cash equivalents and its debt obligations.  Interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents may fluctuate as interest rates change; however, due to their relatively short maturities, the Company does not hedge these assets or their investment cash flows and the impact of interest rate risk is not material.  The Company's debt obligations consist of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt instruments.  The Company's primary objective is to achieve the lowest overall cost of funding while managing the variability in cash outflows within an acceptable range.  In order to achieve this objective, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps.  Interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts.  Net settlements between the counterparties are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense, net.

The Company accounts for these derivatives as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value.  The fair value is based upon model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets and includes an adjustment for the credit risk of the obligor's non-performance.  For a derivative instrument that has been formally designated as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the derivative instrument along with offsetting fair value gains or losses on the hedged item that are attributable to the risk being hedged are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  For derivatives that have been formally designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Upon maturity or early termination of an effective interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge, unrealized gains or losses are deferred in stockholders' equity, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings, which is when the Company recognizes interest expense on the hedged cash flows.  At inception and quarterly thereafter, the Company formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.  After the initial quantitative assessment,  this analysis is performed on a qualitative basis and, if it is determined that the hedging relationship was and continues to be highly effective, no further analysis is required.  All components of each derivative financial instrument's gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses related to a discontinued cash flow hedge shall continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss, unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur.  If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the originally specified time period, the Company discontinues hedge accounting, and any deferred gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss are classified into earnings immediately.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) encompasses all changes in stockholders' equity (except those arising from transactions with stockholders) and includes:

•

Foreign currency translation adjustments;

F- 14


QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

(in millions unless otherwise indicated)

•

Investment adjustments, which represent unrealized holding gains (losses), net of tax on available for sale securities, net of other-than-temporary impairment amounts reclassified to other income (expense), net; and

•

Net deferred loss on cash flow hedges, which represents deferred losses, net of tax on interest rate related derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges, net of amounts reclassified to interest expense (see Note 15).

New Accounting Standards

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

On January 1, 2017, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") that simplifies the transition to the equity method of accounting by requiring adoption as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting.  Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company adopted a new accounting standard that simplifies the quantitative test for goodwill impairment.  The guidance eliminates step two in the current two-step process so that any goodwill impairment is measured as the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value.  The adoption of this standard, which was done on a prospective basis, did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In the third quarter of 2017, the Company elected to early adopt a new accounting standard, effective January 1, 2017, that amends and simplifies existing hedge accounting guidance and allows for more hedging strategies to be eligible for hedge accounting.  In addition, the new standard amends disclosure requirements and how hedge effectiveness is assessed. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  For further details regarding the Company's derivative financial instruments, see Note 14.

New Accounting Standards To Be Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU on revenue recognition.  This ASU outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.  This standard supersedes existing revenue recognition requirements and eliminates most industry-specific guidance from GAAP.  The core principle of the revenue recognition standard is to require an entity to recognize as revenue the amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services as it transfers control to its customers.  In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of this ASU to the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2017.  The ASU can be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method of adoption.  The Company will adopt the ASU in the first quarter of 2018 using the full retrospective method.  The Company continues to assess the impact of this ASU on its results of operations, financial position, cash flows and disclosures. Based on the Company's assessment of this ASU, the majority of the amounts that were historically classified as bad debt expense, primarily related to patient responsibility, will be considered an implicit price concession in determining net revenues.  Accordingly, the Company will report uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction of the transaction price and therefore as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.  As a result of this change, the Company preliminarily estimates the following impact to its consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

F- 15


QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED

(in millions unless otherwise indicated)

In addition, the adoption of this ASU will result in increased disclosure, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  However, the adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or cash flows.

In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities.  This ASU requires that all equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  However, companies may elect to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.  In addition, the ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet.  The ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that amends accounting for leases.  Under the new guidance, a lessee will recognize assets and liabilities for most leases on its balance sheet but will recognize expense on its consolidated statement of operations similar to current lease accounting.  The ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted.  The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach.  The adoption of this ASU will result in a significant increase to the Company’s balance sheet for lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, which has not yet been quantified.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  Significant implementation

matters being addressed by the Company include implementing an integrated third-party lease accounting application, assessing the impact to its internal controls over financial reporting and documenting the new lease accounting process.

In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including trade receivables, from an incurred loss method to a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses.  The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  This ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020 and must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

In August 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018 and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.  Upon adoption cash payments for debt retirement costs (which were

$47 million

in 2016) would be reclassified from operating cash outflows to financing cash outflows in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  The future impact of the adoption of this ASU on the Company's cash flows will be dependent upon the nature of any future debt refinancing transactions.

In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that clarifies the presentation and classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows.  The ASU requires that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be presented with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.  The ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018 and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its cash flows.

F- 16

(in millions unless otherwise indicated)

In January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU that provides guidance on evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities (set) is a business.  If an entity determines that substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, then the asset is not a business.  If this threshold is not met, then the entity needs to evaluate whether the asset includes, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.  The ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018 and must be applied prospectively.  The future impact of the adoption of this ASU on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be dependent upon the nature of any future acquisitions or dispositions made by the Company.

4.    RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES

Invigorate Program

During 2012, the Company committed to a course of action related to a multi-year program called Invigorate which is designed to reduce its cost structure and improve performance.  Invigorate has consisted of several flagship programs, with structured plans in each, to drive savings and improve performance across the customer value chain.  These flagship programs include: organization excellence; information technology excellence; procurement excellence; service excellence; lab excellence; and billing excellence.  From 2012 through 2014, the Invigorate program was intended to partially offset reimbursement pressures and labor and benefit cost increases; free up additional resources to invest in science, innovation and other growth initiatives; and enable us to improve service quality and operating profitability.

In January 2015, the Company adopted a program to further reduce its cost structure through 2017.  This multi-year program continued to focus on the flagship program themes and additional key themes such as: standardizing processes, information technology systems, equipment and data; enhancing electronic enabling services; and enhancing reimbursement for work performed.

General    Information

The acquisitions described above were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.  As such, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their estimated fair values as of the closing date.  Supplemental pro forma combined financial information has not been presented as the impact of the acquisitions is not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.  The goodwill recorded primarily includes the expected synergies resulting from combining the operations of the acquired entities with those of the Company and the value associated with an assembled workforce and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.  All of the goodwill acquired in connection with these acquisitions, except for that associated with Superior Mobile Medics, has been allocated to the Company's DIS business.  Goodwill acquired in connection with Superior Mobile Medics has been allocated to the Company's risk assessment business.  For further details regarding business segment information, see Note 18.

6.    DISPOSITIONS

Sale of Focus Diagnostics Products

On March 29, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the assets of its non-core Focus Diagnostics products business ("Focus Diagnostics") to DiaSorin S.p.A. ("DiaSorin").  On May 13, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Focus Diagnostics for

$300 million

in cash, or

$293 million

net of transaction costs and working capital adjustments, which included

$25 million

of proceeds which were initially held in escrow and received in 2017.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a

$118 million

pre-tax gain on disposition of business.  The Company also recorded income tax expense of

$84 million

, consisting of

$91 million

of current income tax expense (all of which was paid in 2016) and a deferred income tax benefit of

$7 million

.  The income tax expense resulted in an effective tax rate of

71.4%

, which was significantly in excess of the statutory tax rate primarily due to a lower tax basis in the assets sold, specifically the goodwill associated with the disposition.

The assets disposed of consisted of

$113 million

of goodwill,

$30 million

of intangible assets, with the remaining

$38 million

consisting of accounts receivable, inventories and property, plant and equipment.  In addition, the disposition included liabilities of

$6 million

.

In connection with the sale, the Company entered into a

five

year supply agreement with DiaSorin.  The supply agreement, which does not include a minimum purchase commitment, enables the Company to purchase certain products and supplies used in its DIS business.

Focus Diagnostics, prior to May 13, 2016, was included in all other operating segments and has not been classified as a discontinued operation.  For further details regarding business segment information, see Note 18.

Contribution of Clinical Trials Business

On March 30, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Quintiles Transnational Holdings, Inc. (now known as IQVIA Holdings Inc.) to form a global clinical trials central laboratory services joint venture, Q


Solutions.  The transaction closed on July 1, 2015.  In connection with the transaction, the Company contributed certain assets of its clinical trials testing business ("Clinical Trials") and

$33 million

of cash to the newly formed joint venture in exchange for a non-controlling,

40%

ownership interest.  The assets of Clinical Trials contributed to the joint venture, principally consisting of property, plant and equipment and goodwill, were classified as assets held for sale in the first quarter of 2015 and were contributed to Q


Solutions upon closing of the transaction.  Subsequent to closing, the Company's ownership interest in the joint venture is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the investment in Q


Solutions had a carrying value of

$406 million

and

$389 million

, respectively.

During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of

$334 million

based on the difference between the fair value of the Company's equity interest in the newly formed joint venture over the carrying value of the assets contributed.  The fair value of the Company's equity interest was determined using discounted cash flows.  The most significant assumptions used in the valuation include a discount rate (

12%

), a long-term growth rate (

2.5%

) and EBITDA margins.  In connection with the gain, the Company recorded a deferred income tax liability of

$145 million

.  Upon formation, the Company's investment in Q


Solutions exceeded its equity in the underlying net assets by approximately

$219 million

.  This basis difference is attributable to finite-lived assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill of the joint venture.  The basis difference associated with the finite-lived assets of

$75 million

is being amortized over a weighted average useful life of


years as a reduction to the carrying value of the investment in equity method investees and corresponding reduction in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes.

Q


Solutions is considered a related party to the Company due to the Company's non-controlling ownership interest in Q


Solutions and the Company's continuing involvement in providing diagnostic information services on an ongoing basis.  In addition, the Company provides transition services to Q


Solutions for a limited period of time.  For further details regarding related parties, see Note 19.

Clinical Trials, prior to July 1, 2015, was included in all other operating segments and has not been classified as discontinued operations.  For further details regarding business segment information, see Note 18.

7.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The following table provides a summary of the recognized assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The Company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in non-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plans.  A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are invested in a variety of participant-directed stock and bond mutual funds that are classified as trading securities.  The trading securities are classified within Level 1 because the changes in the fair value of these securities are measured using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, exclusive of any transaction costs.  A corresponding adjustment for changes in fair value of the trading securities is also reflected in the changes in fair value of the deferred compensation obligation.  The deferred compensation liabilities are classified within Level 2 because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the trading securities.

The Company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a non-qualified deferred compensation program.  A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are “invested” at the direction of the employee in a hypothetical portfolio of investments which are tracked by an administrator.  The Company purchases life insurance policies, with the Company named as beneficiary of the policies, for the purpose of funding the program's liability.  Changes in the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies are based upon earnings and changes in the value of the underlying investments.  Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation obligation are derived using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units.  The cash surrender value and the deferred compensation obligations are classified within Level 2 because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the hypothetical investments.  This plan was amended effective January 1, 2018 so that future deferrals under the plan may only be made by participants who made deferrals under the plan in 2017.

The fair value measurements of the Company's interest rate swaps classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy  are model-derived valuations as of a given date in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets including certain financial information and certain assumptions regarding past, present and future market conditions.

Investment in available-for-sale equity securities represents an investment in registered shares of a publicly-held company.  The Company's investment in available-for-sale equity securities is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value is obtained from quoted prices in an active market.

In April 2014, the Company completed the acquisitions of Summit Health, Inc. ("Summit Health"), a provider of on-site prevention and wellness programs, and Steward Health Care Systems, LLC's ("Steward") laboratory outreach business.  In connection with these acquisitions the Company initially recorded an aggregate contingent consideration liability of

$26 million

.  The contingent consideration liability was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy measured at fair value using a probability weighted and discounted cash flow method.  These measurements are based on externally obtained inputs and management's probability assessments of the occurrence of triggering events, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated with the obligations, as well as the likelihood of achieving financial targets.  The initial probability estimate of the occurrence of such triggering events associated with the amounts the Company could be obligated to pay in future periods for both Summit Health and Steward was between

5%

and

95%

.  The probability-weighted cash flows were then discounted using a discount rate of

1.5%

to

2.8%

.  Based on actual 2015 results for Summit Health compared to the earn-out target included in the contingent consideration arrangement, no payment was required. Therefore, the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with Summit Health was reduced to

$0

in the second quarter of 2015, which resulted in a

$13 million

gain included in other operating expense (income), net for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The remaining contingent consideration associated with Steward of

$1 million

is expected to be paid in 2018.

In December 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Shiel which provides for up to

$15 million

of contingent consideration to be paid based on the achievement of certain testing volume benchmarks.  In connection with the acquisition, the Company initially recorded a contingent consideration liability of

$6 million

which was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  The contingent consideration was measured at fair value using an option-pricing model.  Significant inputs included management's estimate of volume and other market inputs including comparable company revenue volatility of

6.9%

and a discount rate of

4.5%

.  Any contingent consideration associated with Shiel is expected to be paid in 2018.  For further details regarding the Shiel acquisition, see Note 5.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of liabilities using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short maturities of these instruments.  As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the fair value of the Company's debt was estimated at

$4.0 billion

and

$3.9 billion

, respectively.  Principally all of the Company's debt is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value of the debt is estimated based on rates currently offered to the Company with identical terms and maturities, using quoted active market prices and yields, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.

8.    TAXES ON INCOME

The Company's pre-tax income before equity in earnings of equity method investees consisted of approximately

$1.0 billion

,

$1.1 billion

and

$1.1 billion

from U.S. operations and a pre-tax (loss) income of

$(7) million

,

$4 million

and

$11 million

from foreign operations for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


, respectively.

The Company recognized the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") in its 2017 consolidated financial statements in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides Securities and Exchange Commission staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740,

Income Taxes

, in the reporting period in which the TCJA was signed into law.  As such, the Company’s financial results reflect the provisional estimate of the income tax effects of the TCJA. The estimate of the impact of TCJA is based on certain assumptions and the Company's current interpretation, and may change, as the Company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance and as the interpretation of the TCJA evolves over time.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional estimated income tax benefit of

$106 million

associated with the TCJA, including a deferred income tax benefit of

$115 million

primarily due to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities and reserves at the new combined federal and state tax rate, partially offset by

$9 million

of current tax expense primarily due to the mandatory repatriation toll charge on undistributed foreign earnings and profits.  The Company did not identify items for which the income tax effects of the TCJA have not been completed and a reasonable estimate could not be determined as of December 31, 2017.

As a result of the TCJA, the Company changed its assertion that it intends to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries outside the U.S.  The Company is indefinitely reinvested in the remaining basis difference and it is not practicable to determine the associated amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded

$84 million

of income tax expense, consisting of

$91 million

of current income tax expense and a deferred income tax benefit of

$7 million

, associated with the sale of Focus Diagnostics (see Note 6).  In addition, the Company recognized a non-taxable gain on an escrow recovery associated with an acquisition.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized

$145 million

of deferred income tax expense associated with the financial reporting and tax basis difference resulting from the contribution of the Clinical Trials business to the Q


Solutions joint venture and

$58 million

of deferred income tax benefit resulting from the future tax effects of winding down a subsidiary.

(in millions unless otherwise indicated)

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of and for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


consisted of the following:

The contingent liabilities for tax positions primarily relate to uncertainties associated with the realization of tax benefits derived from the allocation of income and expense among state jurisdictions, the characterization and timing of certain tax deductions associated with business combinations, income and expenses associated with certain intercompany licensing arrangements, certain tax credits and the deductibility of certain settlement payments.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of

December 31, 2017

, that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate is

$64 million

.  Based upon the expiration of statutes of limitations, settlements and/or the conclusion of tax examinations, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to

$35 million

within the next twelve months.

Accruals for interest expense on contingent tax liabilities are classified in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.  Accruals for penalties have historically been immaterial.  Interest expense included in income tax expense in each of the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


was approximately

$1 million

,

$2 million

and

$0 million

, respectively.  As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the Company has approximately

$13 million

and

$12 million

, respectively, accrued, net of the benefit of a federal and state deduction, for the payment of interest on uncertain tax positions.

The recognition and measurement of certain tax benefits includes estimates and judgment by management and inherently involves subjectivity.  Changes in estimates may create volatility in the Company's effective tax rate in future periods and may be due to settlements with various tax authorities (either favorable or unfavorable), the expiration of the statute of limitations on some tax positions and obtaining new information about particular tax positions that may cause management to change its estimates.

In the regular course of business, various federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities conduct examinations of the Company's income tax filings and the Company generally remains subject to examination until the statute of limitations expires for the respective jurisdiction.  The Internal Revenue Service has either completed its examinations of the Company's consolidated federal income tax returns or the statute of limitations has expired up through and including the


tax year pending Joint Committee of Congress approval of refund for settlement of certain tax adjustments related to the


tax year.  At this time, the Company does not believe that there will be any material additional payments beyond its recorded contingent liability reserves that may be required as a result of these tax audits.  As of

December 31, 2017

, a summary of the tax years that remain subject to examination, awaiting approval, are under appeal, or are otherwise unresolved for the Company's major jurisdictions are:

Secured Receivables Credit Facility

On October 27, 2017, the Company amended and restated the agreement for the $

600 million

secured receivables credit facility (the “Secured Receivables Credit Facility”) previously amended in October 2015, maintaining the borrowing capacity under the facility at

$600 million

.  Under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility, the Company can borrow against a

$250 million

loan commitment maturing October 2018, and a

$250 million

loan commitment maturing October 2019, and can issue up to

$100 million

of letters of credit (see Note 17) through October 2019.  Borrowings under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility are collateralized by certain domestic receivables.  As of

December 31, 2017

, interest on the borrowings under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility is based on either commercial paper rates for highly-rated issuers or LIBOR plus a spread of

0.70%

to

0.725%

.  The Secured Receivables Credit Facility contains various covenants which could impact the Company's ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2017, there was

$30 million

of outstanding borrowings under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility.  As of December 31,


, there were

no

outstanding borrowings under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility.

Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

In April 2014, the Company amended and restated the agreement for the $

750 million

senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility” or "Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility") entered into in September 2011.  The amended and restated Credit Facility matures in April 2019.  Under the Credit Facility, the Company can issue letters of credit totaling $

150 million

(see Note 17).  Issued letters of credit reduce the available borrowing capacity under the facility.  Interest on the Credit Facility is based on certain published rates plus an applicable margin that will vary over a range from


basis points to


basis points based on changes in the Company's public debt ratings.  At the option of the Company, it may elect to lock into LIBOR-based interest rates for periods up to six months.  Interest on any outstanding amounts not covered under LIBOR-based interest rate contracts is based on an alternate base rate, which is calculated by reference to the prime rate, the federal funds rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate.  As of both

$4 million

of costs associated with the 2016 Senior Notes, which is included as a reduction to the carrying amount of long-term debt and is being amortized over the term of the related debt.  The net proceeds from the 2016 Senior Notes were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and the Secured Receivables Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes.

In March 2015, the Company completed a

$1.2 billion

senior notes offering (the “2015 Senior Notes”) that was sold in three tranches: (a)

$300 million

aggregate principal amount of

Interest Rate Derivatives – Cash Flow Hedges

From time to time, the Company has entered into various interest rate lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge part of the Company's interest rate exposure associated with the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates.

In May 2016, the Company entered into interest rate lock agreements with several financial institutions for a total notional amount of

$250 million

which were accounted for as cash flow hedges.  These agreements were entered into to hedge a portion of the Company’s interest rate exposure associated with variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the ten-year treasury rates related to the planned issuance of the 2016 Senior Notes.  In connection with the issuance of the 2016  Senior Notes, these agreements were settled, and the Company paid

$1 million

.  These losses are deferred in stockholders’ equity, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense, net over the term of the respective senior notes.

In March 2015, the Company entered into interest rate lock agreements with several financial institutions for a total notional amount of

$350 million

which were accounted for as cash flow hedges.  These agreements were entered into to hedge a portion of the Company’s interest rate exposure associated with variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the five-year, ten-year and thirty-year treasury rates related to the planned issuance of the 2015 Senior Notes.  In connection with the issuance of the 2015 Senior Notes, these agreements were settled and the Company received

$3 million

.  These gains are deferred in stockholders’ equity, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense, net over the term of the respective senior notes.

During the fourth quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014, the Company entered into various forward starting interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of

$150 million

which were accounted for as cash flow hedges.  In connection with the issuance of the 2015 Senior Notes, all of these agreements were settled and the Company paid

$17 million

.  These losses are deferred in stockholders’ equity, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense, net over the term of the senior notes due 2025.

The total net loss, net of taxes, recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, related to the Company's cash flow hedges as of

December 31, 2017

and


was

$9 million

and

$10 million

, respectively.  The net amount of deferred losses on cash flow hedges that is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense, net within the next twelve months is

$3 million

.

Interest Rate Derivatives – Fair Value Hedges

The Company maintains various fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps to convert a portion of the Company's long-term debt into variable interest rate debt.  A summary of the notional amounts of these interest rate swaps as of

December 31, 2017

and


was as follows:

The fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in the table above have variable interest rates ranging from one-month LIBOR plus

2.2%

to one-month LIBOR plus

3.0%

.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had entered into various fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of

$1.2 billion

.  In July 2016, the Company terminated those interest rate swaps agreements.  As a result of the termination, the Company received proceeds of

$60 million

, which included

$6 million

of accrued interest.  The

F- 32

remaining basis adjustment on the respective debt obligation of

$54 million

will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining terms of the hedged debt instrument.  Immediately after the termination of these interest rate swaps, the Company entered into new fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements, which are reflected in the table above.

In prior years, the Company entered into various fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements that were accounted for as fair value hedges of a portion of the senior notes due 2016 and a portion of the senior notes due 2020.  In July 2012, the Company monetized the value of these interest rate swap assets by terminating the hedging instruments.  The asset value, including accrued interest through the date of termination, was

$72 million

and the amount to be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining terms of the hedged debt instruments was

$65 million

.

As of

December 31, 2017

, the following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges:

(a) The balance includes

$56 million

of remaining unamortized hedging adjustment on a discontinued relationship.

Interest Rate Derivatives - Economic Hedges

In March 2016, in connection with the retirement of debt (see Note 13), the Company entered into reverse interest rate lock agreements with several financial institutions which were not designated for hedge accounting.  The Company entered into these agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with

$75 million

of the

$200 million

principal amount of debt that was retired in the first quarter of 2016.  These agreements were settled during the first quarter of 2016 resulting in a gain of

which was recognized in other income (expense), net.

In March 2015, in connection with the retirement of debt (see Note 13), the Company entered into reverse interest rate lock agreements with several financial institutions which were not designated for hedge accounting.  The Company entered into these agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with

of the

$1.3 billion

principal amount of debt that was retired in the first and second quarters of 2015.  These agreements were settled during the first and second quarters of 2015 which resulted in a gain of

In May 2016, the Company entered into an ASR with a financial institution to repurchase

of the Company's common stock as part of the Company's share repurchase program.  The ASR was structured as a combination of two transactions: (1) a treasury stock repurchase; and (2) a forward contract, which permitted the Company to purchase shares immediately with the final purchase price of those shares determined by the volume weighted average price of the Company's common stock during the repurchase period, less a fixed discount.

$68 million

.  Under the terms of the transaction, UMass has the right to require the Company to purchase all of its interest in the subsidiary at fair value commencing July 1, 2020.  Since the redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of the Company's control, it has been presented outside of stockholders' equity at the greater of its carrying amount or its fair value.  The Company records changes in the fair value of the noncontrolling interest immediately as they occur.  As of

16.    STOCK OWNERSHIP AND COMPENSATION PLANS

Employee and Non-employee Directors Stock Ownership Programs

In 2005, the Company established the ELTIP to replace the Company's prior plan.  The ELTIP provides for three types of awards: (a) stock options, (b) stock appreciation rights and (c) stock awards.  The ELTIP provides for the grant to eligible employees of either non-qualified or incentive stock options, or both, to purchase shares of Company common stock at an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Grants of stock appreciation rights allow eligible employees to receive a payment based on the appreciation of Company common stock in cash, shares of Company common stock or a combination thereof.  The stock appreciation rights are granted at an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the ELTIP expire on the date designated by the Board of Directors but in no event more than

ten

years from date of grant.  No stock appreciation rights have been granted under the ELTIP.  The stock options and shares are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the end of the vesting period prescribed by the Board of Directors.  For all award types, the vesting period is generally over

three

years from the date of grant.  For performance share unit awards, the actual amount of shares earned is based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards.  The maximum number of shares of Company common stock that may be optioned or granted under the ELTIP is approximately

71 million

shares.

F- 36


QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

(in millions unless otherwise indicated)

In 2005, the Company established the DLTIP to replace the Company's prior plan.  The DLTIP provides for the grant to non-employee directors of non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Company common stock at an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  The DLTIP also permits awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units to non-employee directors.  Stock options granted under the DLTIP expire on the date designated by the Board of Directors but in no event more than

ten

years from date of grant, and generally become exercisable in

three

equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary date of the grant of the option regardless of whether the optionee remains a director of the Company.  The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the DLTIP is

2.4 million

shares.  For the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


, grants under the DLTIP totaled

13 thousand

shares,

21 thousand

shares and

31 thousand

shares, respectively.

The Company's practice has been to issue shares related to its stock-based compensation program from shares of its common stock held in treasury or by issuing new shares of its common stock.  See Note 15 for further information regarding the Company's share repurchase program.

The fair value of each stock option award granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-valuation model.  The expected volatility under the Black-Scholes option-valuation model was based on historical volatilities of the Company's common stock.  The dividend yield was based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and current market price of the underlying common stock at the time of grant.  The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities consistent with the expected holding period of the related award.  The expected holding period was estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees.

The weighted average assumptions used in valuing stock options granted in the periods presented were:

The fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance share units is the average market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant.

The following summarizes the activity relative to stock option awards for


:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company's closing common stock price on the last trading day of


and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on

Supplemental Deferred Compensation Plans

The Company has a supplemental deferred compensation plan that is an unfunded, non-qualified plan that provides for certain management and highly compensated employees to defer up to

50%

of their salary in excess of their defined contribution plan limits and for certain eligible employees, up to

95%

of their variable incentive compensation.  The maximum Company matching contribution is

5%

of eligible employee compensation.  The compensation deferred under this plan, together with Company matching amounts, are credited with earnings or losses measured by the mirrored rate of return on investments elected by plan participants.  Each plan participant is fully vested in all deferred compensation, Company match and earnings credited to their account.  The amounts accrued under the Company's deferred compensation plans were

$58 million

and

$51 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.  Although the Company is currently contributing all participant deferrals and matching amounts to trusts, the funds in these trusts, totaling

$58 million

and

$51 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, are general assets of the Company and are subject to any claims of the Company's creditors.

The Company also offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a non-qualified deferred compensation program.  Eligible participants are allowed to defer up to

$20 thousand

of eligible compensation per year.  The Company matches employee contributions equal to

25%

, up to a maximum of

$5 thousand

per plan year.  A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are “invested” at the direction of the employee in a hypothetical portfolio of investments which are tracked by an administrator.  Each participant is fully vested in their deferred compensation and vests in Company matching contributions over a

four

-year period at

25%

per year.  This plan was amended effective January 1, 2018 so that future deferrals under the plan may only be made by participants who made deferrals under the plan in 2017.  The amounts accrued under this plan were

$45 million

and

$39 million

as of

December 31, 2017

Billing and Collection Agreement

In September 2016, the Company entered into a

ten

year agreement with a third party to outsource its billing and  related operations for the majority of the Company’s revenues.  Services under the agreement commenced during the fourth quarter of 2016.  The agreement includes an annual fee, which is subject to adjustment based on certain changes in the Company's requisition volume and the achievement of various performance metrics.

Contingent Lease Obligations

The Company remains subject to contingent obligations under certain real estate leases, including real estate leases that were entered into by certain predecessor companies of a subsidiary prior to the Company's acquisition of the subsidiary.  While over the course of many years, the title to certain properties and interest in the subject leases have been transferred to third parties and the subject leases have been amended several times by such third parties, the lessors have not formally released the subsidiary predecessor companies from their original obligations under the leases and therefore remain contingently liable in the event of default.  The remaining terms of the lease obligations and the Company's corresponding indemnifications range up to


years.  The lease payments under certain leases are subject to market value adjustments and contingent rental payments and therefore, the total contingent obligations under the leases cannot be precisely determined but are likely to total several hundred million dollars.  A claim against the Company would be made only upon the current lessee's default and, in certain cases, after a series of claims and corresponding defaults by third parties that precede the Company in the order of liability.  The Company also has certain indemnification rights from other parties to recover losses in the event of default on the lease obligations.  The Company believes that the likelihood of its performance under these contingent obligations is remote and no liability has been recorded for any potential payments under the contingent lease obligations.

Legal Matters

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings.  Some of the proceedings against the Company involve claims that could be substantial in amount.

In the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with the Company's activities as a provider of diagnostic testing, information and services.  These legal actions may include lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims.  These actions could involve claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages, and could have an adverse impact on the Company's client base and reputation.

The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings by governmental agencies regarding the Company's business, including, among other matters, operational matters, which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.  The number of these reviews, investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the healthcare services industry, including the Company.

The federal or state governments may bring claims based on the Company's current practices, which it believes are lawful.  In addition, certain federal and state statutes, including the

qui tam

provisions of the federal False Claims Act, allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers.  The Company is aware of lawsuits, and from time to time has received subpoenas, related to billing practices based on the qui tam provisions of the Civil False Claims Act or other federal and state statutes, regulations or other laws.  The Company understands that there may be other pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other "whistle blowers" as to which the Company cannot determine the extent of any potential liability.

Management cannot predict the outcome of such matters.  Although management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, given the high degree of

F- 40


QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED

(in millions unless otherwise indicated)

judgment involved in establishing loss estimates related to these types of matters, the outcome of such matters may be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid.

These matters are in different stages.  Some of these matters are in their early stages.  Matters may involve responding to and cooperating with various government investigations and related subpoenas.  As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company does not believe that any material losses related to the legal matters described above are probable.

Reserves for Legal Matters

Reserves for legal matters totaled

$2 million

and

$5 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Reserves for General and Professional Liability Claims

As a general matter, providers of clinical testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims.  These suits could involve claims for substantial damages.  Any professional liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on the Company's client base and reputation.  The Company maintains various liability insurance coverages for, among other things, claims that could result from providing, or failing to provide, clinical testing services, including inaccurate testing results, and other exposures.  The Company's insurance coverage limits its maximum exposure on individual claims; however, the Company is essentially self-insured for a significant portion of these claims.  Reserves for such  matters, including those associated with both asserted and incurred but not reported claims, are established on an undiscounted basis by considering actuarially determined losses based upon the Company's historical and projected loss experience.  Such reserves totaled

$118 million

and

$117 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.  Management believes that established reserves and present insurance coverage are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures.  Management cannot predict the outcome of any claims made against the Company.  Although management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, given the high degree of judgment involved in establishing accruals for loss estimates related to these types of matters, the outcome may be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such claims is determined or paid.

18.    BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company's DIS business is the only reportable segment based on the manner in which the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), assesses performance and allocates resources across the organization.  The DIS business provides diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers, including patients, clinicians, hospitals, IDNs, health plans, employers and ACOs.  The Company is the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services, which includes providing information and insights based on the industry-leading menu of routine, non-routine and advanced clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing, and other diagnostic information services.  The DIS business accounted for greater than

90%

of net revenues in

and


.

All other operating segments include the Company's DS businesses, which consists of its risk assessment services, healthcare information technology, diagnostic products (prior to disposition on May 13, 2016), and clinical trials testing (prior to the formation of the Q


Solutions joint venture on July 1, 2015) businesses.  The Company's DS businesses offer a variety of solutions for life insurers and healthcare organizations and clinicians.

In addition to the sale of Focus Diagnostics (see Note 6) in 2016, the Company wound down its Celera products business, which did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  As a result of these transactions, the Company has disposed of its diagnostics products business.

As of

December 31, 2017

, substantially all of the Company’s services were provided within the United States, and substantially all of the Company’s assets were located within the United States.
