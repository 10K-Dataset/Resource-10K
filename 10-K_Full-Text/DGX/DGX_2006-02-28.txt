professionals to make decisions to improve health.  We offer patients and physicians the broadest access to
diagnostic laboratory services through our nationwide network of laboratories
and patient service centers.  We provide
interpretive consultation through the largest medical and scientific staff in
the industry, with more than 500 M.D.’s and Ph.D.’s around the country.  We are the leading provider of esoteric
testing, including gene-based testing and the leading provider of testing for
drugs of abuse.  We are also a leading
provider of anatomic pathology services, testing for clinical trials and risk
assessment services for the life insurance industry.  We empower healthcare organizations and clinicians with
state-of-the-art information technology solutions that can improve patient care
and medical practice.

During
2005, we generated net revenues of $5.5 billion and processed approximately 144
million requisitions for testing. Each requisition form accompanies a patient
specimen, indicating the tests to be performed and the party to be billed for
the tests. Our customers include patients, physicians, hospitals, employers,
governmental institutions and other commercial clinical laboratories.

We
operate a nationwide network of greater than 2,000 patient service centers,
principal laboratories located in more than 35 major metropolitan areas
throughout the United States, and approximately 150 smaller “rapid response”
laboratories (including, in each case, facilities operated at our joint
ventures).  We provide full esoteric
testing services, including gene-based testing, on both coasts through our
Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute laboratory facilities, located in San Juan
Capistrano, California and Chantilly, Virginia.  We also have laboratory facilities in Mexico City, Mexico, San

The United States
Clinical Laboratory Testing Market

Clinical
laboratory testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services.
Physicians use laboratory tests to assist in the detection, diagnosis,
evaluation, monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions.
Clinical laboratory testing is generally categorized as clinical testing and
anatomic pathology testing. Clinical testing is performed on body fluids, such
as blood and urine. Anatomic pathology testing is performed on tissues,
including biopsies, and other samples, such as human cells. Many clinical
laboratory tests are considered routine and can be performed by most commercial
clinical laboratories. Tests that are not routine and that require more
sophisticated equipment and highly skilled personnel are considered esoteric
tests. Esoteric tests, including gene-based tests, are generally referred to laboratories
that specialize in performing those tests.

We
believe that the United States clinical laboratory testing market exceeded $40
billion in annual revenues in 2005.
Most laboratory tests are performed by one of three types of laboratories:
commercial clinical laboratories; hospital-affiliated laboratories; and
physician-office laboratories. In 2005, we believe that hospital-affiliated
laboratories accounted for approximately 60% of the market, commercial clinical
laboratories approximately one-third and physician-office laboratories the
balance.

The
underlying fundamentals of the diagnostic testing industry have improved since
the early to mid-1990s.  Since that time
there has been significant industry consolidation, particularly among
commercial laboratories, resulting in fewer but larger commercial laboratories
with greater economies of scale, better equipped to service the members of
large healthcare plans, and more disciplined in their approach to operating
their business.  Orders for laboratory
testing are generated from physician offices, hospitals and employers.  As such, factors including changes in the
United States economy which can affect

the
number of unemployed and uninsured, and design changes in healthcare plans
which impact the number of physician office and hospital visits, can impact the
utilization of laboratory testing.

While
the diagnostic testing industry in the United States may be impacted by a
number of factors, we believe it will continue to grow over the long term as a
result of the following:

Corporate Strategy
and Growth Opportunities

Our
mission is to be the undisputed world leader in diagnostic testing, information
and services. We focus on Patients, Growth and People to help achieve our
goals.

Patients

are at the center of everything we do.
Increasingly, patients and their doctors have a choice when it comes to
selecting a healthcare provider, and we strive to give them new and compelling
reasons to put their trust in us.  We
differentiate our Company to patients and doctors by:

•

Providing the Highest Quality Services:

We strive to provide
        the highest quality in all that we do including: phlebotomy and specimen
        transport services; analytical testing processes in our laboratories;
        providing accurate and timely lab reports; and billing information. We
        use Six Sigma processes to continuously reduce defects and enhance quality,
        and we are utilizing Lean Six Sigma principles to further increase the
        efficiency of our operations. Six Sigma is a management approach that
        utilizes a thorough understanding of customer needs and requirements,
        root cause analysis, process improvements and rigorous tracking and measuring
        to enhance quality. Lean Six Sigma streamlines processes and eliminates
        waste. We also use Six Sigma and Lean principles to help to standardize
        operations and processes across the Company and adopt identified Company
        best practices.

•

Offering
  Unparalleled Access and Distribution:

We offer the broadest test menu and
  national access to testing services, with facilities in substantially all of
  the major metropolitan areas in the United States. We operate a nationwide
  network of greater than 2,000 patient service centers, principal laboratories
  located in more than 35 major metropolitan areas throughout the United States
  and about 150 smaller “rapid response” laboratories that enable us to serve
  patients, physicians, hospitals, employers and other healthcare providers
  throughout the United States. We believe that customers will increasingly
  seek to utilize laboratory-testing providers that offer a comprehensive range
  of tests and services and the most convenient access to those services.

Growth

is driven organically and through acquisition. We expect to grow organically at
or above the industry growth rate by gaining more customers and selling more to
existing customers. Historically, our industry has focused primarily on service
levels and aggressive pricing to drive organic volume growth. We believe that
the differentiation we are creating through our focus on Six Sigma quality,
unparalleled access and distribution, the most comprehensive test menu and
innovative test and information technology offerings will provide us with a
competitive advantage and enable us to maintain pricing discipline as we drive
profitable organic growth. Additionally, we are investing in sales and
marketing, providing the sales force with better tools and training and adding
innovative new products to sell.  We are
specifically focused on driving profitable organic growth in higher-growth
areas by being a leading innovator. Our principal areas of focus include:

•

Physician Sub Specialties:

While we provide a strong value proposition in routine and esoteric clinical
  testing, we have not been the provider of choice for certain pathology
  testing needs. We are enhancing our test menu and service capabilities to
  more effectively compete in several physician sub specialties, including
  urology, gastroenterology, dermatology and oncology, where we have had a
  smaller market share.

•

Anatomic Pathology:

Of the total United States clinical laboratory testing market, which we
  believe exceeded $40 billion in annual revenues in 2005, we estimate that the
  current United States market for anatomic pathology


services is approximately $7 billion per year. We
  estimate that cytology represents approximately $1 billion per year of this
  market, and that tissue pathology represents approximately $6 billion per
  year of this market.  With the aging
  of the population and the increased incidence of cancer, we believe that the
  tissue pathology business is growing more rapidly and is more profitable than
  the cytology business. We are one of the leading providers of anatomic
  pathology services in the United States. We have traditionally been strongest
  in cytology, specifically in the analysis of Pap tests to detect cervical
  cancer. We led the industry in converting Pap testing to the use of
  liquid-based technology, a more effective means of screening for cervical
  cancer. We are also leading the industry in educating physicians about human
  papilloma virus (HPV) molecular testing. The American College of
  Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Cancer Society
  recommend women over 30 are screened for HPV in addition to a Pap test. We
  intend to continue to expand our anatomic pathology business, particularly in
  tissue pathology.  In conjunction with
  our physician sub-specialty focus, we have been enhancing our anatomic
  pathology capabilities and service offerings and are adding specially trained
  sales representatives.  We generated
  approximately $550 million in net revenues from anatomic pathology services
  during 2005.

•

Innovation
  Leadership:

We intend to build upon our reputation as a
  leading innovator in the clinical laboratory industry by continuing to
  introduce new tests, technology and services. As the industry leader with the
  largest and broadest network and the leading provider of esoteric testing, we
  believe that we are the best partner for developers of new technologies and
  tests to introduce their products to the marketplace. Through our
  relationships with the academic community, pharmaceutical and biotechnology
  firms and emerging medical technology companies that develop and
  commercialize novel diagnostics, pharmaceutical and device technologies, we
  believe that we are one of the leaders in transferring technical innovation
  to the market. Our innovation activities are focused on:

We
expect to continue pursuing growth through acquisitions. Historically, as the
clinical laboratory industry consolidated, acquisitions contributed a
significant portion of our growth. We believe that organic growth will become
more significant, while acquisitions will continue to be an important
contributor to growth.

The
clinical laboratory industry remains highly fragmented. We expect to continue
to selectively evaluate potential acquisitions of regional clinical laboratories
that can be integrated into our existing laboratories, thereby increasing
access for


patients and enabling us to reduce costs and improve
efficiencies. See “Recent Acquisition” for a discussion of our recent
acquisitions. We will also selectively assess potential acquisition
opportunities that will increase clinical capabilities, geographic presence, or
move us into related adjacent spaces, both domestically and internationally.
During 2005, through the acquisition of LabOne, we entered into a new testing-related
field, providing laboratory testing and risk assessment services to the life
insurance industry.

Rapid
development of new tests and technologies continues. In addition, hospitals and
physician office laboratories increasingly are internalizing testing, moving
testing closer to the patient. As a result, we will consider acquiring or
exclusively licensing selective products to complement the services we provide.

Technology
is making possible the convergence of various healthcare disciplines.
Information technology will eventually enable doctors to diagnose and treat
disease by aggregating a patient’s genetic predisposition, diagnostic test
results and diagnostic images into a patient-centric electronic medical record
available in a timely fashion at the point of care. Having such clinical data
in one easily accessed place will enable better decision-making and
drive improved outcomes for patients. Accordingly, potential acquisitions in
adjacent industries such as healthcare information technology and diagnostic
imaging may also be considered. Our acquisition of MedPlus in 2001 was our
first acquisition of a healthcare information technology company.

People

enable us to realize our mission. In this regard, an important challenge is
  to prepare our workforce for the future. Our people strategy is built on concepts
  of stringent employee selection, effective engagement and ongoing development
  resulting in a staff of highly qualified and motivated employees who are committed
  to our goals. In addition, we are committed to improving the health of our employees
  and reducing healthcare costs for them and our Company. Through our HealthyQuest
  initiative, we provide employees with the opportunity to lose weight, quit smoking
  and generally pursue healthier lifestyles. Quest Diagnostics is recognized as
  a “best place to work” in numerous locales as a consequence of our
  workplace initiatives that reflect our belief that people are our most important
  asset. We take diversity seriously, believing that our organization should reasonably
  reflect the communities that we serve. We strive to make all of our employees
  effective ambassadors of our Company.

Recent Acquisition

On
  November 1, 2005, we acquired Lab

One

, Inc., or LabOne, in a transaction
  valued at approximately $947 million, including approximately $138 million of
  assumed debt of LabOne. LabOne provides health screening and risk assessment
  services to life insurance companies, as well as clinical diagnostic testing
  services to healthcare providers and drugs-of-abuse testing to employers. LabOne
  operates major laboratories in Lenexa, Kansas, and Cincinnati, Ohio, as well
  as a state-of-the-art call center in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, and provides
  paramedical examination services throughout the United States and Canada to
  serve the life insurance industry. The acquisition of LabOne supports our growth
  strategy in a number of ways, including: solidifying our leadership position
  in diagnostic testing by expanding access for physicians and patients and giving
  us added presence in several geographic areas; strengthening our drugs-of-abuse
  testing business and establishing us as the leader in a new testing net related
  business, providing health screening and risk assessment services to the life
  insurance industry.

Our Services

For
  2005, our clinical laboratory testing business accounted for approximately 95%
  of our net revenues, with the balance derived from clinical trials testing,
  risk assessment services and other services and products. Laboratory testing
  includes routine testing and gene-based and esoteric testing, which generated
  approximately 78% and 17%, respectively, of our net revenues. Clinical trials
  testing generated less than 3% of our net revenues and risk assessment services
  generated less than 1% of our net revenues. We derive approximately 2% of our
  net revenues from foreign operations. We expect that the risk assessment business
  will represent approximately 4% of our net revenues in 2006, bringing the total
  net revenues attributable to our non-clinical testing businesses to approximately
  8% of our consolidated net revenues.

Routine Testing

Routine
tests measure various important bodily health parameters such as the functions
of the kidney, heart, liver, thyroid and other organs. Commonly ordered tests
include:


We
perform routine testing through our network of major laboratories, rapid
response laboratories and patient service centers. We also perform routine
testing at the hospital laboratories we manage. Major laboratories offer a full
line of routine clinical tests. Rapid response laboratories are smaller
facilities where we can quickly perform an abbreviated menu of routine tests
for customers that require rapid turnaround times. Patient service centers are
facilities where specimens are collected, and are typically located in or near
a building used by medical professionals.

We
operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We perform and report most routine
procedures within 24 hours. The majority of test results are delivered
electronically.

Esoteric Testing

Esoteric
tests are those tests that require more sophisticated technology, equipment or
materials, professional “hands-on” attention from highly skilled and technical
personnel, and that may be performed less frequently than routine tests.
Because it is not cost-effective for most hospital and clinical laboratories to
perform low-volume esoteric tests in-house, they generally refer many of these
tests to an esoteric clinical testing laboratory that specializes in performing
these more complex tests. Due to their complexity, esoteric tests are generally
reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests.

Our
two esoteric testing laboratories, which conduct business as Quest Diagnostics
Nichols Institute, are among the leading esoteric clinical testing laboratories
in the world. In 1998, our esoteric testing laboratory in San Juan Capistrano,
California, was the first clinical laboratory in North America to achieve
International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, 9001 certification. Our
esoteric testing laboratory in Chantilly, Virginia enables us to provide full
esoteric testing services on the east coast. Our two esoteric testing
laboratories perform hundreds of esoteric tests that are not routinely
performed by our regional laboratories. These esoteric tests are generally in
the following fields:


New Test Introductions

We
intend to build upon our reputation as a leading innovator in the clinical laboratory
industry by continuing to introduce new diagnostic tests. As the industry
leader with the largest and broadest laboratory network and the leading
provider of esoteric testing, we believe that we are the best partner for
developers of new technology and tests to introduce their products to the
marketplace.

We
  continued to be a leading innovator in the industry in 2005, through tests that
  we developed at Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, the largest provider of
  molecular diagnostic testing in the United States, as well as through relationships
  with technology developers. We believe that we are one of the leaders in transferring
  technical innovations to the market, through our relationships with the academic
  community and pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, as well as collaborations
  with emerging medical technology companies that develop and commercialize novel
  diagnostics, pharmaceutical and device technologies.

We
primarily focus our resources on three disease states, cardiovascular disease,
cancer and infectious disease, as well as on continued advancements in
molecular diagnostics.  During 2005, we
introduced approximately 75 new and improved assays, including:

We
proactively search for new opportunities in screening, diagnosis, prognosis,
treatment choice and treatment monitoring. We believe that, with the unveiling
of the human genome, and its extension into proteomics, new genes and
combinations of proteins will continue to be discovered at an accelerating
pace and will result in ever more complex and thorough predictive and diagnostic
testing. We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from these advances.

As
testing methods become more complex, we believe that it is also important
to provide sound medical and scientific consultation to ensure the correct
application and interpretation of the test results. Our medical and scientific
directors are always available for consultation to our customers. In 2005,
we further enhanced our consultation programs, supported with our enhanced
reporting initiatives, particularly in the complex areas of hematopathology and
coagulation. We believe consultation services will provide higher confidence in
the adoption of the new tests we develop and lead to improved client
satisfaction and improved patient outcomes.

Risk Assessment Services

We believe that we are the largest provider of risk
assessment services to the life insurance industry in the United States. Our
risk assessment services comprise underwriting support services to the life
insurance industry including teleunderwriting, specimen collection and
paramedical examinations, laboratory testing, medical record retrieval, motor
vehicle reports, telephone inspections and credit checks. The laboratory tests
performed and data gathered by us are specifically designed to assist an insurance
company in objectively evaluating the mortality and morbidity risks posed by
policy applicants. The majority of the testing is performed on specimens of
individual life insurance policy applicants, but also includes specimens of
individuals applying for individual and group medical and disability policies.
We also provide risk assessment services in Canada.

Clinical Trials Testing

We
believe that we are the world’s second largest provider of clinical laboratory
testing performed in connection with clinical research trials on new drugs.
Clinical research trials are required by the Food and Drug Administration, or
FDA, and


other international regulatory authorities to assess
the safety and efficacy of new drugs. We have clinical trials testing centers
in the United States and in the United Kingdom. We also provide clinical trials
testing in Australia, Singapore and South Africa through arrangements with
third parties. Clinical trials involving new drugs are increasingly being
performed both inside and outside the United States. Approximately 50% of our
net revenues from clinical trials testing in 2005 represented testing for
GlaxoSmithKline plc, or GSK. We currently have a long-term contractual
relationship with GSK, under which we are the primary provider of testing to
support GSK’s clinical trials testing requirements worldwide.

Other Services and Products

We
manufacture and market diagnostic test kits and systems primarily for esoteric
testing through our Nichols Institute Diagnostics subsidiary. These are sold
principally to hospitals, clinical laboratories and dialysis centers, both
domestically and internationally.

Our
MedPlus subsidiary is a developer and integrator of clinical connectivity and
data management solutions for healthcare organizations, physicians and
clinicians primarily through its ChartMaxx

â

electronic medical record system for hospitals and our Care360 suite of
products. The Care360 Physician Portal was developed by MedPlus and enables
physicians to order diagnostic tests and review laboratory results from Quest
Diagnostics online. In addition, the Care360 Physician Portal enables
physicians to electronically prescribe medications, view clinical and
administrative information from multiple sources, file certain documents into a
patient-centric health record maintained in our repository and share
confidential patient information with medical colleagues in a manner that is
consistent with HIPAA privacy and security requirements.

Payers and Customers

We
provide testing services to a broad range of healthcare providers. We consider
a “payer” as the party that pays for the test and a “customer” as the party who
refers the test to us. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law,
the payer may be (1) the physician or other party (such as a hospital, another
laboratory or an employer) who referred the testing to us, (2) the patient, or
(3) a third party who pays the bill for the patient, such as an insurance
company, Medicare or Medicaid. Some states, including New York, New Jersey and
Rhode Island, prohibit us from billing physician clients. During 2005, only
three customers accounted for 5% or more of our net revenues, and no single
customer accounted for more than 8% of our net revenues. We believe that the
loss of any one of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The
following table shows current estimates of the breakdown of the percentage of our
total volume of requisitions and net revenues associated with our clinical
laboratory testing business during 2005 applicable to each payer group:

Physicians

Physicians
requiring testing for patients are the primary referral source of our clinical
laboratory testing volume. Testing referred by physicians is typically billed
to healthcare insurers, government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid,
patients and physicians. Physicians are typically billed on a fee-for-service
basis based on negotiated fee schedules. Fees billed to patients and healthcare
insurers are based on the laboratory’s patient fee schedule, subject to any
limitations on fees negotiated with the healthcare insurers or with physicians
on behalf of their patients. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements are based on
fee schedules set by governmental authorities.

Healthcare Insurers

Healthcare
insurers, including managed care organizations and other healthcare insurance
providers, which typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of
clinical laboratories on behalf of their members, represent approximately one-


half of our total testing volumes and one-half of our
net revenues. Larger healthcare insurers typically prefer to use large
commercial clinical laboratories because they can provide services to their
members on a national or regional basis. In addition, larger laboratories are
better able to achieve the low-cost structures necessary to profitably service
the members of large healthcare plans and can provide test utilization data
across various products in a consistent format. Healthcare insurers frequently
require test utilization data in order to meet the reporting requirements of
the National Committee for Quality Assurance, or NCQA, to implement disease
management programs and for other health plan operation purposes. In certain
markets, such as California, healthcare insurers may delegate their covered
members to independent physician associations, or IPAs, which in turn negotiate
with laboratories for clinical laboratory services on behalf of their
members.

In
  recent years, healthcare insurers have begun to offer more freedom of choice
  to their members, including greater freedom to determine which laboratory to
  use and which tests to order. Accordingly, most of our agreements with major
  healthcare insurers are non-exclusive arrangements. As a result, under these
  non-exclusive arrangements, physicians and patients have more freedom of choice
  in selecting laboratories, and laboratories are likely to compete more on the
  basis of service and quality than they may otherwise. Also, healthcare plans
  are increasingly offering programs such as preferred provider organizations,
  or PPOs, and consumer driven health plans that offer a greater choice of healthcare
  providers. Pricing for these programs is typically negotiated on a fee-for-service
  basis, which generally results in higher revenue per requisition than under
  capitation arrangements. If consumer driven plans and PPO plans increase in
  popularity, it will be increasingly important for healthcare providers to differentiate
  themselves based on quality, service and convenience to avoid competing on price
  alone. Despite these trends, healthcare insurers continue to aggressively seek
  cost reductions in order to keep premiums to their customers competitive. If
  the Company is unable to agree on terms with a healthcare insurer, we could
  become a “non-participating” provider which may require us to bill
  the patient, or in certain cases the physician, rather than the healthcare insurer.
  This “non-participating” status could lead to loss of business since
  typically in these instances patients have a higher co-insurance responsibility
  and physicians may therefore not refer testing to a non-participating provider.

The
trend of consolidation among healthcare insurers has continued, resulting in
fewer but larger insurers with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee
arrangements with healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. These
healthcare insurers, as well as IPAs, demand that clinical laboratory service
providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the
financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members
through capitated payment arrangements. Under these capitated payment
arrangements, we and healthcare insurers agree to a predetermined monthly
reimbursement rate for each member of the healthcare insurer’s plan, regardless
of the number or cost of services provided by us. Some services, such as
various esoteric tests, new technologies and anatomic pathology services, may
be carved out from a capitated rate and, if carved out, are charged on a
fee-for-service basis. We work closely with healthcare insurers as they
evaluate new tests; however, as innovation in the testing area increases, there
is no guarantee that healthcare insurers will agree to offer the technology as
a covered service, carve out these services or reimburse them at rates that
reflect the true cost or value associated with such services.

Historically,
most Medicare beneficiaries were covered under the traditional Medicare
program, but the federal government has, over the last several years, effected
various proposals in an effort to increase enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries
in the private managed care system. With the enactment of The Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, which
renamed the private Medicare program “Medicare Advantage” and created an
additional product that allows for regional Preferred Provider Organization, it
is possible that the Company may begin to experience a shift of traditional
Medicare beneficiaries to private Medicare Advantage programs.

A
significant portion of the laboratory costs incurred by healthcare insurers is
for payments made to non-contracted providers (primarily hospitals) at rates
exceeding those of contracted providers. We offer QuestNet

ä

,
a service whereby we develop and administer customized networks of clinical
laboratory providers for healthcare insurers. Through QuestNet

ä

,
physicians and members are provided multiple choices for clinical laboratory
testing while healthcare insurers realize cost reductions from reducing testing
performed by non-contracted providers.

Hospitals

Hospitals
generally maintain an on-site laboratory to perform testing on patients and refer
less frequently needed and highly specialized procedures to outside
laboratories, which typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated
fee-for-service basis. Fee schedules for hospital reference testing are
typically negotiated on behalf of the hospitals by group purchasing
organizations. We believe that most hospital laboratories perform approximately
90% to 95% of their patients’ clinical laboratory tests. We provide services to
hospitals throughout the United States that vary from esoteric testing to
helping manage their laboratories. We believe that we are the industry’s market
leader in servicing hospitals. Our hospital customers account for approximately
12% of our net revenues, the majority of which represents services billed to
the hospitals for certain testing that the hospitals do not perform internally.
Hospitals continue to look for ways to fully utilize their existing laboratory
capacity through test internalization as well as competing with commercial
laboratories for outreach (non-hospital patients)


testing. Most physicians have admitting privileges or
other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice. Many
hospitals leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage
the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory. In
addition, hospitals that own physician practices generally require the
physicians to refer tests to the hospital’s affiliated laboratory.

We
have dedicated sales and service teams focused on serving the unique needs of
hospital customers. We believe that the combination of full-service, bi-coastal
esoteric testing capabilities, medical and scientific professionals for
consultation, innovative connectivity products, focus on Six Sigma quality and
dedicated sales and service professionals has positioned us to be a partner of
choice for hospital customers.

We
have joint venture arrangements with leading integrated healthcare delivery
networks in several metropolitan areas. These joint venture arrangements, which
provide testing for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians
and other healthcare providers in their geographic areas, serve as our
principal laboratory facilities in their service areas. Typically, we have
either a majority ownership interest in, or day-to-day management
responsibilities for, our hospital joint venture relationships. We also manage
the laboratories at a number of other hospitals.

Employers, Governmental Institutions and Other Clinical
Laboratories

We
provide testing services to federal, state and local governmental agencies and
to large employers. We believe that we are the leading provider of clinical
laboratory testing to employers for drugs of abuse. We also provide wellness
testing to employers to enable employees to take an active role in improving
their health.  Testing services for
employers account for approximately 3% of our net revenues. The volume of
testing services for employers, which generally have relatively low profit
margins, has increased moderately in 2005, driven by an increase in hiring. We
also perform esoteric testing services for other commercial clinical
laboratories that do not have a full range of testing capabilities. All of
these customers are charged on a fee-for-service basis.

Sales and Marketing

We
market to and service our customers through our direct sales force, healthplan
sales force, customer service representatives and couriers.

We
focus our sales efforts on obtaining and retaining profitable accounts. We have
an active customer management process to evaluate the growth potential and
profitability of all accounts.

Our
sales force is organized by customer type with the majority of representatives
focused on marketing clinical laboratory testing and related services to
physicians, including specialty physicians such as oncologists, urologists and
gastroenterologists. Additionally, we have a healthplan sales organization that
focuses on regional and national insurance and healthcare organizations.  We also have a hospital sales organization
that focuses on meeting the unique needs of hospitals and promotes the
specialized capabilities of our Nichols Institute esoteric testing
laboratories. Supporting our physician sales teams are genomics and esoteric
testing specialists, who are specially trained and focused on educating our
clients on new and more complex tests. A smaller portion of our sales force
focuses on selling substance-of-abuse and wellness testing to employers. With
the completion of the LabOne acquisition, we now have a sales force that
focuses on selling risk assessment testing services to life insurance
companies.

Customer
service representatives perform a number of services for patients and
customers. They monitor services, answer questions and help resolve problems.
Our couriers pick up specimens from most clients daily.

Our
corporate marketing function is organized by customer type and is responsible
for developing and executing marketing strategies, new product launches, and
promotional and advertising support.

Information Systems

Information
systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business,
including laboratory testing, billing, customer service, logistics and management
of medical data. The successful delivery of our services depends, in part, on
the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology, or
IT, systems. IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of root causes,
including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and
natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security measures, some of our
servers are potentially exposed to physical or electronic break-in attempts,
computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary
measures that we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect
our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that would interrupt our
ability


to process test orders, deliver test results or perform
tests in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in a
loss of customers and net revenues.

Historically,
acquired companies were often operated as local decentralized units, and we did
not standardize their billing, laboratory or their other core information
systems. This resulted in many different information systems for billing, test
results reporting and other transactions.

During
  2002, we began implementation of a standard laboratory information system and
  a standard billing system across all of our operations, including those from
  our most recent acquisitions. The deployment of standardized systems is continuing
  and we expect that it will take several years to complete. It will result in
  significantly more centralized systems than we have even today and better control
  over the operational environment. We expect the integration of these systems
  will improve operating efficiency and provide management with more timely and
  comprehensive information with which to make management decisions. However,
  failure or delays in properly implementing this standardization process could
  materially adversely affect our business. During system conversions of this
  magnitude, workflow is re-engineered to take advantage of best practices and
  enhanced system capabilities and may temporarily affect the delivery of our
  services. In addition, the implementation process, including the transfer of
  databases and master files to new data centers, presents significant conversion
  risks that need to be managed very carefully.

Billing

Billing
for laboratory services is complicated. Depending on the billing arrangement
and applicable law, we must bill various payers, such as patients, insurance
companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians and employer groups, all of which
have different billing requirements. Additionally, auditing for compliance with
applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and
procedures adds further complexity to the billing process. Other factors that
complicate billing include:

We
incur additional costs as a result of our participation in Medicare and
Medicaid programs, as billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing
is subject to considerable and complex federal and state regulations. These
additional costs include those related to: (1) complexity added to our billing
processes; (2) training and education of our employees and customers; (3)
compliance and legal costs; and (4) costs related to, among other factors,
medical necessity denials and advance beneficiary notices. Compliance with
applicable laws and regulations, as well as internal compliance policies and
procedures, adds further complexity and costs to our operations. Changes in
laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to bill our clients.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, establishes
procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the
reimbursement process.

We
believe that most of our bad debt expense, which was 4.2% of our net revenues
in 2005, is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing information on
requisitions received from healthcare providers and the failure of patients to
pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility rather than
credit related issues. In general, we perform the requested tests and report
test results regardless of whether the billing information is incorrect or
missing. We subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient
to obtain any missing information and rectify incorrect billing information.
Missing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows
the billing process, creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions, and generally
increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense (see
“Regulation of Reimbursement for Clinical Laboratory Services”).

Competition

While
there has been significant consolidation in the clinical laboratory testing
industry in recent years, our industry remains fragmented and highly
competitive. We primarily compete with three types of laboratory providers:
hospital-affiliated laboratories, other commercial clinical laboratories and
physician-office laboratories. We are the leading clinical laboratory testing
provider in the United States, with net revenues of $5.5 billion during 2005,
and facilities in substantially all of the country’s major metropolitan areas.
Our largest competitor is Laboratory
Corporation of America Holdings, Inc. In addition,


we compete with many smaller regional and local
commercial clinical laboratories, specialized esoteric labs, as well as
laboratories owned by physicians and hospitals (see “Payers and Customers”).

We
believe that healthcare providers consider a number of factors when selecting a
laboratory, including:

We
believe that we compete favorably in each of these areas.

We
believe that large commercial clinical laboratories may be able to increase
their share of the overall clinical laboratory testing market due to their
large service networks and lower cost structures. These advantages should
enable larger clinical laboratories to more effectively serve large customers
and members of large healthcare plans. In addition, we believe that
consolidation in the clinical laboratory testing industry will continue.  However, a majority of the clinical
laboratory testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals, which
generally have affiliations with community physicians that refer testing to us
(see “Payers and Customers– Hospitals”). As a result of these affiliations, we
compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of
service capability and quality as well as other non-pricing factors. Our
failure to provide service superior to hospital-affiliated laboratories and
other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and
profitability.

The
diagnostic testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product
introductions. Advances in technology may lead to the development of more
cost-effective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical
laboratory such as (1) point-of-care tests that can be performed by physicians
in their offices; (2) esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in
their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without
requiring the services of clinical laboratories.  Development of such technology and its use by our customers and
patients would reduce the demand for our laboratory testing services and
negatively impact our net revenues (see “Regulation of Clinical Laboratory
Operations”).

Quality Assurance

Our
goal is to continually improve the processes for collection, storage and
transportation of patient specimens, as well as the precision and accuracy of
analysis and result reporting. Our quality assurance efforts focus on
proficiency testing, process audits, statistical process control and personnel
training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers. We continue
to implement our Six Sigma and standardization initiatives to help achieve our
goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the healthcare
services industry. Our Nichols Institute facility in San Juan Capistrano was
the first clinical laboratory in North America to achieve ISO certification.
Two of our clinical trials laboratories, our diagnostic kits facility and two
of our routine laboratories are also ISO certified.  These certifications are international standards for quality
management systems.

Internal
Proficiency Testing, Quality Control and Audits.

Quality
control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient
specimens. The results of tests on quality control samples are monitored to
identify trends, biases or imprecision in our analytical processes. We also
perform internal process audits as part of our comprehensive Quality Assurance
program.

External
Proficiency Testing and Accreditation.

All of our
laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs.
They include, but are not limited to, proficiency testing programs administered
by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, as well as some state
agencies.

CAP
is an independent, non-governmental organization of board certified
pathologists. CAP is approved by CMS to inspect clinical laboratories to
determine compliance with the standards required by the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA. CAP offers an accreditation program to
which laboratories may voluntarily subscribe. All of


our major regional laboratories are accredited by CAP.
Accreditation includes on-site inspections and participation in the CAP (or
equivalent) proficiency testing program. “CAP whistle blower” hotline posters,
which are used to escalate unresolved quality and laboratory safety concerns to
CAP, are posted in all of our CAP accredited laboratories.

Regulation of Clinical Laboratory Operations

The
  clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant federal and state regulation,
  including inspections and audits by governmental agencies. Governmental authorities
  may impose fines or criminal penalties or take other actions to enforce laws
  and regulations, including revoking a clinical laboratory’s federal certification,
  which is required to operate a clinical laboratory operation. Changes in regulations
  may (i) increase our operating costs including, but not limited to, those costs
  associated with performing clinical laboratory tests, and administrative requirements
  related to billing or (ii) decrease the amount of reimbursement related to testing
  services performed.

CLIA
and State Regulation.

All of our laboratories and (where
applicable) patient service centers are licensed and accredited by the
appropriate federal and state agencies. CLIA regulates virtually all clinical
laboratories by requiring they be certified by the federal government and
comply with various operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to
ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable and
timely. CLIA does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal
law. For example, state laws may require additional personnel qualifications,
quality control, record maintenance and/or proficiency testing. The cost of
compliance with CLIA makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate
clinical laboratories in their offices. However, manufacturers of laboratory
equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing
point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling to both
physicians and patients test kits approved by the FDA for home use.  Diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the
FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under CLIA and
may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory
oversight under CLIA as well as by patients in their homes.

Drug
Testing.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, or SAMHSA, regulates drug testing for public sector employees
and employees of certain federally regulated businesses. SAMHSA has established
detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet to
perform drug testing on these employees. All laboratories that perform such
testing must be certified as meeting SAMHSA standards. All of our laboratories
that perform such testing are certified as meeting SAMHSA standards.

Controlled
Substances.

The federal Drug Enforcement Administration, or
DEA, regulates access to controlled substances used to perform drugs of abuse
testing. To obtain access to controlled substances, laboratories must be
licensed by the DEA. All of our laboratories that use controlled substances are
licensed by the DEA.

Medical
Waste, Hazardous Waste and Radioactive Materials.

Clinical
laboratories are also subject to federal, state and local regulations relating
to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and
radioactive materials. We generally use outside vendors to dispose of such
waste.

FDA.

The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and
other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories. In
the past, the FDA has claimed regulatory authority over laboratory-developed
tests, but has exercised enforcement discretion in not regulating most
laboratory-developed tests performed by high complexity CLIA-certified
laboratories. In December 2000, the Department of Health and Human Services, or
HHS, Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing recommended that the FDA
be the lead federal agency to regulate genetic testing. In late 2002, a new HHS
Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society, or SACGHS, was
appointed to replace the prior Advisory Committee. In June 2004, SACGHS
announced that its priorities included Overview of the Oversight of Genetic
Technologies. Ultimately, SACGHS decided that it would continue to monitor the
progress of the federal agencies in the oversight of genetic technologies, but
it did not believe that further action was warranted. In the meantime, the FDA
is considering revising its regulations on analyte specific reagents, which are
used in laboratory-developed tests, including laboratory-developed genetic
testing. FDA interest in or actual regulation of laboratory-developed tests or
increased regulation of the various medical devices used in
laboratory-developed testing could lead to periodic inquiry letters from the
FDA and increased costs and delays in introducing new tests, including genetic
tests. Representatives of clinical laboratories (including Quest Diagnostics)
and the American Clinical Laboratory Association (our industry trade
association), or ACLA, have communicated industry concerns to representatives
of the FDA regarding potential FDA regulation of genetic testing in general and
issues with regard to the impact of potential increased oversight over analyte
specific reagents. We expect those discussions to continue.

Occupational
Safety.

The federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, or OSHA, has established extensive requirements relating
specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers. This includes
requirements to


develop and implement multi-faceted programs to
protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, such as HIV and
hepatitis B and C, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through
sharps or needle stick injuries.

Specimen
Transportation.

Transportation of most clinical laboratory
specimens and some laboratory supplies are considered hazardous materials
subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation, the Public Health
Service, the United States Postal Service and the International Air Transport
Association.

Corporate
Practice of Medicine.

Many states, including some in which
our principal laboratories are located, prohibit corporations from engaging in
the practice of medicine. The corporate practice of medicine doctrine has been
interpreted in certain states to prohibit corporations from employing licensed
healthcare professionals to provide services on the corporation’s behalf. The
scope of the doctrine, and how it applies, varies from state to state. In
certain states these restrictions affect our ability to directly provide
anatomic pathology services and/or to provide clinical laboratory services
directly to consumers.

Healthcare
Information Technology

Clinical
laboratories use information technology to obtain laboratory orders and to
communicate results and provide other laboratory reporting. Innovations in
healthcare information technology, or HCIT, have the potential to improve
patient care, promote efficiency and reduce expense. Both at the federal and
state levels, there are public and private efforts to bring together healthcare
providers, information technology vendors, and other stakeholders to coordinate
federal healthcare information standards and develop a national healthcare
network, including adopting standard code sets and developing standards for
electronic interoperability (standards for the exchange and use of electronic
healthcare data).

We
and MedPlus, our HCIT subsidiary, could be impacted by any national healthcare
information network and the adoption of standards for HCIT interoperability,
because of substantial existing investments in software and hardware and the
potential for having to make substantial future investments to comply with new
or different standards. On October 11, 2005, as required by the MMA, the Office
of the Inspector General, or OIG, published a proposed safe harbor to the
federal anti-kickback statute and CMS published proposed exceptions to the
Stark self-referral prohibition law that would permit certain providers other
than clinical laboratories to provide e-prescribing items and services to
physicians for free. If these regulations are adopted as proposed, certain
providers would be able to provide broader packages of HCIT items or services
than clinical laboratories which could create incentives for some customers to
choose such providers. We are commenting on the proposed rules through our
industry trade association, ACLA, reflecting our position that if any providers
are permitted to be donors of e-prescribing or EHR items or services, then all
providers should be entitled to the same protections afforded by the proposed
safe harbor and self-referral prohibition exceptions.

We
and ACLA, our trade association, are monitoring standards development, proposed
legislation and rulemaking proceedings and we are providing relevant
information to policy makers to ensure that issues important to medical
laboratories are reflected in any interoperability standards, HCIT legislation
and proposed regulations.

Privacy and
Security of Health Information; Standard Transactions

Pursuant
to HIPAA, the Secretary of HHS has issued final regulations designed to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the
electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative
transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information
exchanged. Three principal regulations have been issued in final form: privacy
regulations, security regulations and standards for electronic transactions.

The
HIPAA privacy regulations, which fully came into effect in April 2003,
establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and
disclosures of protected health information by health plans, healthcare
providers and healthcare clearinghouses. The regulations establish a complex
regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:


•

administrative, technical and physical safeguards
  required of entities that use or receive protected health information.

We
have implemented practices to meet the requirements of the HIPAA privacy
regulations. The HIPAA privacy regulations establish a “floor” and do not
supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are required to
comply with both federal privacy standards and varying state privacy laws. In
addition, for healthcare data transfers relating to citizens of other
countries, we need to comply with the laws of other countries. The federal
privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose
patient-identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for
purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by
HIPAA) except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other
permitted purposes outlined in the final privacy regulations. The privacy
regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use
or disclosure of protected health information, including potential civil and
criminal fines and penalties.  Although
the HIPAA statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right
of damages, we could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the
wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private
personal information.

The
final HIPAA security regulations, which establish requirements for safeguarding
electronic patient information, were published on February 20, 2003 and became
effective on April 21, 2003, although healthcare providers had until April 20,
2005 to comply. We have implemented policies and standards to reasonably and
appropriately comply with the requirements of the regulations.

The
final HIPAA regulations for electronic transactions, which we refer to as the
transaction standards, establish uniform standards for electronic transactions
and code sets, including the electronic transactions and code sets used for
billing claims, remittance advices, enrollment and eligibility. HHS issued
guidance on July 24, 2003 stating that it would not penalize a covered entity
for post-implementation date transactions that are not fully compliant with the
transactions standards, if the covered entity could demonstrate its good faith
efforts to comply with the standards. However, beginning October 1, 2005, CMS
no longer processes incoming non-HIPAA compliant electronic Medicare claims.

Many
  of our payers were not ready to implement the transaction standards by the October
  2003 compliance deadline or were not ready to test or trouble-shoot claims submissions.
  Since that time, significant progress has been made in implementing the transaction
  standards with our payers. As of December 31, 2005, we are substantially complete
  with the conversion to the required standard format for our electronic fee-for-service
  claim transactions and our electronic fee-for-service remittance transactions.
  In September 2005, as part of HIPAA Administrative Simplification, HHS published
  a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Standards for Electronic Health Care Claims
  Attachments. We are commenting on this proposal through ACLA, our industry trade
  association, and final rule publication from HHS is not anticipated prior to
  mid-2006. Upon final rule publication, the implementation period for electronic
  health care claim attachments is anticipated to be two years at a minimum.

The
HIPAA transaction standards are complex and subject to differences in
interpretation by payers. For instance, some payers may interpret the standards
to require us to provide certain types of information, including demographic
information not usually provided to us by physicians. We are working closely
with our payers to establish acceptable protocols for claims submissions and
with our industry trade association and an industry coalition to present issues
and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting
organizations.

Regulation of
Reimbursement for Clinical Laboratory Services

Overview.

The healthcare industry has experienced significant changes in reimbursement
practices during the past several years. Government payers, such as Medicare
(which principally serves patients 65 years and older) and Medicaid (which
principally serves indigent patients), as well as private payers and large
employers, have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the cost,
utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including clinical laboratory
services. If we cannot offset additional reductions in the payments we receive
for our services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing
new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and
profitability.

While
the total cost to comply with Medicare administrative requirements is
disproportionate to our cost to bill other payers, average Medicare
reimbursement rates are not materially different than our overall average
reimbursement rate from all payers, making this business generally less
profitable. Despite the added cost and complexity of participating in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs, we continue to participate in such programs
because we believe that our other business may depend, in part, on continued
participation in these programs, since certain customers may want a single
laboratory capable of performing all of their clinical laboratory testing services,
regardless of who pays for such services.


Billing
and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to significant and
complex federal and state regulation. Penalties for violations of laws relating
to billing federal healthcare programs and for violations of federal fraud and
abuse laws include: (1) exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid
programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties;
and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary
to operate some or all of a clinical laboratory’s business. Civil monetary
penalties for a wide range of violations are not more than $10,000 per
violation plus three times the amount claimed and, in the case of kickback violations,
not more than $50,000 per violation plus up to three times the amount of
remuneration involved. A parallel civil remedy under the federal False Claims
Act provides for damages not more than $11,000 per violation plus up to three
times the amount claimed.

Reduced
Reimbursements.

In 1984, Congress established a Medicare fee
schedule payment methodology for clinical laboratory services performed for
patients covered under Part B of the Medicare program. Congress then imposed a
national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local
Medicare fee schedules. Since then, Congress has periodically reduced the
national ceilings. The Medicare national fee schedule limitations were reduced
in 1996 to 76% of the 1984 national median of the local fee schedules and in
1998 to 74% of the 1984 national median. The national ceiling applies to tests
for which limitation amounts were established before January 1, 2001.  For more recent tests (tests for which a
limitation amount is first established on or after January 1, 2001), the
limitation amount is set at 100% of the median of all the local fee schedules
established for that test in accordance with the Social Security Act. The MMA
eliminated for five years (beginning January 1, 2004) the provision for annual
increases to the Medicare national fee schedule based on the consumer price
index. Thus, by law an adjustment to the national fee schedule for clinical
laboratory services based on the consumer price index cannot occur before
January 1, 2009. However, the MMA added coverage for certain cardiovascular
screening tests and diabetes screening tests, subject to certain frequency
limitations. The MMA evaluates new diagnostic tests for coverage as they are
introduced. In addition, the 2005 Physician Fee Schedule rule proposed to lower
Medicare’s payment rates for flow cytometry services in 2005. Quest Diagnostics
believed that CMS failed to properly value these services and commented on this
proposed change through ACLA. Pathology services are reimbursed by Medicare
according to a Physician Fee Schedule based on a resource-based relative value
scale, or RBRVS, that is periodically updated by CMS. On November 21, 2005, CMS
published its Final Physician Fee Schedule Rule (effective January 1, 2006) but
did not implement any changes to the Practice Expense values in the new fee
schedule, leaving the lower reimbursement for flow cytometry in place for 2006.
In addition, the formula used for RBRVS calls for a 4.4% reduction in the 2006
payment level for physicians services, including anatomic pathology services
payable to clinical laboratories. In February 2006, Congress eliminated the
4.4% reduction in the 2006 Physician Fee Schedule, keeping the reimbursement
for physician services (including anatomic pathology services billed by
clinical laboratories) unchanged from 2005. Approximately 1% of our net
revenues are derived from pathology services reimbursed by Medicare based on
RBRVS.

With
regard to the clinical laboratory services performed on behalf of Medicare
beneficiaries, we must bill the Medicare program directly and must accept the
carrier’s fee schedule amount as payment in full. In addition, state Medicaid
programs are prohibited from paying more (and in most instances, pay significantly
less) than Medicare. Major clinical laboratories, including Quest Diagnostics,
typically use two fee schedules for tests billed on a fee-for-service basis:

•

“Client” fees charged to physicians, hospitals, and
  institutions for which a clinical laboratory performs testing services on a
  wholesale basis and which are billed on a monthly basis. These fees are
  generally subject to negotiation or discount.

•

“Patient” fees charged to individual patients and
  third-party payers, like Medicare and Medicaid. These fees generally require
  separate bills for each requisition.

The
fee schedule amounts established by Medicare are typically substantially lower
than patient fees otherwise charged by us, but are sometimes higher than our
fees actually charged to certain clients. During 1992, the OIG of the HHS
issued final regulations that prohibited charging Medicare fees substantially
in excess of a provider’s usual charges. The laboratory industry believes that
the term “usual charges” specifically applies to amounts charged to
similarly-situated third-party payers and to patients and that client fees
should not be included in “usual charges”. The OIG, however, declined to
provide any guidance concerning interpretation of these rules, including whether
or not discounts to non-governmental clients and payers or the dual-fee
structure might be inconsistent with these rules.

A
proposed rule released in September 1997 would have authorized the OIG to
exclude providers from participation in the Medicare program, including
clinical laboratories, that charge Medicare and other programs fees that are
“substantially in excess of . . . usual charges . . . to any of [their]
customers, clients or patients”. This proposal was withdrawn by the OIG in
1998. In November 1999, the OIG issued an advisory opinion which indicated that
a clinical laboratory offering discounts on client bills may violate the “usual
charges” regulation if the “charge to Medicare substantially exceeds the amount
the laboratory most frequently charges or has contractually agreed to accept
from non-Federal payers”. The OIG subsequently issued a letter clarifying that
the usual charges regulation is not a blanket prohibition on discounts to
private pay customers.


In
September 2003, the OIG published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would
amend the OIG’s exclusion regulations addressing excessive claims. Under the
proposed exclusion rule, the OIG would have the authority to exclude a provider
for submitting claims to Medicare that contain charges that are substantially
in excess of the provider’s usual charges. The proposal would define “usual
charges” as the average payment from non-government entities, on a test by test
basis, excluding capitated payments; and would define “substantially in excess”
to be an amount that is more than 20% greater than the usual charge. We believe
that the rule is unnecessary for the clinical laboratory industry because
Congress has already established fee schedules for the services that the rule
proposes to regulate. We also believe that the rule is unworkable and overly
burdensome. Through our industry trade association, we filed comments opposing
the proposed rule and we are working with our trade association and a coalition
of other healthcare providers who also oppose this proposed regulation as
drafted. If this regulation is adopted as proposed, it could potentially reduce
the amounts we bill and collect from Medicare and other federal payers, affect
the fees we charge to other payers, or subject the Company to penalties for
non-compliance, and could also be costly for us to administer.

The
  1997 Balanced Budget Act permits CMS to adjust statutorily prescribed fees for
  some medical services, including clinical laboratory services, if the fees are
  “grossly excessive”. In December 2002, CMS issued an interim final
  rule setting forth a process and factors for establishing a “realistic
  and equitable” payment amount for all Medicare Part B services (except
  physician services and services paid under a prospective payment system) when
  the existing payment amounts are determined to be inherently unreasonable. Payment
  amounts may be considered unreasonable because they are either grossly excessive
  or deficient. In December 2005, CMS published the final rule clarifying that
  if CMS or a carrier determines that an overall payment adjustment of less than
  15% is needed to produce a realistic and equitable payment amount, then the
  payment amount is not considered “grossly excessive or deficient.”
  However, if a determination is made that a payment adjustment of 15% or more
  is justified, CMS could provide an adjustment of less than 15%, but not more
  than 15%, in any given year. We cannot provide any assurances to investors that
  fees payable by Medicare could not be reduced as a result of the application
  of this rule or that the government might not assert claims for reimbursement
  by purporting to retroactively apply this rule or the OIG interpretation concerning
  “usual charges.”

Currently,
  Medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a co-payment for clinical laboratory
  testing. When co-payments were last in effect before adoption of the clinical
  laboratory services fee schedules in 1984, clinical laboratories received from
  Medicare carriers only 80% of the Medicare allowed amount and were required
  to bill Medicare beneficiaries for the unpaid balance of the Medicare allowed
  amount. If re-enacted, a co-payment requirement could adversely affect the revenues
  of the clinical laboratory industry, including us, by exposing the testing laboratory
  to the credit of individuals and by increasing the number of bills. In addition,
  a laboratory could be subject to potential fraud and abuse violations if adequate
  procedures to bill and collect the co-payments are not established and followed.
  The Medicare reform bill approved by the United States Senate in June 2003 included
  a co-payment provision, under which clinical laboratories would receive from
  Medicare carriers only 80% of the Medicare allowed amount for clinical laboratory
  tests and would be required to bill Medicare beneficiaries for the 20% balance
  of the Medicare allowed amount. The co-payment provision was dropped from the
  bill as passed (known as the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
  Act of 2003). We cannot provide any assurances to investors that Congress would
  not seek to re-impose a copayment requirement payable by Medicare beneficiaries
  for clinical laboratory services. Certain Medicaid programs already require
  Medicaid recipients to pay co-payment amounts for clinical laboratory testing.

Reduced
Utilization of Clinical Laboratory Testing.

In recent years,
CMS has taken several steps to reduce utilization of clinical laboratory testing.
Since 1995, Medicare carriers have adopted policies under which they do not pay
for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has
provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the
test. Physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when
they order clinical tests for Medicare and Medicaid patients. However, CMS has
not prescribed any penalty for physicians who fail to provide this diagnostic
information to laboratories. Moreover, regulations adopted in accordance with
HIPAA require submission of diagnosis codes as part of the standard claims
transaction.

We
are generally permitted to bill patients directly for some statutorily excluded
clinical laboratory services. If a patient signs an advance beneficiary notice,
or ABN, we are also generally permitted to bill patients for clinical
laboratory tests that Medicare does not cover due to “medical necessity”
limitations (these tests include limited coverage tests for which the ordering
physician did not provide an appropriate diagnosis code and certain tests
ordered on a patient at a frequency greater than covered by Medicare). An ABN
is a notice signed by the beneficiary which documents the patient’s informed
decision to personally assume financial liability for laboratory tests which
are likely to be denied and not reimbursed by Medicare because they are deemed
to be not medically necessary.  We do
not have any direct contact with most of these patients and, in such cases,
cannot control the proper use of the ABN by the physician or the physician’s
office staff. If the ABN is not timely provided to the beneficiary or is not
completed properly, we may end up performing tests that we cannot subsequently
bill to the patient if they are not reimbursable by Medicare due to coverage
limitations.


Inconsistent
Practices.

Currently, many different local carriers
administer Medicare. They have inconsistent policies on matters such as: (1)
test coverage; (2) automated chemistry panels; (3) diagnosis coding; (4) claims
documentation; and (5) fee schedules (subject to the national fee schedule
limitations). Inconsistent carrier rules and policies have increased the
complexity of the billing process for clinical laboratories. As part of the
1997 Balanced Budget Act, HHS was required to adopt uniform policies on the
above matters by January 1, 1999, and to replace the current local carriers
with no more than five regional carriers. Although HHS has finalized a number
of uniform test coverage/diagnosis coding policies, it has not taken any final
action to replace the local carriers with five regional carriers.

Carrier
Jurisdiction Changes for Lab-to-Lab Referrals.

On October 31, 2003, CMS announced its
intention to change the manner in which Medicare contractors currently process
claims for lab-to-lab referrals of clinical laboratory tests. While
laboratories are, under certain criteria, permitted to directly bill Medicare
for clinical laboratory tests they refer to other laboratories, they must be
reimbursed at the correct fee schedule amount based on the Medicare fee
schedule in effect in the Medicare carrier region in which the test was
actually performed. Historically, laboratories needed to enroll with and file
claims to multiple carriers in order to bill for such out-of-area test
referrals, to ensure receipt of the appropriate payment amount. This has proven
to be an administratively difficult process, with many obstacles to obtaining
accurate claims payment, including applying the correct fee schedule. On July
1, 2004, CMS implemented a change that mandated that the laboratory’s “home”
carrier maintain and apply the clinical laboratory fee schedule applicable to
the carrier region where the test was performed. This streamlined process
allows a laboratory to file all of its clinical laboratory claims to its “home”
carrier.

CMS
also has announced a parallel change with regard to purchased diagnostic
interpretations (pathology services). A previously announced change in Medicare
carrier jurisdiction rules required laboratories to bill the carrier where a
purchased diagnostic interpretation service was performed. This would have
required carriers to issue Medicare provider numbers to the billing laboratory.
In October 2004, CMS posted a “change notice” permitting laboratories to
temporarily bill their local carriers for purchased diagnostic tests or
interpretations regardless of the location where the service was furnished. The
final change notice was issued on October 29, 2004, effective April 1, 2005.
The final notice requires carriers to implement a new edit to check for
duplicate claims for referred clinical diagnostic laboratory and purchased
diagnostic services submitted by physicians/suppliers to more than one carrier.

Competitive
Bidding.

The MMA requires CMS to conduct two demonstration
projects of competitive bidding for clinical laboratory tests. CMS awarded the
clinical laboratory competitive bidding demonstration design and implementation
contract to RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and its
subcontractor, Palmetto GBA. Palmetto is a Part B carrier and previously
conducted for CMS a competitive bidding demonstration for Durable Medical
Equipment (DME). In August 2005, RTI presented its draft design at a public
meeting. The RTI proposal incorporated several ACLA recommendations, including
having bidders bid on the full range of tests paid under the laboratory fee
schedule, utilizing a fee-for-service basis for bidding, and allowing bidders
to subcontract. CMS has not made any final decisions on the RTI draft design,
but was required to submit its initial report on the competitive bidding
proposal by December 31, 2005. CMS’ status report is currently in the clearance
process at CMS and has not yet been submitted to Congress. The President’s 2007
Budget Proposal presented in January 2006 included cost savings from
competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services. The budget proposal did
not contain substantive details. ACLA, the trade association for the clinical
laboratory industry, issued a press release commenting negatively on the budget
proposal. Quest Diagnostics and ACLA will monitor the design and implementation
phase of the competitive bidding pilot and the Congressional reaction to the
2007 budget proposal.  The diagnostic
testing industry is concerned that the competitive bidding demonstrations or
nation-wide expansion of competitive bidding will not take into account all of
the factors involved in the timely delivery of high quality clinical laboratory
testing to a broad range of clients in diverse geographic settings.

In
December 2004, the State of Florida issued an Invitation to Negotiate (ITN)
seeking competitive bids for the provision of clinical laboratory tests on a
capitated-basis for some Medicaid recipients and on a reduced fee-for-service
basis for other Medicaid recipients. The ITN contemplates that the Florida
Medicaid Agency (AHCA) will negotiate with the three highest-scoring bidders for
an exclusive statewide contract of at least three years plus a potential
renewal period. ACLA, the industry trade association for clinical laboratories,
filed two petitions with AHCA challenging the ITN on public policy and legal
grounds. In addition, Quest Diagnostics and another large laboratory
independently filed bid protests with AHCA. On February 18, 2005, AHCA
announced, without further explanation, that it was withdrawing the ITN.  AHCA has not yet reissued its ITN. If
competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or national basis for
clinical laboratory testing, it could materially adversely affect the clinical
laboratory industry and us.

Future
Legislation.

Future changes in federal, state and local
regulations (or in the interpretation of current regulations) affecting
governmental reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing could adversely
affect us. We cannot predict, however, whether and what type of legislative
proposals will be enacted into law or what regulations will be adopted by
regulatory authorities.


Fraud
and Abuse Regulations.

Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback
laws prohibit clinical laboratories from making payments or furnishing other
benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to Medicare, Medicaid or
other federal programs.  As noted above,
the penalties for violation of these laws may include criminal and civil fines
and penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in federal
programs.  Many of the anti-fraud
statutes and regulations, including those relating to joint ventures and
alliances, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts.
We cannot predict if some of the fraud and abuse rules will be interpreted
contrary to our practices.

In
November 1999, the OIG issued an advisory opinion concluding that the industry
practice of discounting client bills may constitute a kickback if the
discounted price is below a laboratory’s overall cost (including overhead) and
below the amounts reimbursed by Medicare. Advisory opinions are not binding but
may be indicative of the position that prosecutors may take in enforcement
actions. The OIG’s opinion, if enforced, could result in fines and possible
exclusion and could require us to eliminate offering discounts to clients below
the rates reimbursed by Medicare. The OIG subsequently issued a letter
clarifying that it did not intend to imply that discounts are a per se
violation of the federal anti-kickback statute, but may merit further
investigation depending on the facts and circumstances presented.

In
addition, since 1992, a federal anti-“self-referral” law, commonly known as the
“Stark” law, prohibits, with certain exceptions, Medicare payments for
laboratory tests referred by physicians who have personally, or through a
family member, an investment interest in, or a compensation arrangement with,
the testing laboratory. Since January 1995, these restrictions have also
applied to Medicaid-covered services. Many states have similar anti-“self-referral”
and other laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals and
could also affect investment and compensation arrangements with physicians. We
cannot predict if some of the state laws will be interpreted contrary to our
practices.

In
April 2003, the OIG issued a Special Advisory Bulletin addressing what it
described as “questionable contractual arrangements” in contractual joint
ventures. The OIG Bulletin focused on arrangements where a healthcare provider,
or Owner, expands into a related healthcare business by contracting with a
healthcare provider, or Manager, that already is engaged in that line of
business for the Manager to provide related healthcare items or services to the
patients of the Owner in return for a share of the profits of the new line of
business. While we believe that the Bulletin is directed at “sham” arrangements
intended to induce referrals, we cannot predict whether the OIG might choose to
investigate all contractual joint ventures, including our joint ventures with
various hospitals or hospital systems.

Government
Investigations and Related Claims

We
are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws
and regulations. We believe that, based on our experience with government
settlements and public announcements by various government officials, the
federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare fraud. In
addition, legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give
federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding, powers and
remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse. Many of the regulations
applicable to us, including those relating to billing and reimbursement of
tests and those relating to relationships with physicians and hospitals, are
vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be
interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in
a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our
billing practices. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations,
we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, including the
loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other
federal and state healthcare programs and additional liabilities from third
party claims. In addition, certain federal and state statues, including the qui
tam provisions of the federal False Claim Act, allow private individuals to
bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private
payers alleging inappropriate billing practices.

During
the mid-1990s, Quest Diagnostics and SBCL settled significant government claims
that primarily involved industry-wide billing and marketing practices that both
companies believed to be lawful. The federal or state governments may bring
additional claims based on new theories as to our practices that we believe to
be in compliance with law. The federal government has substantial leverage in
negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the
rates at which we are reimbursed, and the government has the remedy of
excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, which represented approximately 18% of our net revenues
during 2005.

We
understand that there may be pending qui tam claims brought by former employees
or other “whistle blowers” as to which we have not been provided with a copy of
the complaint and accordingly cannot determine the extent of any potential
liability. We are also aware of certain pending lawsuits related to billing
practices filed under the qui tam provisions of the civil False Claims Act and
other federal and state statutes. These lawsuits include class action and
individual claims by patients arising out of the Company’s billing policies. In
addition, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary
course of business. Some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are
substantial in amount.


During
  the fourth quarter of 2004, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and Nichols Institute
  Diagnostics (NID), our test kit manufacturing subsidiary, each received a subpoena
  from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New
  York. Quest Diagnostics and NID have been cooperating with the United States
  Attorney’s Office. In connection with such cooperation, we have been providing
  information and producing various business records of NID and Quest Diagnostics,
  including documents related to testing and test kits manufactured by NID. This
  investigation by the United States Attorney’s Office could lead to civil
  and criminal damages, fines and penalties and additional liabilities from third
  party claims. In the second and third quarters of 2005, the FDA conducted an
  inspection of NID and issued a Form 483 listing the observations made by the
  FDA during the course of the inspection. NID is cooperating with the FDA and
  has filed its responses to the Form 483. Noncompliance with the FDA regulatory
  requirements or failure to take adequate and timely corrective action could
  lead to regulatory or enforcement action against NID and/or Quest Diagnostics,
  including, but not limited to, a warning letter, injunction, suspension of production
  and/or distribution, seizure or recall of products, fines or penalties, denial
  of pre-market clearance for new or changed products, recommendation against
  award of government contracts and criminal prosecution.

During
the second quarter of 2005, we received a subpoena from the United States
Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey. The subpoena seeks the
production of business and financial records regarding capitation and risk
sharing arrangements with government and private payers for the years 1993
through 1999. Also, during the third quarter of 2005, we received a subpoena
from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector
General. The subpoena seeks the production of various business records
including records regarding our relationship with health maintenance
organizations, independent physician associations, group purchasing
organizations, and preferred provider organizations from 1995 to the present. We
are cooperating with the United States Attorney’s Office and the Office of the
Inspector General.

Although
management cannot predict the outcome of such matters, management does not
anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, but may be material to our results
of operations and cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters
is determined or paid.

As
an integral part of our compliance program discussed below, we investigate all
reported or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare
reimbursement requirements. Any non-compliance that results in Medicare or
Medicaid overpayments is reported to the government and reimbursed by us. As a
result of these efforts, we have periodically identified and reported
overpayments. While we have reimbursed these overpayments and have taken
corrective action where appropriate, we cannot assure investors that in each
instance the government will necessarily accept these actions as sufficient.

Compliance Program

Compliance
with all government rules and regulations has become a significant concern
throughout the clinical laboratory industry because of evolving interpretations
of regulations and the emerging changes in laboratory science and healthcare
technology. We established a compliance program early in 1993.

We
emphasize the development of training programs intended to ensure the strict
implementation and observance of all applicable laws, regulations and Company
policies. Further, we conduct in-depth reviews of procedures, personnel and
facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations. The
Quality, Safety & Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors requires
periodic reporting of compliance operations from management.

We
seek to conduct our business in compliance with all statutes and regulations
applicable to our operations. Many of these statutes and regulations have not
been interpreted by the courts. We cannot assure investors that applicable
statutes or regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial,
regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect us.
Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes include significant
damages, penalties, and fines, exclusion from participation in governmental
healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and
authorization necessary to operate some or all of our business, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business.

Intellectual
Property Rights

Other
companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or
other property rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability
to develop, perform or sell our tests or operate our business. As a result, we
may be involved in intellectual property litigation and we may be found to
infringe on the proprietary rights of others, which could force us to do one or
more of the following:

•

cease developing, performing or selling products or
  services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

•

obtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the
  infringed intellectual property right;


Patents
generally are not issued until several years after an application is filed. The
possibility that, before a patent is issued to a third party, we may be
performing a test or other activity covered by the patent is not a defense to
an infringement claim. Thus, even tests that we develop could become the subject
of infringement claims if a third party obtains a patent covering those tests.

Infringement
and other intellectual property claims, regardless of their merit, can be
expensive and time-consuming to litigate. In addition, any requirement to reengineer
our tests or change our business processes could substantially increase our
costs, force us to interrupt product sales or delay new test releases. In the
past, we have settled several disputes regarding our alleged infringement of
intellectual property rights of third parties. We are currently involved in
settling several additional disputes. We do not believe that resolution of
these disputes will have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, infringement claims
could arise in the future as patents could be issued on tests or processes that
we may be performing, particularly in such emerging areas as gene-based testing
and other specialty testing.

Insurance

As
a general matter, providers of clinical laboratory testing services may be
subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims. Some of
these suits involve claims for substantial damages. Any professional liability
litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation.
We maintain various liability insurance coverages for claims that could result
from providing or failing to provide clinical laboratory testing services,
including inaccurate testing results and other exposures. Our insurance coverage limits our maximum
exposure on individual claims; however, we are essentially self-insured for a
significant portion of these claims. The basis for claims reserves considers
actuarially determined losses based upon our historical and projected loss
experience.  Management believes
that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently
estimated exposures. Although management cannot predict the outcome of any
claims made against the Company, management does not anticipate that the
ultimate outcome of any such proceedings or claims will have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition but may be material to our results of
operations and cash flows in the period in which the impact of such claims is
determined or paid. Similarly, although we believe that we will be able to
obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs, we cannot
assure you that we will be able to do so.

Employees

At
December 31, 2005, we employed approximately 41,500 people. This total excludes
employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority interest. We
have no collective bargaining agreements with any unions covering any employees
in the United States, and we believe that our overall relations with our
employees are good.


Item
1A. Risk Factors

Efforts
by third party payers, including the government, to reduce utilization and
pricing could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and
profitability.

Government
payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private payers and larger
employers have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the cost,
utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including clinical laboratory
services. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS (formerly the
Health Care Financing Administration) has, over the years, sought to control
clinical laboratory expenditures by the Medicare and Medicaid programs through
various means, including reimbursement rate reductions, measures designed to
control over-utilization by some physicians, and limited coverage policies. For
a more detailed description of the developments in government regulations, we
urge investors to read “Business - Regulation of Reimbursement for Clinical
Laboratory Services”.

In
November 2003, the House of Representatives and the United States Senate passed
a Medicare reform bill that includes a five-year freeze on adjustments to the
Medicare national fee schedule based on the consumer price index. Congressional
budget reconciliation efforts could result in further reductions in Medicare
and/or Medicaid expenditures for laboratory services in 2006. In addition, as
required by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act
of 2003 (MMA), CMS will conduct two demonstration projects of competitive
bidding for clinical laboratory services. The impact of competitive bidding on
our revenues is not known and is impossible to accurately predict. Furthermore,
on January 1, 2006, CMS began implementing Medicare Part D in accordance with
the MMA. CMS has projected that a sizeable percentage of traditional Medicare
beneficiaries will shift into new private health plans (Medicare Advantage). It
is not known and we cannot predict the impact that a shift from traditional
Medicare fee-for-service to Medicare Advantage may have on our revenues.

The
healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthcare
insurers, resulting in fewer but larger insurers with significant bargaining
power in negotiating fee arrangements with healthcare providers, including
clinical laboratories. These healthcare insurers, as well as independent
physician associations, demand that clinical laboratory service providers
accept discounted fee structures, or assume all or a portion of the financial
risk associated with providing testing services to their members through
capitated payment arrangements. Under capitated payment arrangements, clinical
laboratories receive a fixed monthly fee per enrolled individual for all laboratory
tests performed during the month, regardless of the number or cost of the tests
actually performed, although some services, such as various esoteric tests, new
technologies and anatomic pathology services, may be carved out from a
capitated arrangement. Services that are carved out from a capitated
arrangement are charged on a fee-for-service basis. We work closely with
healthcare insurers as they evaluate new tests; however, as innovation in the
testing area increases, there is no guarantee that healthcare insurers will
agree to offer new tests as a covered service, reimburse them at rates that
reflect the true cost or value associated with such services or carve out these
services from capitated arrangements.

Efforts
to impose reduced reimbursements and more stringent cost controls by government
and other payers may continue. If we cannot offset additional reductions in the
payments we receive for our services by reducing costs, increasing test volume
and/or introducing new procedures, our net revenues and profitability could be
materially adversely affected.

In
  September 2003, the Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, published a Notice
  of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that would amend the OIG’s exclusion regulations
  addressing claims containing “excessive charges”. Under the exclusion
  rule, the OIG has the authority to exclude a provider for submitting claims
  to Medicare that contain charges that are substantially in excess of the provider’s
  usual charges. The proposal would define “substantially in excess”
  and “usual charges” and clarify the “good cause” exception
  to the existing exclusion rule. We believe that the proposed regulation is flawed
  and are working with the American Clinical Laboratory Association, ACLA (our
  industry trade association), and a coalition of other healthcare providers to
  oppose this proposed regulation as drafted. If this regulation is adopted as
  proposed, it could potentially reduce the amounts reimbursed to us by Medicare
  and other federal payers or affect the fees charged to other payers by us. For
  additional information, see “Business - Regulation of Reimbursement for
  Clinical Laboratory Services”.


If we
fail to comply with extensive laws and regulations, we could suffer fines and
penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.

We
are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws
and regulations. We believe that, based on our experience with government
settlements and public announcements by various government officials, the
federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare fraud. In
addition, legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give
federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding, powers and
remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse. While we believe that we are in
material compliance with all applicable laws, many of the regulations
applicable to us, including those relating to billing and reimbursement of
tests and those relating to relationships with physicians and hospitals, are
vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be
interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in
a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our
pricing and/or billing practices. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and
regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties,
including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare,
Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs and additional
liabilities from third-party claims.

During
the mid-1990s, Quest Diagnostics and SBCL settled government claims that
primarily involved industry-wide billing and marketing practices that both
companies believed to be lawful. The aggregate amount of the settlements for
these claims exceeded $500 million. The federal or state governments may bring
additional claims based on new theories as to our practices that we believe to
be in compliance with law. The federal government has substantial leverage in
negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the
rates at which we are reimbursed, and the government has the remedy of
excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, which represented approximately 18% of our consolidated net
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005.

We
understand that there may be pending qui tam claims brought by former employees
or other “whistle blowers” as to which we have not been provided with a copy of
the complaint and accordingly cannot determine the extent of any potential
liability. We are also aware of certain pending lawsuits related to billing
practices filed under the qui tam provisions of the civil False Claims Act and
other federal and state statutes. These lawsuits include class action and
individual claims by patients arising out of the Company’s billing practices.
In addition, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business. Some of the proceedings against us involve claims
that are substantial in amount.

During
the fourth quarter of 2004, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and Nichols
Institute Diagnostics (NID), our test kit manufacturing subsidiary, each
received a subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern
District of New York. Quest Diagnostics and NID have been cooperating with the
United States Attorney’s Office. In connection with such cooperation, we have
been providing information and producing various business records of NID and
Quest Diagnostics, including documents related to testing and test kits
manufactured by NID. This investigation by the United States Attorney’s Office
could lead to civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties and additional
liabilities from third party claims. In the second and third quarters of 2005,
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of NID and
issued a Form 483 listing the observations made by the FDA during the course of
the inspection. NID is cooperating with the FDA and has filed its responses to
the Form 483. Noncompliance with the FDA regulatory requirements or failure to
take adequate and timely corrective action could lead to regulatory or
enforcement action against NID and/or Quest Diagnostics, including, but not
limited to, a warning letter, injunction, suspension of production and/or
distribution, seizure or recall of products, fines or penalties, denial of
pre-market clearance for new or changed products, recommendation against award
of government contracts, and criminal prosecution.

During
the second quarter of 2005, we received a subpoena from the United States
Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey. The subpoena seeks the
production of business and financial records regarding capitation and risk
sharing arrangements with government and private payers for the years 1993
through 1999. Also, during the third quarter of 2005, we received a subpoena
from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector
General. The subpoena seeks the production of various business records
including records regarding our relationship with health maintenance
organizations, independent physician associations, group purchasing
organizations, and preferred provider organizations from 1995 to the present.
We are cooperating with the United States Attorney’s Office and the Office of
the Inspector General.

Although
management cannot predict the outcome of such matters, management does not
anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, but may be material to our results
of operations and cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters
is determined or paid.


The
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) regulates virtually
all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal
government and comply with various operational, personnel and quality
requirements intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services
are accurate, reliable and timely. Furthermore, CLIA does not preempt state
laws that are more stringent than federal law. Some state laws may require
additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and/or
proficiency testing. Intentional and serious failures to comply with these
requirements can lead to loss of licenses, exclusion from the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, fines and other penalties.

Billing
and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to significant and
complex federal and state regulation. Penalties for violations of laws relating
to billing federal healthcare programs and for violations of federal fraud and
abuse laws include: (1) exclusion from participation in the Medicare/Medicaid
programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties;
and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary
to operate some or all of a clinical laboratory’s business. Civil monetary
penalties for a wide range of violations are not more than $10,000 per
violation plus three times the amount claimed and, in the case of kickback
violations, not more than $50,000 per violation plus up to three times the
amount of remuneration involved. A parallel civil remedy under the federal
False Claims Act provides for damages not more than $11,000 per violation plus
up to three times the amount claimed.

As
an integral part of our compliance program, we investigate all reported or
suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement
requirements. Any non-compliance that results in Medicare or Medicaid
overpayments is reported to the government and reimbursed by us. As a result of
these efforts, we have periodically identified and reported overpayments. While
we have reimbursed these overpayments and have taken corrective action where
appropriate, we cannot assure investors that in each instance the government
will necessarily accept these actions as sufficient.

Failure
in our information technology systems, including failures resulting from our
systems conversions or failures to adapt existing systems to proposed Health Information
Technology (HIT) standards, could significantly increase turnaround time,
otherwise disrupt our operations, or lead to increased competition by other
providers of laboratory services, all of which could reduce our customer base
and result in lost net revenues.

Information
systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business,
including laboratory testing, billing, customer service, logistics and
management of medical data. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and
uninterrupted performance of our information technology, or IT, systems. IT
systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including
telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural
disasters. Moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers are
potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses
and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have
taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems,
sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process
test orders, deliver test results or perform tests in a timely manner could
adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and net
revenues.

During
2002, we began implementation of a standard laboratory information system and a
standard billing system. The deployment of standardized systems is continuing
and we expect that it will take several years to complete and will result in
significantly more centralized systems than we have today. Failure to properly
implement this standardization process could materially adversely affect our
business. During system conversions of this type, workflow may be reengineered
to take advantage of enhanced system capabilities, which may cause temporary
disruptions in service. In addition, the implementation process, including the
transfer of databases and master files to new data centers, presents
significant conversion risks that need to be managed carefully.

In
addition, public and private initiatives at the federal, state and regional
levels to create HIT standards for the electronic exchange of clinical
information, including laboratory results, could require costly modifications
to our existing IT systems. While we do not expect HIT standards to be adopted
or implemented without adequate time to comply with new standards, failure or
delay in implementing HIT interoperability standards or in adopting and
incorporating standardized clinical coding systems in our IT systems, could
result in a loss of customers, a loss of business opportunities, and could
adversely affect our reputation. On October 11, 2005, the OIG and CMS published
separate NPRMs intended to create incentives to foster the quicker adoption of
HIT by physicians. The OIG issued a proposed “safe harbor” exception from the
federal anti-kickback laws for certain electronic e-prescribing arrangements
and CMS issued a virtually identical proposed exception to the federal
self-referral prohibition laws with regard to these same types of e-prescribing
arrangements. In addition, CMS issued proposed exceptions to the federal
self-referral prohibition laws with regard to certain Electronic Health Record
(EHR) arrangements. If these regulations are adopted as proposed, certain
providers other than clinical laboratories would be able to provide broader
packages of HIT items or services than laboratories which could create
incentives for some customers to choose such providers. We are commenting on
the proposed rules through our industry trade association, ACLA, reflecting our
position that if any providers are permitted to be donors of e-prescribing or
EHR items or services, then all providers should be entitled to the same
protections afforded by the proposed safe harbor and self-referral prohibition
exceptions.


Integrating
our operations with LabOne may be difficult and, if unsuccessfully executed,
may have a material adverse effect on our business.

On
November 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of LabOne in a transaction valued
at approximately $947 million, including approximately $138 million of assumed
debt of LabOne. LabOne reported revenues of $468 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The acquisition involves the integration of a separate
company that previously operated independently and has different systems,
processes and cultures. The process of combining LabOne with our operations may
be disruptive to both of our businesses and may cause an interruption of, or a
loss of momentum in, such businesses as a result of the following difficulties,
among others:

In
addition, because most of our clinical laboratory testing is performed under
arrangements that are terminable at will or on short notice, any such
interruption of or deterioration in our services may result in a customer’s
decision to stop using us for clinical laboratory testing. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to retain key technical and management personnel or that
we will realize the anticipated benefits of the LabOne acquisition, either at
all or in a timely manner. Additionally, as part of our growth strategy, we may
in the future acquire additional clinical laboratories or other
healthcare-related businesses, which could have integration risks.

The
acquisition of LabOne may not produce the anticipated benefits.

Even
if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of
LabOne, we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect
to result from such integration. We expect the acquisition to generate annual
synergies of approximately $30 million upon the completion of integration,
which is expected to occur within two years of closing. However, there can be
no assurance that such synergies will be realized.

Failure
to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse
effect on our net revenues and bad debt expense.

Billing
for laboratory services is extremely complicated. We provide testing services
to a broad range of healthcare providers. We consider a “payer” to be the party
that pays for the test and a “customer” to be the party who refers the test to
us. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we must bill
various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid,
physicians and employer groups, all of which have different billing
requirements. Additionally, auditing for compliance with applicable laws and
regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further
complexity to the billing process. Among many other factors complicating
billing are:

We
incur additional costs as a result of our participation in Medicare and
Medicaid programs, as billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing
is subject to considerable and complex federal and state regulations. These
additional costs include those related to: (1) complexity added to our billing
processes; (2) training and education of our employees and customers; (3)
compliance and legal costs; and (4) costs related to, among other factors,
medical necessity denials and advanced beneficiary notices. Compliance with
applicable laws and regulations, as well as internal compliance policies and
procedures, adds further complexity and costs to the billing process. Changes
in laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to bill our
clients. CMS establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements
changes to the reimbursement process.


We
believe that much of our bad debt expense, which was 4.2% of our net revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2005, is primarily the result of missing or
incorrect billing information on requisitions received from healthcare
providers and the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that
is their responsibility, rather than credit related issues. In general, we
perform the requested tests and report test results regardless of whether the
billing information is incorrect or missing. We subsequently attempt to contact
the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and
rectify incorrect billing information. Missing or incorrect information on
requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process, creates backlogs
of unbilled requisitions, and generally increases the aging of accounts
receivable and bad debt expense.

Our
outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility.

As
of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $1.6 billion of debt outstanding,
with approximately $740 million of available capacity under our senior
unsecured revolving credit facility and secured receivables credit facility.
Except for outstanding letters of credit and operating leases, we do not have
any off-balance sheet financing arrangements in place or available. See Note 10
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to our
outstanding debt. Set forth in the table below, for each of the next five
years, is the aggregate amount of scheduled principal, estimated interest and
total payments with respect to our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2005,
including capital leases, assuming that maturing debt is refinanced for
purposes of estimating interest.

Our
debt portfolio is sensitive to changes in interest rates. As of December 31,
2005, we had approximately $142 million of floating rate debt. Based on our net
exposure to interest rate changes, an assumed 10% change in interest rates on
our variable rate indebtedness (representing approximately 44 basis points) would
impact annual net interest expense by approximately $0.6 million, assuming no
changes to the debt outstanding at December 31, 2005. In addition, any future
borrowings by us under the unsecured revolving credit facility, the secured
receivables credit facility or the issuance of other floating rate debt will
expose us to additional interest rate risk. Interest rates on our unsecured
revolving credit facility, term loan and secured receivables credit facility
are also subject to a pricing schedule that fluctuates based on changes in our
credit rating.

Our
6¾% senior notes, which have an aggregate principal amount of $275 million
outstanding, mature in July 2006. We may repay the notes with cash on hand or
refinance the notes with borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit
facility, secured receivables credit facility or other financing arrangements.

Our
debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants. These restrictions could
limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business
because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest
payments on our debt.

We
have obtained ratings on our debt from Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s
Investors Service. There can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain
for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future
circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in
our company or our industry, so warrant. If such ratings are lowered, the
borrowing costs on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, secured
receivables facility and term loan would increase. Changes in our credit
ratings do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt.

We,
or our subsidiaries, may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our
ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to
generate cash in the future. If additional debt is added to our current debt, a
greater portion of our cash flows will be needed to satisfy our debt service
obligations; and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service
requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. In this case, it may be
more difficult, or we may be unable, to obtain financing on terms that are
acceptable to us. As a result, we would be more vulnerable to general adverse
economic, industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks
associated with indebtedness.


Professional liability litigation could have an adverse financial
  impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation.

As
  a general matter, providers of clinical laboratory testing services may be subject
  to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims. Some of these
  suits involve claims for substantial damages. Any professional liability litigation
  could have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation. We maintain
  various liability insurance programs for claims that could result from providing
  or failing to provide clinical laboratory testing services, including inaccurate
  testing results and other exposures. Our insurance coverage limits our maximum
  exposure on individual claims; however, we are essentially self-insured for
  a significant portion of these claims. The basis for claims reserves considers
  actuarially determined losses based upon our historical and projected loss experience.
  Management believes that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient
  to cover currently estimated exposures. Although management cannot predict the
  outcome of any claims made against the Company, management does not anticipate
  that the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings or claims will have a material
  adverse effect on our financial condition but may be material to our results
  of operations and cash flows in the period in which the impact of such claims
  is determined or paid. Similarly, although we believe that we will be able to
  obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs, we cannot
  assure you that we will be able to do so.

Failure
to provide a higher quality of service than that of our competitors could have
a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability.

While
there has been significant consolidation in recent years in the clinical
laboratory testing business, it remains a fragmented and highly competitive
industry. We believe that healthcare providers consider a number of factors
when selecting a laboratory, including:

We
believe that we compete favorably in each of these areas.

We
primarily compete with three types of laboratory providers—hospital-affiliated
laboratories, other independent clinical laboratories and physician-office
laboratories. Hospitals generally maintain an on-site laboratory to perform
testing on their patients. In addition, many hospitals compete with independent
clinical laboratories for outreach (non-hospital patients) testing. Most
physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as
part of their medical practice and many hospitals leverage their relationships
with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach
testing to the hospital’s laboratory. In addition, hospitals that own physician
practices generally require the physicians to refer tests to the hospital’s
laboratory. As a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community
physicians, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily based
on quality of service. Our failure to provide service superior to
hospital-affiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material
adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability.

Regulations
requiring the use of “standard transactions” for healthcare services issued
under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or
HIPAA, may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.

Pursuant
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA,
the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has
issued final regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information
in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy
and security of the information exchanged. Three principal regulations have
been issued in final form: standards for electronic transactions, security
regulations and privacy regulations.

The
HIPAA transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in
interpretation by payers. For instance, some payers may interpret the standards
to require us to provide certain types of information, including demographic
information not usually provided to us by physicians. While most of our
transactions are submitted and / or received in ANSI standard format,
inconsistent application of transaction standards by some remaining payers or
our inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to us
by physicians could increase our costs and the complexity of billing. In
addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims
attachments, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to
implement. We are working closely with our payers to establish acceptable
protocols for claims submissions and with our industry trade association and an
industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the
appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations.


Compliance
with the HIPAA security regulations and privacy regulations may increase our
costs.

The
HIPAA privacy and security regulations, which became fully effective in April
2003 and April 2005, respectively, establish comprehensive federal standards
with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by
health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition
to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability
of protected health information. The regulations establish a complex regulatory
framework on a variety of subjects, including:

We
have implemented practices to meet the requirements of the HIPAA privacy and security
regulations, as required by law. The privacy regulations establish a “floor”
and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are
required to comply with both federal privacy regulations and varying state
privacy laws. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries
relating to citizens of those countries, we must comply with the laws of those
other countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or
disclose patient-identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization,
for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined
by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other
permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. The privacy and
security regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for
wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information, including potential
civil and criminal fines and penalties. Although the HIPAA statute and
regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages, we also
could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or
disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal
information.

Compliance
with all of the HIPAA regulations, including new standard transactions,
requires ongoing resources from all healthcare organizations, not just Quest
Diagnostics. While we believe our total costs to comply with HIPAA will not be
material to our operations or cash flows, new standard transactions and
additional customer requirements resulting from different interpretations of
the current regulations could impose additional costs on us.

FDA
regulation of laboratory-developed tests, analyte specific reagents, or genetic
testing could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetic
tests.

The
FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and
other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories. In
the past, the FDA has claimed regulatory authority over laboratory-developed
tests, but has exercised enforcement discretion in not regulating tests
performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. In December 2000, the
HHS Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing recommended that the FDA
be the lead federal agency to regulate genetic testing. In late 2002, a new HHS
Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society, or SACGHS, was
appointed to replace the prior Advisory Committee. Ultimately, SACGHS decided
that it would continue to monitor the progress of the federal agencies in the
oversight of genetic technologies, but it did not believe that further action
was warranted. In the meantime, the FDA is considering revising its regulations
on analyte specific reagents, which are used in laboratory-developed tests,
including laboratory-developed genetic testing. Representatives of clinical
laboratories (including Quest Diagnostics) and the American Clinical Laboratory
Association (our industry trade association) have met with representatives of
the FDA to address industry issues pertaining to potential FDA regulation of
genetic testing in general and issues with regard to increased oversight over
the analyte specific reagents used in laboratory-developed tests in particular.
We expect those discussions to continue. FDA interest in or actual regulation
of laboratory-developed tests or increased regulation of the various medical
devices used in laboratory-developed testing could lead to periodic inquiry
letters from the FDA and increased costs and delays in introducing new tests,
including genetic tests.


The
development of new, more cost-effective tests that can be performed by
physicians in their offices or by patients could negatively impact our testing
volume and net revenues.

The
diagnostics testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product
introductions. Advances in technology may lead to the development of more
cost-effective tests that can be performed outside of an independent clinical
laboratory such as (1) point-of-care tests that can be performed by physicians
in their offices, (2) esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in
their own laboratories or (3) home testing that can be performed by patients in
their homes or by physicians in their offices. Development of such technology
and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratory-based
testing services and negatively impact our net revenues. Currently, most of our
clinical laboratory testing is categorized as “high” or “moderate” complexity,
and thereby subject to extensive and costly regulation, under CLIA.
Manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase
their sales by marketing point of care laboratory equipment to physicians and
by selling test kits approved for home use to both physicians and patients.
Diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for over the counter (OTC) or
prescription home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under CLIA
and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory
oversight as well as by patients in their homes. The FDA has regulatory
responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by
clinical laboratories and the Secretary of HHS has delegated to the FDA the
authority to determine whether particular tests (waived tests) are “simple” and
have “an insignificant risk of an erroneous result” under CLIA. Increased
approval of OTC or home test kits and/or increased numbers and types of waived
tests could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices, which
could affect our market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact
our net revenues.

Our
operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such
as hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism and other criminal
activities.

Our
operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such
as hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism or other criminal
activities. Such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of
patients who seek laboratory testing services. In addition, such events may
temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens or to receive
materials from our suppliers.

Our
tests and business processes may infringe on the intellectual property rights
of others, which could cause us to engage in costly litigation, pay substantial
damages or prohibit us from selling certain of our tests.

Other
companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or
other property rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability
to develop, perform or sell our tests or operate our business. As a result, we
may be involved in intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe
on the proprietary rights of others, which could force us to do one or more of
the following:

Patents
generally are not issued until several years after an application is filed. The
possibility that, before a patent is issued to a third party, we may be
performing a test or other activity covered by the patent is not a defense to
an infringement claim. Thus, even tests that we develop could become the
subject of infringement claims if a third party obtains a patent covering those
tests.

Infringement
and other intellectual property claims, regardless of their merit, can be
expensive and time-consuming to litigate. In addition, any requirement to
reengineer our tests or change our business processes could substantially
increase our costs, force us to interrupt product sales or delay new test
releases. In the past, we have settled several disputes regarding our alleged
infringement of intellectual property of third parties. We are currently
involved in settling several additional disputes. We do not believe that
resolution of these disputes will have a material adverse effect on our
operations or financial condition. However, infringement claims could arise in
the future as patents could be issued on tests or processes that we may be
performing, particularly in such emerging areas as gene-based testing and other
specialty testing.


Our
organizational documents and other agreements contain restrictions that might
prevent a takeover or change in management.

Provisions
of our articles of incorporation and by-laws might have the effect of
discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting a takeover on terms that some
shareholders might favor, reducing the opportunity for shareholders to sell
shares at a premium over then-prevailing market prices and prevent or frustrate
attempts to replace or remove current management. These provisions include:

In
addition, we have a shareholder rights plan, which grants shareholders other
than the acquiring person the right to purchase common stock at one-half of
market price if any person becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the
outstanding shares of common stock, subject to a number of exceptions set forth
in the plan.

2. Properties

Our principal laboratories (listed alphabetically by
state) are located in or near the following metropolitan areas. In certain
areas, we have more than one principal laboratory facility as a result of
recent acquisitions.

Our
executive offices are located at a leased facility in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. We
also lease a site in Norristown, Pennsylvania, that serves as a billing center;
a site in Tampa, Florida that serves as a billing call center; a site in Lee’s
Summit, Missouri that serves as a call center for our risk assessment services
business; a site in San Clemente, California, that serves as the main facility
for Nichols Institute Diagnostics; a site in Cincinnati that serves as the main
office for MedPlus; a site in Northgate, California that serves as an
administrative office for our clinical trials business; and we are in the
process of transitioning our operations to leased facilities in West Hills,
California, that will serve as our regional laboratory in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area. We also own an administrative office in Collegeville,
Pennsylvania, and a site in West Norriton, Pennsylvania, that serves as our
national data center. We own our laboratory facility in Mexico City, Mexico and
lease laboratory facilities in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Heston, England. We
believe that, in general, our laboratory facilities are suitable and adequate
for our current and anticipated future levels of operation. We believe that if
we were unable to renew a lease on any of our testing facilities, we could find
alternative space at competitive market rates and relocate our operations to
such new location.


Item
3. Legal Proceedings

In
addition to the investigations described in “Business – Government
Investigations and Related Claims”, we are involved in various legal
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of the proceedings
against us involve claims that are substantial in amount. Although we cannot
predict the outcome of such proceedings or any claims made against us, we do
not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of the various proceedings or claims
will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but may be
material to our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which the
impact of such matters is determined or paid.

SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA OF OUR COMPANY

The
following table summarizes selected historical financial data of our Company
and our subsidiaries at the dates and for each of the periods presented. We
derived the selected historical financial data for the years 2001 through 2005
from the audited consolidated financial statements of our Company. In April
2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 145, “Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections”, or SFAS 145. Pursuant to SFAS 145, extraordinary losses
associated with the extinguishment of debt in 2001, previously presented net of
applicable taxes, were reclassified to other non-operating expenses. In
September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a final consensus on
Issue 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted
Earnings per Share”, or Issue 04-8, effective December 31, 2004. Pursuant to
Issue 04-8, we included the dilutive effect of our 1¾% contingent convertible
debentures issued November 26, 2001 in our dilutive earnings per common share
calculations using the if-converted method, regardless of whether or not the
holders of these securities were permitted to exercise their conversion rights,
and retroactively restated previously reported diluted earnings per common
share. The selected historical financial data is only a summary and should be
read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and related
notes of our Company and management’s discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.



QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

Overview

The
underlying fundamentals of the diagnostic testing industry have improved since
the early to mid-1990s. Since that time there has been significant industry
consolidation, particularly among commercial laboratories, resulting in fewer
but larger commercial laboratories with greater economies of scale, better
equipped to service the members of large healthcare plans, and more disciplined
in their approach to operating their business. Orders for laboratory testing
are generated from physician offices, hospitals and employers. As such, factors
including changes in the United States economy which can affect the number of
unemployed and uninsured, and design changes in healthcare plans which impact
the number of physician office and hospital visits, can impact the utilization
of laboratory testing.

While
the diagnostic testing industry in the United States may be impacted by a
number of factors, we believe it will continue to grow over the long term as a
result of the following:

Quest
Diagnostics, as the largest clinical laboratory testing company with a leading
position in most of its domestic geographic markets and service offerings, is
well positioned to benefit from the growth expected in the industry.

Payments
for clinical laboratory testing services are made by the government, healthcare
insurers, physicians, hospitals, employers and patients. Physicians, hospitals
and employers are typically billed on a fee-for-service basis based on
negotiated fee schedules. Fees billed to patients and healthcare insurers are
based on the laboratory’s patient fee schedule, subject to any limitations on
fees negotiated with the healthcare insurers or with physicians on behalf of
their patients. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements are based on fee schedules
set by governmental authorities.

We
incur additional costs as a result of our participation in Medicare and
Medicaid programs, as billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing
is subject to considerable and complex federal and state regulations.
Compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as internal compliance
policies and procedures, adds further complexity and costs to our operations.
While the total cost to comply with Medicare administrative requirements is
disproportionate to our cost to bill other payers, average Medicare
reimbursement rates are not materially different than our overall average
reimbursement rate from all payers, making this business generally less
profitable. Government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as
healthcare insurers and larger employers have taken steps and may continue to
take steps to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare
services, including clinical laboratory services. Despite the added cost and
complexity of participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we continue
to participate in such programs because we believe that our other business may
depend, in part, on continued participation in these programs, since certain
customers may want a single laboratory capable of performing all of their
clinical laboratory testing services, regardless of who pays for such services.

Healthcare
insurers, including managed care organizations and other healthcare insurance
providers, which typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of
clinical laboratories on behalf of their members, represent approximately
one-half of our total testing volumes and one-half of our net revenues. Larger
healthcare insurers typically prefer to use large commercial clinical
laboratories because they can provide services to their members on a national
or regional basis. In addition, larger laboratories are better able to achieve
the low-cost structures necessary to profitably service the members of large
healthcare plans and can provide test utilization data across various products
in a consistent format. In certain markets, such as California, healthcare
insurers may delegate their covered


members to independent physician associations, or
IPAs, which in turn negotiate with laboratories for clinical laboratory
services on behalf of their members.

The
  trend of consolidation among healthcare insurers has continued, resulting in
  fewer but larger insurers with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee
  arrangements with healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. These
  healthcare insurers, as well as IPAs, demand that clinical laboratory service
  providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the
  financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through
  capitated payment arrangements. Under these capitated payment arrangements,
  we and healthcare insurers agree to a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate
  for each member of the healthcare insurer’s plan, regardless of the number
  or cost of services provided by us. Our cost to perform work reimbursed under
  capitated payment arrangements is not materially different from our cost to
  perform work reimbursed under other arrangements with healthcare insurers. Since
  average reimbursement rates under capitated payment arrangements are typically
  less than our overall average reimbursement rate, the testing services reimbursed
  under capitated payment arrangements are generally less profitable. In 2005,
  we derived approximately 17% of our testing volume and 7% of our net revenues
  from capitated payment arrangements. In recent years, healthcare insurers have
  begun to offer more freedom of choice to their members, including greater freedom
  to determine which laboratory to use and which tests to order. Accordingly,
  most of our agreements with major healthcare insurers are non-exclusive arrangements.
  As a result, under these non-exclusive arrangements, physicians and patients
  have more freedom of choice in selecting laboratories, and laboratories are
  likely to compete more on the basis of service and quality than they may otherwise.
  Also, healthcare plans are increasingly offering programs such as preferred
  provider organizations, or PPOs, and consumer driven health plans that offer
  a greater choice of healthcare providers. Pricing for these programs is typically
  negotiated on a fee-for-service basis, which generally results in higher revenue
  per requisition than under capitation arrangements. If consumer driven plans
  and PPO plans increase in popularity, it will be increasingly important for
  healthcare providers to differentiate themselves based on quality, service and
  convenience to avoid competing on price alone.

We
expect that reimbursements for the diagnostic testing industry will continue to
remain under pressure. Today, many federal and state governments face serious
budget deficits and healthcare spending is a prime target for reductions, and
efforts to reduce reimbursements and stringent cost controls by government and
other payers for existing tests may continue. However, we believe that as new
tests are developed which either improve on the effectiveness of existing tests
or provide new diagnostic capabilities, government and other payers will add
these tests as covered services, because of the importance of laboratory
testing in assessing and managing the health of patients. We continue to
emphasize the importance and the high value of laboratory testing with healthcare
insurers, and government payers at the federal and state level.

The
diagnostic testing industry is labor intensive. Employee compensation and
benefits constitute approximately one-half of our total costs and expenses.
Cost of services consists principally of costs for obtaining, transporting and
testing specimens. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist
principally of the costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts,
billing operations (including bad debt expense), and general management and
administrative support.

Information
systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business,
including laboratory testing, billing, customer service, logistics, and
management of medical data. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and
uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. Through proper
maintenance, staffing and investment in our information technology systems, we
expect to reduce the risks associated with our heavy reliance on these systems.

The
diagnostic testing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations in operating
results and cash flows. Typically, testing volume declines during the summer
months, year-end holiday periods and other major holidays, reducing net
revenues and operating cash flows below annual averages. Testing volume is also
subject to declines due to inclement weather or other events, which can deter
patients from having testing performed and which can vary in severity from year
to year.


Acquisition
of Lab

One,

Inc.

On
November 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Lab

One

, Inc., or LabOne

,

in an
all-cash transaction with a combined value of approximately $947 million, including
approximately $138 million of assumed debt of LabOne. See Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a full discussion of the LabOne acquisition.

Through
the acquisition, Quest Diagnostics acquired all of LabOne’s operations,
including its health screening and risk assessment services to life
insurance companies, as well as its clinical diagnostic testing services to
healthcare providers and drugs-of-abuse testing to employers. LabOne, with 2004
revenues of $468 million, has 3,100 employees and principal laboratories in
Lenexa, Kansas, as well as in Cincinnati, Ohio. We financed the acquisition and related transaction costs
together with the repayment of substantially all of LabOne’s debt outstanding
with proceeds from a $900 million private placement of senior notes, as
described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and from cash on
hand.

We
are in the process of finalizing our integration plans for LabOne and the
related costs of the integration. A significant portion of these costs is
expected to require cash outlays and is expected to primarily relate to
integration-related activities for 2006 and 2007, including the elimination of
excess capacity, operational realignment and workforce reductions. To the
extent that the costs relate to actions that impact the employees and
operations of LabOne, such costs will be accounted for as a cost of the
acquisition and will be included in goodwill. To the extent that the costs
relate to actions that impact Quest Diagnostics’ employees and operations, such
costs will be accounted for as a charge to earnings in the periods that the
integration plans are approved and communicated. We expect to finalize the
major components of our integration plans during the first quarter of 2006.

Upon
completion of the LabOne integration, we expect to realize approximately $30
million of annual synergies and we expect to achieve this annual rate of
synergies by the end of 2007.

Six
Sigma and Standardization Initiatives

We
intend to become recognized as the quality leader in the healthcare services
industry through utilizing a Six Sigma approach and Lean Six Sigma principles
to further increase the efficiency of our operations. Six Sigma is a management
approach that enhances quality and requires a thorough understanding of
customer needs and requirements, root cause analysis, process improvements and
rigorous tracking and measuring of key metrics. Lean Six Sigma streamlines
processes and eliminates waste. We have integrated our Six Sigma initiative
with our initiative to standardize our operations and processes through
adopting identified Company best practices. We plan to utilize Six Sigma and
continue these initiatives to drive growth by further differentiating us from
our competition, and to improve the efficiency of our operations.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make
estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect our
reported financial results and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities.

While
many operational aspects of our business are subject to complex federal, state
and local regulations, the accounting for our business is generally
straightforward with net revenues primarily recognized upon completion of the
testing process. Our revenues are primarily comprised of a high volume of
relatively low dollar transactions, and about one-half of our total costs and
expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits. Due to the nature of
our business, several of our accounting policies involve significant estimates
and judgments:


Revenues
and accounts receivable associated with clinical laboratory testing

The
process for estimating the ultimate collection of receivables associated with our clinical laboratory
testing involves significant assumptions and judgments. Billings for
services reimbursed by third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid, are
recorded as revenues net of allowances for differences between amounts billed
and the estimated receipts from such payers. Adjustments to the estimated
receipts, based on final settlement with the third-party payers, are recorded
upon settlement as an adjustment to net revenues.

We
have implemented a standardized approach to estimate and review the
collectibility of our receivables based on a number of factors, including the
period they have been outstanding. Historical collection and payer reimbursement
experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances
for doubtful accounts. In addition, we regularly assess the state of our
billing operations in order to identify issues, which may impact the
collectibility of receivables or allowance estimates. We believe that the
collectibility of our receivables is directly linked to the quality of our
billing processes, most notably those related to obtaining the correct
information in order to bill effectively for the services we provide. As such,
we have implemented “best practices” to reduce the number of requisitions that
we receive from healthcare providers with missing or incorrect billing
information. Revisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are
recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling, general and
administrative expenses. We believe that our collection and allowance
estimation processes, along with our close monitoring of our billing
operations, help to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to
reserve estimates. Less than 5% of our net accounts receivable as of December
31, 2005 were outstanding more than 150 days.

Healthcare
insurers

Healthcare
insurers, including managed care organizations, reimburse us for approximately
one-half of our net revenues. Reimbursements from healthcare insurers are based
on negotiated fee-for-service schedules and on capitated payment rates.

Receivables
due from healthcare insurers represent approximately 30% of our net accounts
receivable. Substantially all of the accounts receivable due from healthcare
insurers represent amounts billed under negotiated fee-for-service
arrangements. We utilize a standard approach to establish allowances for
doubtful accounts for such receivables, which considers the aging of the
receivables and results in increased allowance requirements as the aging of the
related receivables increases. Our approach also considers historical
collection experience and other factors. Collection of such receivables is
normally a function of providing complete and correct billing information to
the healthcare insurers within the various filing deadlines. For healthcare
insurers, collection typically occurs within 30 to 60 days of billing. Provided
healthcare insurers have been billed accurately with complete information prior
to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no
collection risk. If there has been a delay in billing, we determine if the
amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and if so, we will
reserve accordingly for the billing.

Approximately
7% of our net revenues are reimbursed under capitated payment arrangements in
which case the healthcare insurers typically reimburse us in the same month
services are performed, essentially giving rise to no outstanding accounts
receivable at month-end. If any capitated payments are not received on a timely
basis, we determine the cause and make a separate determination as to whether
or not the collection of the amount from the healthcare insurer is at risk and
if so, would reserve accordingly.

Government
payers

Payments
for clinical laboratory services made by the government are based on fee
schedules set by governmental authorities. Receivables due from government
payers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs represent approximately 15% of
our net accounts receivable. Collection of such receivables is normally a
function of providing the complete and correct billing information within the
various filing deadlines. Collection typically occurs within 30 days of
billing. Our processes for billing, collecting and estimating uncollectible
amounts for receivables due from government payers, as well as the risk of
non-collection, are substantially the same as those noted above for healthcare
insurers under negotiated fee-for-service arrangements.


Client
payers

Client
payers include physicians, hospitals, employers and other commercial
laboratories, and are billed based on a negotiated fee schedule. Receivables
due from client payers represent approximately 30% of our net accounts
receivable. Credit risk and ability to pay are more of a consideration for
these payers than healthcare insurers and government payers. We utilize a
standard approach to establish allowances for doubtful accounts for such
receivables, which considers the aging of the receivables and results in
increased allowance requirements as the aging of the related receivables
increase. Our approach also considers specific account reviews, historical
collection experience and other factors.

Patient
receivables

Patients
are billed based on established patient fee schedules, subject to any
limitations on fees negotiated with healthcare insurers or physicians on behalf
of the patient. Receivables due from patients represent approximately 25% of
our net accounts receivable. Collection of receivables due from patients is
subject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay. We utilize a
standard approach to establish allowances for doubtful accounts for such
receivables, which considers the aging of the receivables and results in
increased allowance requirements as the aging of the related receivables
increases. Our approach also considers historical collection experience and
other factors. Patient receivables are generally fully reserved for when the
related billing reaches 210 days outstanding. Balances are automatically
written off when they are sent to collection agencies. Reserves are adjusted
for estimated recoveries of amounts sent to collection agencies based on
historical collection experience, which is regularly monitored.

Reserves
for general and professional liability claims

As a general matter, providers of clinical
laboratory testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or
other similar legal claims. These suits could involve claims for substantial
damages. Any professional liability litigation could also have an adverse
impact on our client base and reputation. We maintain various liability
insurance coverages for claims that could result from providing or failing to
provide clinical laboratory testing services, including inaccurate testing
results and other exposures. Our insurance coverage limits our maximum exposure
on individual claims; however, we are essentially self-insured for a
significant portion of these claims. While the basis for claims reserves
considers actuarially determined losses based upon our historical and projected
loss experience, the process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve
estimates relative to these types of claims involves a high degree of judgment.
Changes in the facts and circumstances associated with claims could have a
material impact on our results of operations, principally costs of services,
and cash flows in the period that reserve estimates are revised or paid.
Although we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are
sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures, it is possible that we may
incur liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage or recorded reserves.

Reserves
for legal proceedings

Our
  business is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and
  local laws and regulations. We have previously entered into several settlement
  agreements with various government and private payers relating to industry-wide
  billing and marketing practices that had been substantially discontinued by
  the mid-1990s. In addition, we are aware of certain pending lawsuits related
  to billing practices filed under the qui tam provisions of the civil False Claims
  Act and other federal and state statutes. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
  Statements for a discussion of the various legal proceedings that involve the
  Company. We have a comprehensive compliance program that is intended to ensure
  the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws, regulations
  and Company policies. The Quality, Safety & Compliance Committee of the
  Board of Directors requires periodic reporting of compliance operations from
  management. As an integral part of our compliance program, we investigate all
  reported or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement
  requirements. Any non-compliance that results in Medicare or Medicaid overpayments
  is reported to the government and reimbursed by us. As a result of these efforts,
  we have periodically identified and reported overpayments. Upon becoming aware
  of potential overpayments, we will consider all available facts and circumstances
  to estimate and record the amounts to be reimbursed. While we have reimbursed
  these overpayments and have taken corrective action where appropriate, we cannot
  assure investors that in each instance the government will necessarily accept
  these actions as sufficient.

The
process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to
legal proceedings involves a high degree of judgment. Changes in facts and
circumstances related to such proceedings could lead to significant revisions
to reserve estimates for such matters and could have a material impact on our
results of operations and cash flows in the period that reserve estimates are
revised or paid

.


Management
has established reserves for legal proceedings in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Although management cannot predict the outcome
of such matters, management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of
such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
condition but may be material to the Company’s results of operations or cash
flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid.
However, we understand that there may be pending qui tam claims brought by
former employees or other “whistle blowers”, or other pending claims as to
which we have not been provided with a copy of the complaint and accordingly
cannot determine the extent of any potential liability

.

Accounting for and recoverability of goodwill

Goodwill
is our single largest asset. We evaluate the recoverability and measure
the potential impairment of our goodwill under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. The
annual impairment test is a two-step process that begins with the estimation of
the fair value of the reporting unit. The first step screens for potential
impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment, if any.
Our estimate of fair value considers publicly available information regarding
the market capitalization of our Company, as well as (i) publicly available
information regarding comparable publicly-traded companies in the clinical
laboratory testing industry, (ii) the financial projections and future
prospects of our business, including its growth opportunities and likely
operational improvements, and (iii) comparable sales prices, if available. As
part of the first step to assess potential impairment, we compare our estimate
of fair value for the reporting unit to the book value of the reporting unit.
If the book value is greater than our estimate of fair value, we would then
proceed to the second step to measure the impairment, if any. The second step
compares the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value. The
implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting
unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit
had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting
unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of
the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets
and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount
of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value, an
impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess. We believe our
estimation methods are reasonable and reflect common valuation practices.

On
a quarterly basis, we perform a review of our business to determine if events
or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse
effect on the fair value of the Company and its goodwill. If such events or
changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred, we would perform an
impairment test of goodwill as of the end of the quarter, consistent with the
annual impairment test performed at the end of our fiscal year on December 31

st

,
and record any noted impairment loss.

Results of Operations

Our
  clinical laboratory testing business currently represents our one reportable
  business segment. The clinical laboratory testing business accounts for approximately
  95% of consolidated net revenues in each of the three years ended December 31,
  2005. Our other operating segments include our non-clinical laboratory testing
  businesses and consist of our risk assessment services business, our clinical
  trials testing business, our test kit manufacturing subsidiary, NID, and our
  healthcare information technology business, MedPlus. Our business segment information
  is disclosed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Year
Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2004

Net
income for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased to $546 million, or $2.66
per diluted share, compared to $499 million, or $2.35 per diluted share in
2004. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to organic revenue
growth, and increases in operating efficiencies in our clinical testing
business resulting from our Six Sigma and standardization efforts, in addition
to efficiencies resulting from increased use of electronic ordering by
physicians. Partially offsetting the increase was the performance at our test
kit manufacturing subsidiary, NID, which reduced consolidated revenue growth
and earnings per share growth by 0.2% and $0.16 per share, respectively,
compared to the prior year. The impact of NID and our plans for that business
are discussed in greater detail under

NID

.

Net
Revenues

Net
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 grew by 7.4% over the prior year
level to $5.5 billion. The acquisition of LabOne, which was completed on
November 1, 2005, contributed 1.7% of the consolidated revenue growth.
Approximately 55% of LabOne’s net revenues are generated from risk assessment
services provided to life insurance companies, with the remainder classified as
clinical laboratory testing.

Our
clinical testing business, which accounted for over 95% of our 2005
consolidated net revenues, grew approximately 7.0% for the year. The
acquisition of LabOne contributed approximately 1% to the growth in clinical
laboratory testing net revenues, principally reflected in volume. The increase
in clinical testing revenues was driven by improvements in both testing
volumes, measured by the number of requisitions, and increases in average
revenue per requisition.


For
the year ended December 31, 2005, clinical testing volume increased 4.4%
compared to the prior year period.

For
the year ended December 31, 2005, average revenue per requisition improved
2.3%. These improvements are primarily attributable to a continuing shift in
test mix to higher value testing, including gene-based and esoteric testing,
and increases in the number of tests ordered per requisition. Gene-based
testing net revenues were over $660 million for 2005, and grew approximately
10% compared to the prior year.Although LabOne’s clinical testing business carries a lower
revenue per requisition than our average, principally due to a higher
concentration of lower priced drugs-of-abuse testing, the acquisition of LabOne
did not have a significant impact on our average revenue per requisition.
Management continues to expect that average revenue per requisition will
typically grow approximately 2% in a given year, with some fluctuations on a
quarter-to-quarter basis.

Our
  businesses other than clinical laboratory testing accounted for approximately
  5% of our consolidated net revenues in 2005. These businesses include our clinical
  trials testing business, and our healthcare information technology business
  (MedPlus), whose growth rates did not significantly affect our consolidated
  growth rate. In addition, we consider the risk assessment business acquired
  in the LabOne acquisition and NID to be non-clinical laboratory testing businesses.
  As discussed elsewhere, NID’s net revenues were approximately 1% of consolidated
  net revenues in 2005; however, due to two product holds, NID’s net revenues
  were below the prior year level, and reduced consolidated revenue growth by
  0.2%. We expect that NID’s net revenues will represent less than 1% of
  our consolidated net revenues in 2006. The risk assessment business currently
  generates approximately $280 million in annual revenues and has been growing
  approximately 3% per year. The net revenues from this business for the two months
  we owned it during 2005, contributed just under 1% to consolidated revenue growth.
  We expect that this business will represent approximately 4% of our consolidated
  net revenues in 2006, bringing the total net revenues attributable to our non-clinical
  laboratory testing businesses to approximately 8% of our consolidated net revenues.

Operating
Costs and Expenses

Total
operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased
$300 million from the prior year period primarily due to organic growth in our
clinical testing volume and, to a lesser degree, the LabOne acquisition. The
increased costs were primarily in the areas of employee compensation and
benefits, and testing supplies. While our cost structure has been favorably
impacted by efficiencies generated from our Six Sigma and standardization
initiatives, we continue to make investments in sales, service, science and
information technology to further differentiate our company. These investments
include:

Additionally,
costs incurred at NID associated with completing its quality review and
cooperating with an ongoing government investigation and regulatory review have
served to increase operating costs over the prior year and are impacting costs
of services and selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of
net revenues.

Cost
of services, which includes the costs of obtaining, transporting and testing
specimens, was 59.2% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005,
increasing from 58.3% of net revenues in the prior year period. The increase
over the prior year is primarily due to the impact of NID’s results, and the
addition of the LabOne business, which carries a higher cost of sales
percentage than the Company average. Also serving to increase cost of services
as a percentage of net revenues for the year is increased costs of testing
supplies, initial installation costs associated with deploying our
Internet-based orders and results systems in physicians’ offices, and an
increase in phlebotomists to


support an increasing percentage of our volume collected in our
  patient service centers and by phlebotomists we have in physicians’ offices.
  At December 31, 2005, approximately 45% of our orders were being transmitted
  via the Internet. The increase in the number of orders received through our
  Internet-based systems is (i) improving the initial collection of billing information
  which is reducing the cost of billing and bad debt expense, both of which are
  components of selling, general and administrative expenses, and (ii) reducing
  the cost associated with specimen processing, which is included in cost of services.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses, which include the costs of the sales
force, billing operations, bad debt expense and general management and
administrative support, were 22.9% of net revenues during the year ended
December 31, 2005, decreasing from 23.9% in the prior year period. These
improvements were primarily due to revenue growth, which has allowed us to
leverage our expense base, as well as continued benefits from our Six Sigma and
standardization initiatives.  The
financial results of NID served to reduce the improvement for the year by
approximately 0.3%. For the year ended December 31, 2005, bad debt expense was
4.2% of net revenues, compared to 4.4% in the prior year period. This decrease
primarily relates to the improved collection of diagnosis, patient and
insurance information necessary to more effectively bill for services
performed. We believe that our Six Sigma and standardization initiatives and
the increased use of electronic ordering by our customers will provide
additional opportunities to further improve our overall collection experience
and cost structure.

Other
operating expense (income), net represents miscellaneous income and expense
items related to operating activities, including gains and losses associated
with the disposal of operating assets. For the year ended December 31, 2005,
other operating expense (income), net includes a $6.2 million charge primarily
related to forgiveness of amounts owed by patients and physicians, and related
property damage as a result of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast, and the write-off
of $7.5 million of goodwill associated with NID. For the year ended December 31, 2004, other
operating expense (income), net includes a $10.3 million charge associated with
the acceleration of certain pension obligations in connection with the
succession of the Company’s prior CEO.

Operating
Income

Operating
income for the year ended December 31, 2005 improved to $968 million, or 17.6%
of net revenues, from $891 million, or 17.4% of net revenues, in the prior year
period. The increases in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2005
were principally driven by revenue growth and continued benefits from our Six
Sigma and standardization initiatives. Operating income as a percentage of
revenues compared to the prior year was reduced by approximately 1% due to the
performance at NID, and by 0.2% due to LabOne’s lower margins.

Other
Income (Expense)

Interest
expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2005 approximated the prior year
level. The redemption of our contingent convertible debentures in January 2005
and increased interest income principally served to reduce net interest expense
in 2005, which was offset by the interest expense related to the financing of
the LabOne acquisition. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31,
2004 included a $2.9 million charge representing the write-off of deferred
financing costs associated with the second quarter 2004 refinancing of our bank
debt and credit facility.

Other,
net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to non-operating
activities such as gains and losses associated with investments and other
non-operating assets. For the year ended December 31, 2005, other, net includes
a $7.1 million charge associated with the write-down of an investment.

NID

NID
  is the Company’s test kit manufacturing subsidiary, which prior to two
  product holds initiated during 2005, accounted for about 1% of consolidated
  net revenues. During the fourth quarter of 2005, NID instituted its second product
  hold due to quality issues. The hold remains in effect for substantially all
  of NID’s products while NID works to address the issues and return product
  to market. The latest product hold has caused us to reevaluate the financial
  outlook for NID. As a result of this analysis we recorded a pre-tax charge of
  $16 million ($0.06 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter to write off certain
  of NID’s assets. The charge includes the write-off of all of the goodwill
  associated with NID of $7.5 million, which is included in other operating expense
  (income), net, and other write-offs totaling $8.5 million, principally related
  to products and equipment inventory, which are included in cost of services.
  In addition, during the second quarter, in connection with its first product
  hold, NID recorded a charge of approximately $3 million, principally related
  to products and equipment inventory. These charges, coupled with the


operating losses at NID stemming from the product
holds, together with the costs to rectify NID’s quality issues and comply with
an ongoing government investigation and regulatory review of NID, have reduced
pre-tax earnings compared to the prior year by approximately $50 million or
$0.16 per diluted share.

While
NID is continuing to work to address its quality issues and return products to
market, we are also evaluating all of our strategic options for NID, including
but not limited to repositioning NID as a smaller more narrowly focused
business, selling some or all of the assets of NID, or exiting the business.
Although we expect that the negative impact of NID on the Company’s financial
performance will be for a finite period, we cannot estimate at this time how
long a period it will be, even after we decide which strategic option we will
select. We currently expect to finalize our plans for NID before the end of the
second quarter of 2006, at which time we expect to be in a position to estimate
the financial impact, including potential restructuring and other charges,
resulting from our decision.

The
ongoing government investigation and regulatory review of NID continue. While
we do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse impact on our
overall financial condition, their final resolution could be material to our
results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such
matters is determined or paid. Please refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies” for a further description
of these matters.

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared with Year
Ended
December 31, 2003

Net
income for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased to $499 million, or $2.35
per diluted share, from $437 million, or $2.02 per diluted share, for the prior
year period. This increase in earnings was primarily attributable to revenue
growth and efficiencies generated from our Six Sigma and standardization
initiatives, partially offset by investments in our operations. For the year
ended December 31, 2004, the increase in earnings was partially offset by the
impact of $13.2 million in pre-tax charges recorded in the second quarter of
2004. Included in the second quarter charges was $10.3 million related to the
acceleration of certain pension obligations in connection with the succession
of our prior CEO with the remaining $2.9 million representing the write-off of
deferred financing costs associated with a refinancing. These charges served to
reduce reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 by $7.9 million
and reduced basic and diluted earnings per common share by $0.08.

Net
Revenues

Net
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 grew by 8.2% over the prior year
level. Including twelve months of Unilab Corporation’s, or Unilab’s, results in
2004 (which was acquired on February 28, 2003), versus ten months of Unilab’s
results in the prior year, contributed 1.5% to consolidated revenue growth. The
increase in net revenues was primarily driven by improvements in testing
volumes and increases in average revenue per requisition. Pro forma revenue
growth was 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004, assuming that the Unilab
acquisition and the related sale of certain assets in northern California, or
the Divestiture, had been completed on January 1, 2003. See Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a full discussion of the Unilab
acquisition and the Divestiture.

For
the year ended December 31, 2004, clinical testing volume, measured by the
number of requisitions, increased 5.0% compared to the prior year period. On a
pro forma basis, assuming that the Unilab acquisition and the Divestiture had
been completed on January 1, 2003, testing volume increased 3.2% for the year
ended December 31, 2004.

Average
revenue per requisition improved 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared to the prior year period. This improvement is primarily attributable
to a continuing shift in test mix to higher value testing, including gene-based
testing, and increases in the number of tests ordered per requisition. These
factors are expected to continue as the primary drivers of increases in revenue
per requisition, although to a lesser extent than the past several years.
Gene-based testing net revenues approximated $600 million for 2004, and grew
over 10% compared to the prior year.The inclusion of Unilab’s results subsequent to February 28,
2003 served to reduce average revenue per requisition by 0.4% for the year
ended December 31, 2004, reflecting Unilab’s lower revenue per requisition.

Drugs-of-abuse
testing, which is among our lowest priced services and accounts for
approximately 6% of our volume and 3% of our consolidated net revenues, grew
for the first year after several years of decline. However, growth in this
business remained below that for our consolidated business.


Our
businesses other than clinical laboratory testing, which represent
approximately 4% of our consolidated net revenues, grew approximately 20%
during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the prior year period, and
contributed about one-half of a percent to reported net revenue growth.

Operating
Costs and Expenses

Total
operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased
$294 million from the prior year period primarily due to increases in our
clinical testing volume. The increased costs were primarily in the areas of
employee compensation and benefits and testing supplies. While our cost
structure has been favorably impacted by efficiencies generated from our Six
Sigma and standardization initiatives, we continue to make investments in
sales, service, science and information technology to further differentiate our
company. These investments include:

Cost
of services, which includes the costs of obtaining, transporting and testing
specimens, was 58.3% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004,
decreasing from 58.4% of net revenues in the prior year period. This
improvement was primarily the result of the increase in average revenue per
requisition and efficiency gains resulting from our Six Sigma and
standardization initiatives. This improvement was partially offset by initial
installation costs associated with deploying our Internet-based orders and
results systems in physicians’ offices and an increase in the number of
phlebotomists in our patient service centers to support an increasing
percentage of our volume generated from these sites. At December 31, 2004,
approximately 40% of our orders and 60% of our test results were being
transmitted via the Internet. The increase in the number of orders and test
results reported via our Internet-based systems is improving the initial
collection of billing information which is reducing the cost of billing and bad
debt expense, both of which are components of selling, general and
administrative expenses. Additionally, we believe that the number of physicians
who no longer draw blood in their offices continues to increase, which is
resulting in an increase in the number of blood draws in our patient service
centers and by our phlebotomists placed in physicians’ offices. This shift has
increased our operating costs associated with our blood draws, but is reducing
costs in accessioning and other parts of our operations due to improved billing
information, and a reduction in the number of inadequate patient samples
because our phlebotomists are specifically trained in these areas.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses, which include the costs of the sales
force, billing operations, bad debt expense and general management and
administrative support, was 23.9% of net revenues during the year ended
December 31, 2004, decreasing from 24.6% in the prior year period. This
improvement was primarily due to efficiencies from our Six Sigma and
standardization initiatives and the improvement in average revenue per
requisition. Partially offsetting these improvements are additional costs for
expanding our sales force and enhancing their training. During 2004, bad debt
expense improved to 4.4% of net revenues, compared to 4.8% in the prior year
period. This decrease primarily relates to the improved collection of
diagnosis, patient and insurance information necessary to more effectively bill
for services performed. We believe that our Six Sigma and standardization
initiatives and the increased use of electronic ordering by our customers will
provide additional opportunities to further improve our overall collection
experience and cost structure.

Other
operating expense (income), net represents miscellaneous income and expense
items related to operating activities, including gains and losses associated
with the disposal of operating assets. For the year ended December 31, 2004, other
operating expense (income), net includes a $10.3 million second quarter charge
associated with the acceleration of certain pension obligations in connection
with the succession of our prior CEO. For the year


ended December 31, 2003, other operating expense (income), net
includes $3.3 million of gains on the sale of certain operating assets,
partially offset by a $1.1 million charge associated with the integration of
Unilab.

Operating
Income

Operating
income for the year ended December 31, 2004 improved to $891 million, or 17.4%
of net revenues, from $796 million, or 16.8% of net revenues, in the prior year
period. The increase in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2004
was principally driven by revenue growth and efficiencies generated from our
Six Sigma and standardization initiatives, which have reduced both the cost of
services and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
net revenues. Partially offsetting these improvements were investments in our
operations and a charge in the second quarter of 2004 of $10.3 million
associated with the succession of our prior CEO. This charge reduced operating
income, as a percentage of net revenues, by 0.2% for the year ended December
31, 2004.

Other
Income (Expense)

Interest
expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased from the prior year
period primarily due to a reduction in borrowing costs associated with our 2004
refinancing. In addition, interest expense, net for 2004 included a $2.9
million second quarter charge representing the write-off of deferred financing
costs associated with the refinancing of our bank debt and credit facility. Our
2004 debt refinancing, which was done to take advantage of the improved lending
environment and our improved credit profile, is discussed further in Note 10 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other,
net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to non-operating
activities such as gains and losses associated with investments and other
non-operating assets.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We
address our exposure to market risks, principally the market risk of changes in
interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that may
include the use of derivative financial instruments. In October 2005, we
entered into interest rate lock agreements with two financial institutions for
a total notional amount of $300 million to lock the U.S. treasury bond rate
component of a portion of our offering of debt securities later that same
month. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes. We do not believe that our foreign exchange exposure is material to
our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our financial
instruments and hedging activities.  See
Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our
treasury lock agreements.

At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair value of our debt was estimated at
approximately $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, using quoted market
prices and yields for the same or similar types of borrowings, taking into
account the underlying terms of the debt instruments. At December 31, 2005 and
2004, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the debt by
approximately $39 million and $84 million, respectively. An assumed 10%
increase in interest rates (representing approximately 59 and 45 basis points
at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively) would potentially reduce the
estimated fair value of our debt by approximately $36 million and $17 million
at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Borrowings
under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, our secured receivables
credit facility and our term loan due December 2008, are subject to variable interest
rates. Interest on our secured receivables credit facility is based on rates
that are intended to approximate commercial paper rates for highly rated
issuers. Interest rates on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and
term loan due December 2008 are subject to a pricing schedule that can
fluctuate based on changes in our credit ratings. As such, our borrowing cost
under these credit arrangements will be subject to both fluctuations in
interest rates and changes in our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2005, our
borrowing rate for our LIBOR-based loans was LIBOR plus 0.5%. At December 31,
2005, there was $60 million of borrowings outstanding under our $300 million
secured receivables credit facility, $75 million outstanding under our term loan
due December 2008 and no borrowings outstanding under our $500 million senior
unsecured revolving credit facility. Based on our net exposure to interest rate
changes, an assumed 10% change in interest rates on our variable rate
indebtedness (representing approximately 44 basis points) would impact annual
net interest expense by approximately $0.6 million, assuming no changes to the
debt outstanding at December 31, 2005.See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details
regarding our debt outstanding.


Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash
and cash equivalents at December 31, 2005 totaled $92 million, compared to $73
million at December 31, 2004. Cash flows from operating activities in 2005 were
$852 million, which together with cash flows from financing activities of $247
million, were used to fund investing activities of $1.1 billion. Cash and cash
equivalents at December 31, 2004 totaled $73 million, compared to $155 million
at December 31, 2003. Cash flows from operating activities in 2004 provided
cash of $799 million, which together with cash on hand were used to fund
investing and financing activities, which required cash of $174 million and
$707 million, respectively.

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities

Net
cash provided by operating activities for 2005 was $852 million compared to
$799 million in the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to improved operating performance and a
smaller increase in net accounts receivable compared to the prior year,
partially offset by the timing and net amount of various payments for taxes.
Days sales outstanding, a measure of billing and collection efficiency,
improved to 46 days at December 31, 2005 from 47 days at December 31, 2004.

Net
cash provided by operating activities for 2004 was $799 million compared to
$663 million in the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to
improved operating performance and increased tax benefits associated with stock-based
compensation plans, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable
associated with growth in net revenues. Days sales outstanding, a measure of
billing and collection efficiency, improved to 47 days at December 31, 2004
from 48 days at December 31, 2003.

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities

Net
cash used in investing activities in 2005 was $1.1 billion, consisting primarily of the acquisition of
LabOne and related transaction costs for $795 million, the acquisition of a
small regional laboratory for $19 million, equity investments of $38 million in
companies which develop diagnostic tests, and capital expenditures of $224
million.

Net
cash used in investing activities in 2004 was $174 million, consisting primarily
of capital expenditures of $176 million.

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities

Net
cash provided by financing activities in 2005 was $247 million, consisting
primarily of proceeds from borrowings of $1.1 billion and $98 million in proceeds
from the exercise of stock options, reduced by repayments of debt totaling $497
million, purchases of treasury stock totaling $390 million and dividend
payments of $70 million. Proceeds from borrowings consisted primarily of $892
million net proceeds from the private placement of $900 million of senior
notes, or the 2005 Senior Notes, used to finance the acquisition of LabOne and
$200 million of borrowings under our secured receivable credit facility to fund
the repayment of $100 million of principal outstanding under our senior
unsecured revolving credit facility and seasonal cash flow requirements. During
2005, we repaid $270 million of borrowings associated with our secured
receivables credit facility and $100 million of principal outstanding under our
senior unsecured revolving credit facility. In addition, we repaid
approximately $127 million of principal, representing substantially all of
LabOne’s outstanding debt that was assumed by us in connection with the LabOne
acquisition. At December 31, 2005, we had $60 million outstanding, and $740
million of available borrowing capacity under our combined credit facilities.
Our credit facilities and the 2005 Senior Notes, along with our other debt
outstanding are more fully described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. The $390 million in treasury stock purchases represents 7.8 million
shares of our common stock purchased at an average price of $49.98 per share.

Net cash used in financing activities in 2004 was $707
million, consisting primarily of purchases of treasury stock totaling $735
million and dividend payments totaling $61 million, partially offset by $109
million received from the exercise of stock options. In addition, we repaid the
remaining $305 million of principal outstanding under our term loan due June
2007 with $100 million of borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving
credit facility, $130


million of borrowings under our secured receivables
credit facility and $75 million of borrowings under our term loan due December
2008. The $735 million in treasury stock purchases represents 16.7 million
shares of our common stock purchased at an average price of $44.11 per share.

Stock
Split

On
June 20, 2005, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split through the
issuance of a stock dividend of one new share of common stock for each share of
common stock held by stockholders of record on June 6, 2005. References to
previously reported number of common shares and per common share amounts
including earnings per common share calculations and related disclosures, have
been restated to give retroactive effect to the stock split for all periods
presented.

Dividend
Policy

During
each of the quarters of 2005 and 2004, our Board of Directors has declared a
quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 and $0.075 per common share, respectively. On
January 26, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend per
common share of $0.10, payable on April 19, 2006, to shareholders of record on
April 5, 2006.  We expect to fund future
dividend payments with cash flows from operations, and do not expect the
dividend to have a material impact on our ability to finance future growth.

Share
Repurchase Plan

For
the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased approximately 7.8 million
shares of our common stock at an average price of $49.98 per share for $390
million. Through December 31, 2005, we have repurchased approximately 32.4
million shares of our common stock at an average price of $42.61 for $1.4
billion under our share repurchase program. At December 31, 2005, the total
available for repurchases under the remaining authorizations was $122 million.
In January 2006, our Board of Directors expanded the share repurchase authorization
by an additional $600 million, bringing the total amount authorized and
available for repurchases to $722 million.

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments

The
following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of
December 31, 2005. See Notes 10 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for further details.

See
Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of the
terms of our indebtedness and related debt service requirements. A full
discussion and analysis regarding our minimum rental commitments under
noncancelable operating leases, noncancelable commitments to purchase products
or services, and reserves with respect to insurance and other legal matters is
contained in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During
2005, we had two lines of credit with two financial institutions totaling $75
million for the issuance of letters of credit, which were renewed and increased
to a total of $85 million in December 2005. Standby letters of credit are
obtained, principally in support of our risk management program, to ensure our
performance or payment to third parties and amounted to $69 million at December
31, 2005, all of which was issued against the $85 million letter of credit
lines. The letters of credit, which are renewed annually, primarily represent
collateral for automobile liability and workers’ compensation loss payments.

Our
credit agreements relating to our senior unsecured revolving credit facility
and our term loan due December 2008 contain various covenants and conditions,
including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, that


could impact our ability to, among other things, incur
additional indebtedness. We do not expect these covenants to adversely impact
our ability to execute our growth strategy or conduct normal business
operations.

Unconsolidated
Joint Ventures

We
have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in Phoenix, Arizona;
Indianapolis, Indiana; and Dayton, Ohio, which are accounted for under the
equity method of accounting. We believe that our transactions with our joint
ventures are conducted at arm’s length, reflecting current market conditions
and pricing. Total net revenues of our unconsolidated joint ventures equal less
than 6% of our consolidated net revenues. Total assets associated with our
unconsolidated joint ventures are less than 2% of our consolidated total
assets. We have no material unconditional obligations or guarantees to, or in
support of, our unconsolidated joint ventures and their operations.

Requirements
and Capital Resources

We
estimate that we will invest approximately $225 million to $245 million during
2006 for capital expenditures to support and expand our existing operations,
principally related to investments in information technology, equipment, and
facility upgrades.

We
believe that cash from operations and our borrowing capacity under our credit
facilities will provide sufficient financial flexibility to meet seasonal
working capital requirements and to fund capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, cash dividends on common shares, share repurchases and additional
growth opportunities for the foreseeable future. Our investment grade credit
ratings have had a favorable impact on our cost of and access to capital, and
we believe that our improved financial performance should provide us with
access to additional financing, if necessary, to fund growth opportunities that
cannot be funded from existing sources.

Outlook

As
discussed in the Overview, we believe that the underlying fundamentals of the
diagnostic testing industry will continue to improve and that over the long
term the industry will continue to grow. As the leading provider of diagnostic
testing, information and services with the most extensive network of
laboratories and patient service centers throughout the United States, we
believe we are well positioned to benefit from the growth expected in our
industry.

We
believe our focus on Six Sigma quality and the investments we are continuing to
make in sales, service, science and information technology will further
differentiate us and strengthen our industry leadership position. In addition,
we plan to pursue selective acquisitions of regional and local laboratory
testing providers. We also expect to pursue opportunities to expand into other
areas of diagnostics and other markets outside the United States.

Our
strong cash generation, balance sheet and credit profile position us well to
take advantage of growth opportunities.

Inflation

We
believe that inflation generally does not have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial condition because the majority of our
contracts are short term.

Impact
of New Accounting Standards

In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, revised 2004, “Share-Based
Payment” and in May 2005, issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections”. The impact of these accounting standards is discussed in Note 2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

The
  management of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (the “Company”), including
  its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for
  establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
  as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act
  of 1934. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
  control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria for
  effective internal control over financial reporting described in

“Internal
  Control – Integrated Framework”

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
  Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included
  an evaluation of the design of the Company’s internal control over financial
  reporting and testing of the operating effectiveness of its internal control
  over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management has determined
  that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
  31, 2005 is effective.

The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures
that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on
the consolidated financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

Management
has excluded from the scope of its assessment the business of Lab

One

, Inc., which the Company acquired
during the fourth quarter of 2005. Lab

One

, Inc. is a
wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 3.3%
and 1.6%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their report appearing on pages F-1 and F-2, which expresses
unqualified opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005.


Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated

We
have completed integrated audits of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated’s 2005 and
2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 and an audit of its 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based
on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and
its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal
control over financial reporting

Also,
in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Report of
Management On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

F-1

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As
described in the Report of Management On Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, management has excluded Lab

One

,
Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business
combination during 2005. We have also excluded Lab

One

, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial
reporting. Lab

One

, Inc. is a
wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 3.3%
and 1.6%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005.

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Quest
Diagnostics Incorporated and its subsidiaries (“Quest Diagnostics” or the “Company”)
is the largest clinical laboratory testing business in the United States.  Prior to January 1, 1997, Quest Diagnostics
was a wholly owned subsidiary of Corning Incorporated (“Corning”).  On December 31, 1996, Corning distributed
all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company to the
stockholders of Corning as part of the “Spin-Off Distribution”.

As
the nation’s leading provider of diagnostic testing and services for the
healthcare industry, Quest Diagnostics offers a broad range of clinical
laboratory testing services to patients, physicians, hospitals, healthcare
insurers, employers, governmental institutions and other commercial clinical
laboratories.  Quest Diagnostics is the
leading provider of esoteric testing, including gene-based testing.  The Company is also the leading provider of
testing for drugs-of-abuse.  Through the
Company’s national network of laboratories and patient service centers, and its
esoteric testing laboratory and development facilities, Quest Diagnostics
offers comprehensive and innovative diagnostic testing, information and
services used by physicians and other healthcare professionals to make
decisions to improve health.  The
Company is also a leading provider of anatomic pathology services, testing to
support clinical trials of new pharmaceuticals worldwide, and risk assessment
services for the life insurance industry.

During
2005, Quest Diagnostics processed approximately 144 million requisitions
through its extensive network of laboratories and patient service centers in
virtually every major metropolitan area throughout the United States.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles
of Consolidation

The
  consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled
  by the Company through its direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting
  interest. While the Company does not have any relationships with variable interest
  entities, as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
  Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”,
  as revised (“FIN 46”), the existence of any such entity would require
  consolidation if the Company were subject to a majority of the risk of loss
  from the variable interest entity’s activities, or entitled to receive
  a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both. Investments in entities
  which the Company does not control, but in which it has a substantial ownership
  interest (generally between 20% and 49%) and can exercise significant influence,
  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As of December 31,
  2005 and 2004, the Company’s investments in affiliates accounted for under the equity method of accounting totaled $36.5 million and $35.8 million, respectively. The Company’s share of equity earnings from investments
  in affiliates, accounted for under the equity method, totaled $26.2 million,
  $21.0 million and $17.4 million, respectively, for 2005, 2004 and 2003. All
  significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company primarily recognizes revenue for services rendered upon completion of
the testing process.  Billings for
services reimbursed by third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid, are
recorded as revenues net of allowances for differences between amounts billed
and the estimated receipts from such payers.
Adjustments to the estimated receipts, based on final settlement with
the third-party payers, are recorded upon settlement.  In 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 18%, 17% and 17%,
respectively, of net revenues were generated by Medicare and Medicaid
programs.  Under capitated arrangements
with healthcare insurers, the Company recognizes revenue based

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

on a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each
member of an insurer’s health plan regardless of the number or cost of services
provided by the Company.

Taxes
on Income

The
Company uses the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases using tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are expected to reverse.  A
valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when
the change is enacted.

Earnings
Per Share

Basic
earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income,
adjusted for the after-tax impact of the interest expense associated with the
Company’s 1¾% contingent convertible debentures due 2021 (the “Debentures”), by
the weighted average common shares outstanding after giving effect to all
potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.  Potentially dilutive common shares include
the dilutive effect of the Debentures, and outstanding stock options and
restricted common shares granted under the Company’s Amended and Restated
Employee Long-Term Incentive Plan and Amended and Restated Director Long-Term
Incentive Plan.

On
June 20, 2005, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split through the
issuance of a stock dividend of one new share of common stock for each share of
common stock held by stockholders of record on June 6, 2005.  References to the number of common shares
and per common share amounts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
and consolidated statements of operations, including earnings per common share
calculations and related disclosures, have been restated to give retroactive
effect to the stock split for all periods presented.

In
September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a final
consensus on Issue 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on
Diluted Earnings per Share”, (“Issue 04-8”), effective December 31, 2004.  Pursuant to Issue 04-8, the Company included
the dilutive effect of its Debentures in its dilutive earnings per common share
calculations using the if-converted method, regardless of whether or not the
holders of these securities were permitted to exercise their conversion rights.
The Debentures were called for redemption by the Company in December 2004, and
redeemed as of January 18, 2005.  See
Note 10 for further discussion of the Debentures.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
 (“SFAS 123”), as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123” (“SFAS 148”) encourages, but does not require, companies to
record compensation cost for stock-based compensation plans at fair value.  In addition, SFAS 148 provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation, and amends the disclosure
requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and
interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.

The
Company has chosen to adopt the disclosure only provisions of SFAS 148 and
continue to account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”), and related interpretations.  Under this approach, the cost of restricted
stock awards is expensed over their vesting period, while the imputed cost of
stock option grants and discounts offered under the Company’s Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) is disclosed, based on the vesting provisions of the
individual grants, but not charged to expense.
Stock-based compensation expense recorded in accordance with APB 25,
relating to restricted stock awards, was $2.0 million, $1.4 million and $5.3
million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

The
Company has several stock ownership and compensation plans, which are described
more fully in Note 12. The following table presents net income and basic and
diluted earnings per common share, had the Company elected to recognize
compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant dates for stock option
awards and discounts granted for stock purchases under the Company’s ESPP,
consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148 (in
thousands, except per share data):

The
  fair value of each option granted prior to January 1, 2005 was estimated on
  the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value
  of each stock option award granted subsequent to January 1, 2005 was estimated
  on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model. Management
  believes a lattice-based option valuation model provides a more accurate measure
  of fair value. The expected volatility in connection with the Black-Scholes
  option-pricing model was based on the historical volatility of the Company’s
  stock, while the expected volatility under the lattice-based option valuation
  model was based on the current and the historical implied volatilities from
  traded options of the Company’s stock. The weighted average assumptions
  used in valuing options granted in the periods presented are:

The
majority of options granted in 2003 were issued prior to the declaration of the
Company’s initial quarterly cash dividend in the fourth quarter of 2003 and as
such carry a dividend yield of 0%, thereby reducing the weighted average
dividend yield for 2003 to 0.0%.

Foreign
Currency

Assets
and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at
year-end exchange rates.  Income and
expense items are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the
year.  The translation adjustments are
recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within
stockholders’ equity.  Gains and losses
from foreign currency transactions are included within “other operating expense
(income), net” in the consolidated statements of operations.  Transaction gains and losses have not been
material.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash
and cash equivalents include all highly-liquid investments with maturities, at
the time acquired by the Company, of three months or less.

F-10

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

Concentration
of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
accounts receivable.  The Company’s
policy is to place its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in
highly rated financial instruments and institutions. Concentration of credit
risk with respect to accounts receivable is mitigated by the diversity of the
Company’s clients and their dispersion across many different geographic
regions, and is limited to certain customers who are large buyers of the
Company’s services.  To reduce risk, the
Company routinely assesses the financial strength of these customers and,
consequently, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure, with
respect to these customers, is limited. While the Company has receivables due
from federal and state governmental agencies, the Company does not believe that
such receivables represent a credit risk since the related healthcare programs
are funded by federal and state governments, and payment is primarily dependent
on submitting appropriate documentation.

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts
receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful
accounts, which is estimated and recorded in the period of the related revenue.  The Company has implemented a standardized approach
to
estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on a number of
factors, including the period they have been outstanding.  Historical collection and payer reimbursement
experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for doubtful
accounts. In addition, the Company regularly assesses the state of its billing
operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectibility of
receivables or reserve estimates.
Revisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded
as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative
expenses.  Receivables deemed to
be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the
time such receivables are written-off.
Recoveries of receivables previously written-off are recorded as credits
to the allowance for doubtful accounts.

Inventories

Inventories,
which consist principally of supplies, are valued at the lower of cost (first
in, first out method) or market.

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property,
plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Major renewals and improvements are
capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Costs incurred for computer software
developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized for application
development activities and expensed as incurred for preliminary project
activities and post-implementation activities. Capitalized costs include external
direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining
internal-use software, payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are
directly associated with and who devote time to the internal-use software
project, and interest costs incurred, when material, while developing
internal-use software.  Capitalization
of such costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for
its intended purpose.  Certain costs,
such as maintenance and training, are expensed as incurred. The Company
capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction period of
major capital projects.  Capitalized
interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is amortized over
the useful lives of the assets.
Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method
over expected useful asset lives as follows: buildings and improvements,
ranging from ten to thirty years; laboratory equipment and furniture and
fixtures, ranging from three to seven years; leasehold improvements, the lesser
of the useful life of the improvement or the remaining life of the building or
lease, as applicable; and computer software developed or obtained for internal
use, ranging from three to five years.

Goodwill

Goodwill
represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of
assets acquired, including separately recognized intangible assets, less the
fair value of liabilities assumed in a business combination.  The Company uses a nonamortization approach
to account for purchased goodwill.
Under a nonamortization approach, goodwill is not amortized, but instead
is reviewed for impairment.

F-11

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

Intangible
Assets

Intangible
  assets are recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if the asset arises from
  contractual or other legal rights, or if it is separable. Intangible assets,
  principally representing the cost of customer relationships, customer lists
  and non-competition agreements acquired, are capitalized and amortized on the
  straight-line method over their expected useful life, which generally ranges
  from five to twenty years. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, consisting
  principally of acquired tradenames, are not amortized, but instead are reviewed
  for impairment.

Recoverability
and Impairment of Goodwill

Under
the nonamortization provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“SFAS 142”), goodwill and certain intangibles are not amortized into
results of operations, but instead are reviewed for impairment and an
impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying
value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its estimated fair
value.  The provisions of SFAS 142
require that a goodwill impairment test be performed annually or in the case of
other events that indicate a potential impairment. The annual impairment tests
of goodwill were performed at the end of each of the Company’s fiscal years on
December 31

st

and indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill
as of December 31, 2005 or 2004.

The
Company evaluates the recoverability and measures the potential impairment of
its goodwill under SFAS 142.  The annual
impairment test is a two-step process that begins with the estimation of the
fair value of the reporting unit. The first step screens for potential
impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment, if any.
Management’s estimate of fair value considers publicly available information
regarding the market capitalization of the Company as well as (i) publicly
available information regarding comparable publicly-traded companies in the
clinical laboratory testing industry, (ii) the financial projections and future
prospects of the Company’s business, including its growth opportunities and
likely operational improvements, and (iii) comparable sales prices, if
available. As part of the first step to assess potential impairment, management
compares the estimate of fair value for the reporting unit to the book value of
the reporting unit. If the book value is greater than the estimate of fair
value, the Company would then proceed to the second step to measure the
impairment, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill
with its carrying value.  The implied
fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to
all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had
been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting
unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit.  The excess of the fair value of the
reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the
implied fair value of goodwill.  If the
carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied
fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess.
Management believes its estimation methods are reasonable and reflective of
common valuation practices.

On
a quarterly basis, management performs a review of the Company’s business to
determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have
a material adverse effect on the fair value of the Company and its goodwill. If
such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred, the
Company would perform an impairment test of goodwill as of the end of the
quarter, consistent with the annual impairment test, and record any noted
impairment loss.

Recoverability
and Impairment of Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

The
Company evaluates the possible impairment of its long-lived assets, including
intangible assets which are amortized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS 142,
under SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”.  The Company reviews the recoverability of
its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that
indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.  Evaluation of possible impairment is based
on the Company’s ability to recover the asset from the expected future pretax
cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related
operations.  If the expected
undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset,
an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair
value and carrying amount of the asset.

Investments

The
Company accounts for investments in equity securities, which are included in “other
assets” in conformity with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”), which requires the use of fair value
accounting for trading or available-for-sale securities.  Both realized and unrealized gains and
losses for trading securities are recorded currently in earnings as a component
of non-operating expenses within “other, net” in the consolidated statements of
operations.  Unrealized gains and losses
for available-for-sale securities are recorded as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity.  Gains and losses on securities sold are
based on the average cost method.

Investments
at December 31, 2005 and 2004 consisted of the following:

Investments
in available-for-sale equity securities consist primarily of equity securities
in public corporations.  Investments in
trading equity securities represent participant directed investments of
deferred employee compensation and related Company matching contributions held
in a trust pursuant to the Company’s supplemental deferred compensation plan
(see Note 12).  Other investments do not
have readily determinable fair values and consist primarily of investments in
preferred and common shares of privately held companies.

As
of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had gross unrealized (losses) gains
from available-for-sale equity securities of ($11.1) million and $4.2 million,
respectively.  For the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, gains from trading equity securities totaled
$1.6 million, $1.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively, and are included in “other,
net” within the consolidated statements of operations.  In addition, for the year ended December 31,
2005, “other, net” includes a $7.1 million charge associated with the
write-down of an investment.

Financial
Instruments

The
Company’s policy for managing exposure to market risks may include the use of
financial instruments, including derivatives.
The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment
and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument
activities.  These policies prohibit
holding or issuing derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

SFAS
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS
133”), as amended, requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the
balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current
earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is
designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge
transaction.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts
payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short maturity
of these instruments. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair value of the
Company’s debt was estimated at $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively,
using quoted market prices and yields for the same or similar types of
borrowings, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt
instruments.  At December 31, 2005 and
2004, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the debt by $39
million and $84 million, respectively.

The
Company’s Debentures had a contingent interest component that would have
required the Company to pay contingent interest based on certain thresholds, as
outlined in the indenture governing such notes.  The contingent interest component, which is more fully described
in Note 10, was considered to be a derivative instrument subject to

F-13

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

SFAS 133, as amended.
The Debentures were called for redemption by the Company in December
2004, and redeemed as of January 18, 2005.
At December 31, 2004 the derivative was recorded at its fair value in
the consolidated balance sheet and was not material.

Comprehensive
(Loss) Income

Comprehensive
(loss) income encompasses all changes in stockholders’ equity (except those arising
from transactions with stockholders) and includes net income, net unrealized
capital gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, foreign currency
translation adjustments and deferred gains related to the settlement of certain
treasury lock agreements (see Note 10).

New
  Accounting Standards

In
  December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, revised 2004, “Share-Based
  Payment” (“SFAS 123R”). SFAS 123R requires that companies recognize
  compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions based on the
  fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS 123R is effective
  for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2006. The Company adopted SFAS
  123R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective approach. Under
  this approach, awards that are granted, modified or settled after January 1,
  2006 will be measured and accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123R. Unvested
  awards that were granted prior to January 1, 2006 will continue to be accounted
  for in accordance with SFAS 123 except that compensation costs will be recognized
  in the Company’s results of operations. The Company expects the estimated
  impact of SFAS 123R to (i) reduce diluted earnings per common share by approximately
  $0.20, (ii) reduce operating income as a percentage of revenues by approximately
  1%, and (iii) require the tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock
  options be included in cash flows from financing activities. In 2005, tax benefits
  from the exercise of stock options increased cash from operations by $33.8 million.

In
May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections” (“SFAS 154”), which replaces APB No. 20 “Accounting Changes”, and SFAS
No. 3 “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements”.  SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the
accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle, and applies
to all voluntary changes in accounting principles, as well as changes required
by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance it does not include
specific transition provisions.
Specifically, SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior
periods’ financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine the
period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change.  SFAS 154 is effective for the Company
beginning January 1, 2006.

3. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

Acquisition
of LabOne, Inc.

On
November 1, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of Lab

One

, Inc. (“LabOne”) in a transaction
valued at approximately $947 million, including approximately $138 million of
assumed debt of LabOne.  LabOne provides
health screening and risk assessment services to life insurance companies, as
well as clinical diagnostic testing services to healthcare providers and
drugs-of-abuse testing to employers.

Under
the terms of the merger agreement, the Company paid $43.90 per common share in
cash or $768 million in total to acquire all of the outstanding common shares
of LabOne.  In addition, the Company
paid $33 million in cash for outstanding stock options of LabOne.  Pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, upon the

F-14

QUEST
DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

change in
control of LabOne, LabOne’s outstanding stock options
became fully vested and
exercisable and were cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive an amount,
for each share subject to the stock option, equal to the excess
of $43.90 per
share over the exercise price per share of such option.  The
aggregate purchase price of $809 million
includes transaction costs of approximately $8 million.

In
conjunction with the acquisition of LabOne, the Company repaid
approximately
$127 million of debt, representing substantially all of
LabOne’s existing
outstanding debt as of November 1, 2005.

The
Company financed the all cash purchase price and related
transaction costs
associated with the LabOne acquisition, and the repayment of
substantially all
of LabOne’s outstanding debt with the net proceeds from a
$900 million private
placement of senior notes (see Note 10) and cash
on-hand.

Through
the acquisition of LabOne, the Company acquired all of
LabOne’s operations,
including its health screening and risk assessment services for
life
insurance companies, its clinical diagnostic testing services,
and its
drugs-of-abuse testing for employers.
LabOne has 3,100 employees and principal laboratories in Lenexa,
Kansas,
as well as in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The
acquisition of LabOne was accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting.  As such, the cost to acquire LabOne was
allocated to the
respective assets and liabilities acquired based on their
estimated fair values
as of the closing date.  A preliminary
allocation of the costs to acquire LabOne has been made to
certain assets and
liabilities of LabOne based on preliminary estimates.  The
Company is continuing to assess the estimated fair values of
the assets and liabilities acquired and the portion of goodwill allocable to its clinical laboratory testing business and its risk assessment business.  The consolidated financial
statements include the
results of operations of LabOne subsequent to the closing of the
acquisition.

The
preliminary allocation of the cost to acquire LabOne is as
follows:

Of
the $139 million of acquired intangible assets, $130 million was
assigned to
customer relationships that are being amortized over 20 years
and $9 million
was assigned to trade names that are not subject to
amortization.  Of the $680 million allocated to goodwill,
approximately $47 million is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes.

Acquisition
of Unilab Corporation

On February
  28, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of Unilab Corporation (“Unilab”),
  the leading commercial clinical laboratory in California. In connection with
  the acquisition, the Company paid $297 million in cash and issued 14.1 million
  shares of Quest Diagnostics common stock to acquire all of the outstanding capital
  stock of Unilab. In addition, the Company reserved approximately 0.6 million
  shares of Quest Diagnostics

F-15

QUEST
DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

common stock for outstanding stock options of
Unilab
which were converted upon the completion of the acquisition into
options to
acquire shares of Quest Diagnostics common stock (the
“converted options”).

The aggregate
  purchase price of $698 million included the cash portion of the purchase price
  of $297 million and transaction costs of approximately $20 million, with the
  remaining portion of the purchase price paid through the issuance of 14.1 million
  shares of Quest Diagnostics common stock (valued at $372 million or $26.40 per
  share, based on the average closing stock price of Quest Diagnostics common
  stock for the five trading days ended March 4, 2003) and the issuance of approximately
  0.6 million converted options (valued at approximately $9 million, based on
  the Black Scholes option-pricing model).

In
conjunction with the acquisition of Unilab, the Company repaid
$220 million of
debt, representing substantially all of Unilab’s then
existing outstanding
debt, and related accrued interest.  Of
the $220 million, $124 million represents payments related to
the Company’s
cash tender offer, which was completed on March 7, 2003, for all
of the
outstanding $101 million principal amount and related accrued
interest of
Unilab’s 12¾% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 and
$23 million of related
tender premium and associated tender offer costs.

The
Company financed the cash portion of the purchase price and
related transaction
costs, and the repayment of substantially all of Unilab’s
outstanding debt and
related accrued interest, with the proceeds from a new $450
million amortizing
term loan due June 2007 and cash on-hand.
During 2003, the Company repaid $145 million of principal
outstanding
under the term loan due June 2007.
During 2004, the Company refinanced the remaining $305 million of
principal outstanding under the term loan due June 2007 with
$100 million of
borrowings under the Company’s senior unsecured revolving
credit facility, $130
million of borrowings under the Company’s secured
receivables credit facility
and $75 million of borrowings under the Company’s term loan
due December 2008.

As
part of the Unilab acquisition, Quest Diagnostics acquired all
of Unilab’s
operations, including its primary testing facilities in Los
Angeles, San Jose
and Sacramento, California, and approximately 365 patient
service centers and
35 rapid response laboratories and approximately 4,100
employees.  As the leading commercial clinical
laboratory in California, the acquisition of Unilab further
solidified the
Company’s leading position within the clinical laboratory
testing industry, and
further enhanced its national network and access to its
comprehensive range of
services for physicians, hospitals, patients and healthcare
insurers.

In
connection with the acquisition of Unilab, as part of a
settlement agreement
with the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Company
entered into an
agreement to sell to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings,
Inc., (“LabCorp”),
certain assets in northern California for $4.5 million,
including the
assignment of agreements with four independent physician
associations (“IPA”)
and leases for 46 patient service centers (five of which also
serve as rapid
response laboratories) (the “Divestiture”).
Approximately $27 million in annual net revenues were generated
by
capitated fees under the IPA agreements and associated
fee-for-service testing
for physicians whose patients use these patient service centers,
as well as
from specimens received directly from the IPA physicians.  The
Company completed the transfer of assets
and assignment of the IPA agreements to LabCorp and recorded a
$1.5 million
gain in the third quarter of 2003 in connection with the
Divestiture, which is
included in “other operating expense (income), net”
within the consolidated
statements of operations.

Pro
Forma Combined Financial Information

The
following unaudited pro forma combined financial information for
the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 assumes that the LabOne
acquisition was
completed on January 1, 2004. The unaudited pro forma combined
financial
information for the year ended December 31, 2003 assumes that
the Unilab
acquisition and the Divestiture were completed on January 1,
2003 (in thousands,
except per share data):

The
unaudited pro forma combined financial information presented
above reflects
certain reclassifications to the historical financial statements
of LabOne and
Unilab to conform the acquired companies’ accounting
policies and classification
of certain costs and expenses to that of Quest Diagnostics.
These adjustments had no impact on pro forma
net income.  Pro forma results for the
year ended December 31, 2005 exclude $14.3 million of
transaction related
costs, which were incurred and expensed by LabOne in conjunction
with its
acquisition by Quest Diagnostics. Pro forma results for the year
ended December
31, 2003 exclude $14.5 million of transaction related costs,
which were
incurred and expensed by Unilab in conjunction with its
acquisition by Quest
Diagnostics.

4. INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED
BUSINESSES

In
July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” (“SFAS 146”). SFAS 146, which the Company adopted effective January 1, 2003,
requires
that a liability for a cost associated with an exit activity,
including those
related to employee termination benefits and contractual
obligations, be
recognized when the liability is incurred, and not necessarily
the date of an
entity’s commitment to an exit plan, as under previous
accounting
guidance.  The provisions of SFAS 146
apply to integration costs associated with actions that impact
the employees
and operations of Quest Diagnostics.
Costs associated with actions that impact the employees and
operations
of an acquired company, such as LabOne or Unilab, are accounted
for as a cost
of the acquisition and included in goodwill in accordance with
EITF No. 95-3, “Recognition
of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business
Combination”.

Integration
of LabOne, Inc.

The
plan and related costs associated with the integration of
LabOne’s operations
into the Company’s laboratory network have not been
finalized, as such,
management has not yet finalized its estimate of integration
costs.  Mangement expects a significant portion of
these costs will require cash outlays and will primarily relate
to severance
and other integration-related costs, including the elimination
of excess
capacity and workforce reductions.

Integration
of Unilab Corporation

During
the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company finalized its plan
related to the
integration of Unilab into Quest Diagnostics’ laboratory
network.  As part of the plan, following the sale of
certain assets to LabCorp as part of the Divestiture, the
Company closed its
previously owned clinical laboratory in the San Francisco Bay
area and
completed the integration of remaining customers in the northern
California
area into its laboratories in San Jose and Sacramento.  As of
December 31, 2005, the Company
operated two laboratories in the Los Angeles metropolitan

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

area.  As part
of the integration plan, the Company plans to open a new
regional laboratory in
the Los Angeles metropolitan area into which it will integrate
all of its
business in the area.  The Company
expects to integrate its business into this new facility during
the first
quarter of 2006.

During
2003, the Company recorded $9 million of costs associated with
executing the
Unilab integration plan.  The majority
of these integration costs related to employee severance and
contractual
obligations associated with leased facilities and equipment.
Employee groups affected as a result of this
plan include those involved in the collection and testing of
specimens, as well
as administrative and other support functions.
Of the $9 million in costs, $7.9 million was recorded in the
fourth
quarter of 2003 and related to actions that impact the employees
and operations
of Unilab, was accounted for as a cost of the Unilab acquisition
and included
in goodwill.  Of the $7.9 million, $6.8
million related to employee severance benefits for approximately
150 employees,
with the remainder primarily related to contractual
obligations.  In addition, $1.1 million of integration
costs, related to actions that impact Quest Diagnostics’
employees and
operations and comprised principally of employee severance
benefits for
approximately 30 employees, were accounted for as a charge to
earnings in the
third quarter of 2003 and included in “other operating
expense (income), net”
within the consolidated statements of operations. As of December
31, 2004,  accruals related to the Unilab integration
plan totaled $3.0 million.  The actions
associated with the Unilab integration plan, including those
related to severed
employees, were completed in 2005.  The
remaining accruals associated with the Unilab integration were
not material at
December 31, 2005.

5. TAXES ON INCOME

The
Company’s pretax income consisted of $904 million, $826
million and $736
million from U.S. operations and approximately $6.0 million,
$9.1 million and
$1.4 million from foreign operations for the years ended
December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
components of income tax expense (benefit) for 2005, 2004 and
2003 were as
follows:

A
reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the
Company’s effective tax
rate for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was as follows:

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to
significant portions of
the deferred taxes at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were as
follows:

The
non-current deferred tax liability of $22 million at December
31, 2005 is
included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance
sheet.

As
of December 31, 2005, the Company had estimated net operating
loss carryforwards
for federal and state income tax purposes of $24 million and
$311 million,
respectively, which expire at various dates through 2025.  As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, deferred
tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards for
federal and
state income tax purposes of $22 million and $30 million,
respectively, have
each been reduced by a valuation allowance of $14 million and
$16 million,
respectively.

Income
taxes payable at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $29 million and
$28 million,
respectively, and consisted primarily of federal income taxes
payable of $19
million and $25 million, respectively.

The Company
  provides reserves for potential tax exposures that may arise from examinations
  by federal or state tax authorities. Management believes that while the ultimate
  resolution of these matters will not be material to the Company’s financial
  position, resolution of these matters could be material to the Company’s
  results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the resolution of
  such matters is determined.

In
conjunction with the Spin-Off Distribution, the Company entered
into a tax
sharing agreement with its former parent and a former
subsidiary, that provide
the parties with certain rights of indemnification against each
other.  In conjunction with its acquisition of
SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories, Inc.
(“SBCL”), which operated the
clinical laboratory testing business of SmithKline Beecham plc
(“SmithKline Beecham”),
the Company entered into a tax indemnification arrangement with
SmithKline
Beecham that provides the parties with certain rights of
indemnification
against each other.

The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) was
signed into law on October
22, 2004.  The provisions of the Act did
not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
results of operations
or financial condition.

  included in other operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statement
  of operations, to write-off all of the goodwill associated with its test kit
  manufacturing subsidiary, NID. See Note 15 for further details. For the year
  ended December 31, 2004, the reduction in goodwill was primarily related to
  an increase in pre-acquisition tax net operating losses and credit carryforwards
  associated with businesses acquired.

Amortizing
intangible assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004 consisted of the

Debt Refinancings

On
April
20, 2004, the Company entered into a new $500 million senior
unsecured
revolving credit facility which replaced a $325 million
unsecured revolving
credit facility.  Under the new $500
million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the
“Credit Facility”),
which matures in April 2009, interest is based on certain
published rates plus
an applicable margin that will vary over an approximate range of
90 basis
points based on changes in the Company’s public debt
rating.  At the option of the Company, it may elect
to enter into LIBOR-based interest rate contracts for periods up
to 180
days.  Interest on any outstanding
amounts not covered under the LIBOR-based interest rate
contracts is based on
an alternate base rate, which is calculated by reference to the
prime rate or
federal funds rate.  As of December 31,
2005 and 2004, the Company’s borrowing rate for LIBOR-based
loans was LIBOR
plus 0.50% and 0.625%, respectively.
The Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Company’s wholly
owned
subsidiaries that operate clinical laboratories in the United
States (the “Subsidiary
Guarantors”). The Credit Facility contains various
covenants, including the
maintenance of certain financial ratios, which could impact the
Company’s
ability to, among other things, incur additional
indebtedness.

F-22

QUEST
DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

In
addition, on April 20, 2004, the Company entered into a new $300 million
receivables securitization facility which replaced a $250 million receivables
securitization facility that matured in April 2004.  The new $300 million receivables securitization facility  (the “Secured
Receivables Credit Facility”)
matures in April 2007.  Interest on the
Secured Receivables Credit Facility is based on rates that are intended to
approximate commercial paper rates for highly rated issuers.  At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company’s
borrowing rate under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility was 4.7% and 2.7%,
respectively.  The Secured Receivables
Credit Facility is supported by one-year back-up facilities provided by two
banks on a committed basis. Borrowings outstanding under the Secured
Receivables Credit Facility, if any, are classified as a current liability on
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet since the lenders fund the borrowings
through the issuance of commercial paper which matures at various dates within
one year from the date of issuance and the term of the one-year back-up
facilities described above.

In
conjunction with the debt refinancings, the Company recorded a $2.9 million
charge to earnings in the second quarter of 2004 representing the write-off of
deferred financing costs associated with the debt that was refinanced.  The $2.9 million charge was included in
interest expense, net within the consolidated statements of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2004.

Industrial Revenue Bonds

In
connection with the acquisition of LabOne, the Company assumed $7.2 million of
Industrial Revenue Bonds.  Principal is
payable annually in equal installments through September 1, 2009.  Interest is payable monthly at a rate adjusted
weekly based on LIBOR plus approximately 0.08% or 4.5% as of December 31,
2005.  The bonds are secured by the
Lenexa, Kansas laboratory facility and an irrevocable bank letter of credit.

Senior
Notes

In
conjunction with its 2001 debt refinancing, the Company completed a $550
million senior notes offering in June 2001 (the “2001 Senior Notes”).  The 2001 Senior Notes were issued in two
tranches: (a) $275 million aggregate principal amount of 6¾% senior notes due
2006 (“Senior Notes due 2006”), issued at a discount of approximately $1.6
million and (b) $275 million aggregate principal amount of 7½% senior notes due
2011 (“Senior Notes due 2011”), issued at a discount of approximately $1.1
million.  After considering the
discounts, the effective interest rates on the Senior Notes due 2006 and the
Senior Notes due 2011 are 6.9% and 7.6%, respectively. The 2001  Senior Notes require semiannual interest
payments which commenced January 12, 2002.
The 2001 Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank
equally with the Company’s other unsecured senior obligations.  The 2001 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the
Subsidiary Guarantors and do not have a sinking fund requirement.

On
October 31, 2005, the Company completed its $900 million private placement of
senior notes (the “2005 Senior Notes”).
The 2005 Senior Notes were priced in two tranches: (a) $400 million
aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due November 1, 2010 (“Senior
Notes due 2010”); and (b) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.45%
senior notes due November 1, 2015 (“Senior Notes due 2015”).   The Company used the net proceeds from the
2005 Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, to pay the cash purchase price
and transaction costs of the LabOne acquisition and to repay $127 million of
LabOne’s debt. The Senior Notes due 2010 were issued at a discount of  $0.8 million, and the Senior Notes due 2015
were issued at a discount of  $1.6
million.  After considering the
discounts, the effective interest rates on the Senior Notes due 2010 and 2015
are approximately 5.3% and 5.6%, respectively.
The 2005 Senior Notes require semiannual interest payments, which will
commence on May 1, 2006.  The 2005
Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with the
Company’s other unsecured senior obligations. The 2005 Senior Notes are
guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors.
Under a registration rights agreement executed in connection with the
offering and sale of the 2005 Senior Notes and related guarantees, the
Company filed a registration statement which was declared effective on February
16, 2006, to enable the holders of the 2005 Senior Notes to exchange the notes
and guarantees for publicly registered notes and guarantees.

Treasury Lock Agreements

In October
2005, the Company entered into interest rate lock agreements with two financial
institutions for a total notional amount of $300 million to lock the U.S.
treasury rate component of a portion of the Company’s offering of its debt
securities in the fourth quarter of 2005 (the “Treasury Lock Agreements”). The
Treasury Lock Agreements,

F-23

QUEST
DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

which had
an original maturity date of November 9, 2005, were entered into to hedge part
of the Company’s interest rate exposure associated with the minimum amount of
debt securities that were issued in the fourth quarter of 2005. In connection
with the Company’s private placement of its Senior Notes due 2015 on October
25, 2005, the Treasury Lock Agreements were settled and the Company received
$2.5 million, representing the gain on the settlement of the Treasury Lock
Agreements. These gains are deferred in stockholders’ equity (as a component of
comprehensive income) and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over
the term of the Senior Notes due 2015.

Term
Loan due December 2008

On
December 19, 2003, the Company entered into a $75 million amortizing term loan
facility (the “term loan due December 2008”), which was funded on January 12,
2004. Interest under the term loan due December 2008 is based on LIBOR plus an
applicable margin that can fluctuate over a range of up to 119 basis points,
based on changes in the Company’s public debt rating.  At the option of the Company, it may elect to enter into
LIBOR-based interest rate contracts for periods up to 180 days.  Interest on any outstanding amounts not
covered under the LIBOR-based interest rate contracts is based on an alternate
base rate, which is calculated by reference to the prime rate or federal funds
rate.  As of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
the Company’s borrowing rate for LIBOR-based loans was LIBOR plus 0.50% and
0.55%, respectively.  The term loan due
December 2008 requires principal repayments of the initial amount borrowed
equal to 20% on each of the third and fourth anniversary dates of the funding
and the remainder of the outstanding balance on December 31, 2008. The term
loan due December 2008 is guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors and contains
various covenants similar to those under the Credit Facility.

Debentures due June 2034

In
connection with the acquisition of LabOne, the Company assumed  $103.5 million of 3.50% convertible senior
debentures of LabOne due June 15, 2034 (the “Debentures due June 2034”).  As a result of the change in control of
LabOne, the holders of the debentures had the right from November 1, 2005 to
December 1, 2005 to: (i) have their debentures repurchased by LabOne for 100%
of the principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon through November 30, 2005; or (ii) have their debentures converted into
the amount the respective holder would have received if the holder had
converted the debentures prior to November 1, 2005, plus an additional premium.
As a result of the change in control of LabOne, and as provided in the
indenture to the debentures, the conversion rate increased so that each $1,000
principal amount of the debentures was convertible into cash in the amount of
$1,280.88 if converted by December 1, 2005. As a result of the change in
control of LabOne, of the total outstanding principal balance of the Debentures
due June 2034 of $103.5 million, $99 million of principal was converted for
$126.8 million in cash, reflecting a premium of $27.8 million. The remaining
outstanding principal of the Debentures due June 2034 totaling $4.5 million was
adjusted to its estimated fair value of $2.9 million, reflecting a discount of
$1.6 million based on the net present value of the estimated remaining
obligations, at current interest rates.
The Debentures due June 2034 are no longer convertible into shares of
common stock of LabOne or the Company.
The Debentures due June 2034 require semi-annual interest payments in
June and December.

Contingent
Convertible Debentures

On
  November 26, 2001, the Company completed its $250 million offering of its Debentures.
  The net proceeds of the offering, together with cash on hand, were used to repay
  all of the $256 million principal that was then outstanding under the Company’s
  secured receivables credit facility. The Debentures, which paid a fixed rate
  of interest semi-annually commencing on May 31, 2002, had a contingent interest
  component, which was considered to be a derivative instrument subject to SFAS
  133, as amended, that would have required the Company to pay contingent interest
  based on certain thresholds, as outlined in the indenture governing the Debentures.
  For income tax purposes, the Debentures were considered to be a contingent payment
  security. As such, interest expense for tax purposes was based on an assumed
  interest rate related to a comparable fixed interest rate debt security issued
  by the Company without a conversion feature. The assumed interest rate for tax
  purposes was 7% for 2004.

The
Debentures were guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors and did not have a
sinking fund requirement.

Each
one thousand dollar principal amount of Debentures was convertible initially
into 22.858 shares of the Company’s common stock, which represented an initial
conversion price of $43.75 per share.
Holders were able to surrender the Debentures for conversion into shares
of the Company’s common stock under any of the following

F-24

QUEST
DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

circumstances:
(1) if the sales price of the Company’s common stock was above 120% of
the conversion price (or $52.50 per share) for specified periods; (2) if the
Company called the Debentures; or (3) if specified corporate transactions
occurred.

In
December 2004, the Company called for redemption all of its outstanding
Debentures.  Under the terms of the
Debentures, the holders of the Debentures had an option to submit their
Debentures for redemption at par plus accrued and unpaid interest or convert
their Debentures into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion
price of $43.75 per share.  Through
December 31, 2004, $3.2 million of principal of the Debentures were converted
into less than 0.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock.  The outstanding principal of the Debentures
at December 31, 2004 was classified as a current liability within short-term
borrowings and current portion of long-term debt on the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet.  As of January 18, 2005,
the redemption was completed and $0.4 million of principal was redeemed for
cash and $249.6 million of principal was converted into approximately 5.7
million shares of the Company’s common stock.

Letter
of Credit Lines

The
Company has two lines of credit with two financial institutions totaling $85
million for the issuance of letters of credit (the “letter of credit lines”).   The letter of credit lines mature in
December 2006 and are guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors.  As of December 31, 2005, there are $69
million of outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit lines.

As
of December 31, 2005 long-term debt, including capital leases, maturing in each
of the years subsequent to December 31, 2006, is as follows:

11. PREFERRED
STOCK AND COMMON STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Series
Preferred Stock

Quest
Diagnostics is authorized to issue up to 10 million shares of Series Preferred
Stock, par value $1.00 per share.  The
Company’s Board of Directors has the authority to issue such shares without
stockholder approval and to determine the designations, preferences, rights and
restrictions of such shares.  Of the
authorized shares, 1,300,000 shares have been designated Series A Preferred
Stock and 1,000 shares have been designated Voting Cumulative Preferred Stock.
No shares are currently outstanding.

Preferred
Share Purchase Rights

Each
share of Quest Diagnostics common stock trades with a preferred share purchase
right, which entitles stockholders to purchase one-hundredth of a share of
Series A Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain events.  In conjunction with the SBCL acquisition,
the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the preferred
share purchase rights.  The amended
rights entitle stockholders to purchase shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a
predefined price in the event a person or group (other than SmithKline Beecham)
acquires 20% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock.  The preferred share purchase rights expire
December 31, 2006.

Accumulated
Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income

The
components of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for 2005, 2004 and
2003 were as follows:

The
market value adjustments for 2005, 2004 and 2003 represented unrealized holding
gains (losses), net of taxes.  The
deferred gain for 2005 represented the $2.5 million the Company received upon the settlement of
its Treasury Lock Agreements, net of amounts reclassified as a reduction to
interest expense (see Note 10).

Dividend
Policy

On
October 21, 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors declared its first payment
of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.075 per common share.  During each of the quarters of 2005 and
2004, the Company’s Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend
of $0.09 and $0.075 per common share, respectively.  On January 26, 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors increased
the quarterly cash dividend per common share to $0.10.

Share
Repurchase Plan

In
2003, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program,
which permitted the Company to purchase up to $600 million of its common
stock.  In July 2004 and January 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to
purchase up to an additional $300 million and $350 million,
respectively, of its common stock. Under a separate authorization from the Board of Directors, in December
2004 the Company repurchased 5.4 million shares of its common stock for
approximately $254 million from GlaxoSmithKline plc.  For the year ended
December 31, 2005, the Company
repurchased approximately 7.8 million shares of its common stock at an average
price of $49.98 per share for $390 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company reissued approximately 5.6 million shares and 4.3
million shares, respectively, in connection with the conversion of it’s Debentures and for
employee benefit plans.  At December
31, 2005, $122 million of the share
repurchase authorization remained available.
In January 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors expanded the
share repurchase authorization by an additional $600 million, bringing the
total amount authorized and available for repurchases to $722 million.

12. STOCK
OWNERSHIP AND COMPENSATION PLANS

Employee
and Non-employee Directors Stock Ownership Programs

In
2005, the Company established the Amended and Restated Employee Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the “ELTIP”) to replace the Company’s prior Employee Equity
Participation Programs established in 1999 (the “1999 EEPP”) and 1996 (the “1996
EEPP”).  The ELTIP provides for three
types of awards: (a) stock options, (b) stock appreciation rights and (c)
incentive stock awards.  The ELTIP provides
for the grant to eligible employees of either non-qualified or incentive stock
options, or both, to purchase shares of Quest Diagnostics common stock at no
less than the fair market value on the date of grant.  The stock options are subject to forfeiture if employment
terminates prior to the end of the prescribed vesting period, as determined by
the Board of Directors. The stock options expire on the date designated by the
Board of Directors but in no event more than seven years from date of grant.  Grants of stock appreciation rights allow
eligible employees to receive a payment based on the appreciation of Quest
Diagnostics common stock in cash, shares of Quest Diagnostics common stock or a
combination thereof.  The stock
appreciation rights are granted at an exercise price at no less than the fair
market value of Quest Diagnostics common stock on the date of grant. Stock
appreciation rights expire on the date designated by the Board of Directors but
in no event more than seven years from date of grant.  No stock appreciation rights have been granted under the ELTIP or
the 1999 EEPP.  Under the incentive
stock provisions of the plan, the ELTIP allows eligible employees to receive
awards of shares, or the right to receive shares, of Quest Diagnostics common
stock, the equivalent value in cash or a combination thereof.  These shares are generally earned on
achievement of financial performance goals and are subject to forfeiture if
employment terminates prior to the end of the prescribed vesting period, which
ranges primarily from three to four years.
The fair market value of the shares awarded is recorded as unearned
compensation.  The amount of unearned
compensation is subject to adjustment based upon changes in earnings estimates,
if any, during the initial year of grant and is amortized to compensation
expense over the prescribed vesting period.
Key executive, managerial and technical employees are eligible to
participate in the ELTIP.  The
provisions of the 1999 EEPP and the 1996 EEPP were similar to those outlined
above for the ELTIP.  Certain options
granted under the 1999 EEPP and the 1996 EEPP remain outstanding.

The
ELTIP increased the maximum number of shares of Quest Diagnostics common stock
that may be optioned or granted to 48 million shares, after giving effect for
the Company’s two-for-one stock split effected on June 20, 2005 (see Note
2).  In addition, any remaining shares
under the 1996 EEPP are available for issuance under the ELTIP.

In
2005, the Company established the Amended and Restated Director Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the “DLTIP”), to replace the Company’s prior plan established
in 1998.  The DLTIP provides for the
grant to non-employee directors of non-qualified stock options to purchase
shares of Quest Diagnostics common stock at no less than the fair market value
on the date of grant and incentive stock awards.  The incentive stock awards are generally earned on achievement of
certain performance goals.  The maximum
number of shares that may be issued under the DLTIP is 2 million shares, after
giving effect for the Company’s two-for-one stock split effected on June 20,
2005 (see Note 2). The stock options expire seven years from date of grant and
generally vest over three years. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, grants under the
DLTIP totaled 110, 180 and 188 thousand shares, respectively.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

Under
the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), substantially all
employees can elect to have up to 10% of their annual wages withheld to
purchase Quest Diagnostics common stock.
The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of its
beginning-of-quarter or end-of-quarter market price.  In 2005, the Company’s ESPP was amended such that
effective July
1, 2005, the purchase price of the stock will be 85% of the market price of the
Company’s common stock on the last business day of each calendar month.  Under the ESPP, the maximum number
of shares
of Quest Diagnostics common stock which may be purchased by eligible employees
is 8 million.  The ESPP will terminate
effective December 31, 2006.  The
Company plans to submit for approval by the shareholders at its 2006 Annual
Meeting of Shareholders an extension of the plan.  Approximately 409, 460 and 544 thousand shares of common stock
were purchased by eligible employees in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Defined
Contribution Plan

The
Company maintains a qualified defined contribution plan covering substantially
all of its employees, and matches employee contributions up to a maximum of 6%.  The Company’s expense for
contributions to
its defined contribution plan aggregated $64 million, $62 million and $54
million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Supplemental
Deferred Compensation Plan

The
Company’s supplemental deferred compensation plan is an unfunded, non-qualified
plan that provides for certain management and highly compensated employees to
defer up to 50% of their eligible compensation in excess of their defined
contribution plan limits.  In addition,
certain members of senior management have an additional opportunity to defer up
to 95% of their variable incentive compensation.  The compensation deferred under this plan, together with Company
matching amounts, are credited with earnings or losses measured by the mirrored
rate of return on investments elected by plan participants.  Each plan participant is fully vested in all
deferred compensation, Company match and earnings credited to their
account.  Although the Company is
currently contributing all participant deferrals and matching amounts to a
trust, the funds in the trust, totaling $25.7 million and $20.9 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are general assets of the Company and
are subject to any claims of the Company’s creditors. The Company’s expense for
matching contributions to this plan were $0.8 million, $0.7 million and $0.4
million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

13.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

At
December 31, 2005, GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”), the result of the merger of
Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham in December 2000, beneficially owned
approximately 18% of the outstanding shares of Quest Diagnostics common
stock.  During 2004, the Company
repurchased approximately 7.8 million shares of its common stock for
approximately $355 million from GSK.

GSK
has a long-term contractual relationship with Quest Diagnostics under which
Quest Diagnostics is the primary provider of testing to support GSK’s clinical
trials testing requirements worldwide (the “Clinical Trials Agreements”).  Net
revenues, primarily derived under the Clinical Trials Agreements were $68,806,
$73,894 and $50,060 for 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively.

In
addition, under the SBCL acquisition agreements, SmithKline Beecham has agreed
to indemnify Quest Diagnostics, on an after tax basis, against certain matters
primarily related to taxes and billing and professional liability claims.

At
both December 31, 2005 and 2004, accounts payable and accrued expenses included
$28 million due to SmithKline Beecham, primarily related to tax benefits associated
with indemnifiable matters.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Minimum
rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases, primarily real estate,
in effect at December 31, 2005 are as follows:

Operating
lease rental expense for 2005, 2004 and 2003 aggregated $140 million, $133
million and $121 million, respectively.
Rent expense associated with operating leases that include scheduled
rent increases and tenant incentives, such as rent holidays, is recorded on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

The
  Company is subject to contingent obligations under certain leases and other
  instruments incurred in connection with real estate activities and other operations
  associated with LabOne and certain of its predecessor companies. The contingent
  obligations arise out of certain land leases with two Hawaiian trusts relating
  to land in Waikiki upon which a hotel is built and a land lease for a parking
  garage in Reno, Nevada. While its title and interest to the subject leases have
  been transferred to third parties, the land owners have not released the original
  obligors, including predecessors of LabOne, from their obligations under the
  leases. In early February 2006, the subtenant of the hotel in Waikiki filed
  for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Honolulu. The subtenant has publicly
  indicated that the filing will have no impact on the operations of the hotel
  and therefore, the Company believes the subtenant will continue to pay the rent
  and real estate taxes on the subject leased property. Should the current subtenants
  of the leased properties fail to pay their rent and real estate taxes for the
  subject leased property, the default could trigger liability for LabOne as well
  as other sublessors. The rent payments under the Hawaiian land leases are subject
  to market value adjustments every ten years beginning in 2007. Given that the
  Hawaiian land leases are subject to market value adjustments, the total contingent
  obligations under such leases cannot be precisely estimated, but are likely
  to total several hundred million dollars. The contingent obligation of the Nevada
  lease is estimated to be approximately $6 million. The Company believes that
  the leasehold improvements on the leased properties are significantly more valuable
  than the related lease obligations. Based on the circumstances above, no liability
  has been recorded for any potential contingent obligations related to the land
  leases. The Company has certain noncancelable commitments to purchase products
  or services from various suppliers, mainly for telecommunications and standing
  orders to purchase reagents and other laboratory supplies. At December 31, 2005,
  the approximate total future purchase commitments are $55 million, of which
  $28 million are expected to be incurred in 2006.

In
support of its risk management program, the Company has standby letters of
credit issued under its letter of credit lines to ensure its performance or
payment to third parties, which amounted to $69 million at December 31,
2005.  The letters of credit, which are
renewed annually, primarily represent collateral for current and future
automobile liability and workers’ compensation loss payments.

The
Company has entered into several settlement agreements with various government
and private payers during recent years relating to industry-wide billing and
marketing practices that had been substantially discontinued by the
mid-1990s.  The federal or state
governments may bring additional claims based on new theories as to the Company’s
practices which management believes to be in compliance with law.  In addition, certain federal and state
statues, including the qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act,
allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on
behalf of government or private payers alleging inappropriate billing
practices.  The Company is aware of
certain pending lawsuits related to billing practices filed under the qui tam
provisions of the False Claims Act and other federal and state statutes. These
lawsuits include class action and individual claims by patients arising out of
the Company’s billing practices.  In
addition, the Company is involved in various legal

F-30

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND
SUBSIDIARIES

(dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)

proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business.  Some of the proceedings
against the Company involve claims that are substantial in amount.

During
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company and its test kit manufacturing
subsidiary, NID, each received a subpoena from the United States Attorney’s
Office for the Eastern District of New York.
The Company and NID have been cooperating with the United States
Attorney’s Office.  In connection with
such cooperation, the Company has been providing information and producing
various business records of NID and the Company, including documents related to
testing and test kits manufactured by NID.
This investigation by the United States Attorney’s Office could lead to
civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties and additional liabilities from
third party claims.  In the second and
third quarters of 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) conducted
an inspection of NID and issued a Form 483 listing the observations made by the
FDA during the course of the inspection.
NID is cooperating with the FDA and has filed its responses to the Form
483.  Noncompliance with the FDA
regulatory requirements or failure to take adequate and timely corrective action
could lead to regulatory or enforcement action against NID and/or the Company,
including, but not limited to, a warning letter, injunction, suspension of
production and/or distribution, seizure or recall of products, fines or
penalties, denial of pre-market clearance for new or changed products,
recommendation against award of government contracts and criminal
prosecution.

During
the second quarter of 2005, the Company received a subpoena from the United
States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey.  The subpoena seeks the production of
business and financial records regarding capitation and risk sharing
arrangements with government and private payers for the years 1993 through
1999.  Also, during the third quarter of
2005, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the
Inspector
General.  The subpoena seeks the
production of various business records including records regarding our
relationship with health maintenance organizations, independent physician
associations, group purchasing organizations, and preferred provider
organizations from 1995 to the present.
The Company is cooperating with the United States Attorney’s Office and
the Office of the Inspector General.

Management
has established reserves in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles for the matters discussed above.
Although management cannot predict the outcome of such matters, management
does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition but may be
material to the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in the period in
which the impact of such matters is determined or paid.  However, the Company understands that there
may be pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistle
blowers”, or other pending claims as to which the Company has not been provided
with a copy of the complaint and accordingly cannot determine the extent of any
potential liability.

As
a general matter, providers of clinical laboratory testing services may be
subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims.  These suits could involve claims for
substantial damages.  Any professional
liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on the Company’s client
base and reputation.  The Company
maintains various liability insurance coverage for claims that could result
from providing or failing to provide clinical laboratory testing services,
including inaccurate testing results and other exposures.  The Company’s insurance coverage limits its
maximum exposure on individual claims; however, the Company is essentially
self-insured for a significant portion of these claims.  The basis for claims reserves considers
actuarially determined losses based upon the Company’s historical and projected
loss experience.  Management believes
that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently
estimated exposures.  Although
management cannot predict the outcome of any claims made against the Company,
management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of any such
proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition but may be material to the Company’s results of operations
or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such claims is determined or
paid.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The
  Company’s clinical laboratory testing business currently represents its
  one reportable business segment. The clinical laboratory testing business accounts
  for approximately 95% of consolidated net revenues in each of the three years
  ended December 31, 2005. Clinical laboratory testing is an essential element
  in the delivery of healthcare services. Physicians use laboratory tests to assist
  in the detection, diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring and treatment of diseases
  and other medical conditions. Clinical laboratory testing is generally categorized
  as clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing. Clinical testing is performed
  on body fluids, such as blood and urine. Anatomic pathology testing is performed
  on tissues, including biopsies, and other samples, such as human cells. Customers
  of the clinical laboratory testing business include patients, physicians, hospitals,
  employers, governmental institutions and other commercial clinical laboratories.

All
  other operating segments include the Company’s non-clinical laboratory
  testing businesses and consist of its risk assessment services business, its
  clinical trials testing business, its test kit manufacturing subsidiary, NID,
  and its healthcare information technology business, MedPlus. The Company’s
  risk assessment business, acquired as part of the LabOne acquisition in 2005
  (see Note 3), provides underwriting support services to the life insurance industry
  including teleunderwriting, specimen collection and paramedical examinations,
  laboratory testing, medical record retrieval, motor vehicle reports, telephone
  inspections and credit checks. The Company’s clinical trials testing business
  provides clinical laboratory testing performed in connection with clinical research
  trials on new drugs. NID manufactures and markets diagnostic test kits and systems.
  MedPlus is a developer and integrator of clinical connectivity and data management
  solutions for healthcare organizations, physicians and clinicians.

Substantially
  all of the Company’s services are provided within the United States, and
  substantially all of the Company’s assets are located within the United
  States. No one customer accounted for ten percent or more of net revenues in
  2005, 2004, or 2003.

The
  following table is a summary of segment information for the years ended December
  31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Segment asset information is not presented since it
  is not reported to or used by the chief operating decision maker at the operating
  segment level. Operating earnings (loss) of each segment represents net revenues
  less directly identifiable expenses to arrive at operating income for the segment.
  General management and administrative corporate expenses, including amortization
  of intangible assets, are included in general corporate expenses below. The
  accounting policies of the segments are the same as those of the Company as
  set forth in Note 2.

During
        2005, the Company recorded a $6.2 million charge primarily related to
        forgiving amounts owed by patients and physicians, and related property
        damage as a result of the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast.

(b)

During
        2003, operating income includes $3.3 million of gains on the sale of certain
        operating assets, partially offset by a $1.1 million charge associated
        with the integration of Unilab (See Note 4).

(c)

During
        the fourth quarter of 2005, NID instituted its second product hold due
        to quality issues. The hold remains in effect for substantially all of
        NID’s products while NID works to address the issues and return product
        to market. The latest product hold has caused the Company to reevaluate
        the financial outlook for NID. As a result of this analysis, the Company
        recorded a charge of $16 million in the fourth quarter to write off certain
        of NID’s assets. The charge includes the write-off of all of the
        goodwill associated with NID of $7.5 million and other write-offs totaling
        $8.5 million, principally related to products and equipment inventory.
        In addition, during the second quarter of 2005, in connection with its
        first product hold, NID recorded a charge of approximately $3 million,
        principally related to products and equipment inventory. These charges,
        coupled with the operating losses at NID stemming from the product holds,
        together with the costs to rectify NID’s quality issues and comply
        with an ongoing government investigation and regulatory review of NID,
        have reduced operating income compared to the prior year by approximately
        $50 million.

(d)

During
        2004, the Company recorded a $10.3 million charge associated with the
        acceleration of certain pension obligations in connection with the succession
        of the Company’s prior CEO.

In
conjunction with the Company’s Secured Receivables Credit Facility described in
Note 10, the Company maintains a wholly owned non-guarantor subsidiary, Quest
Diagnostics Receivables Incorporated (“QDRI”).
Through March 31, 2004, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, with
the exception of American Medical Laboratories, Incorporated (“AML”) and
Unilab, transferred all private domestic receivables (principally excluding
receivables due from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs, and
receivables due from customers of its joint ventures) to QDRI.  Effective with the second quarter of 2004,
the Company and Subsidiary Guarantors, including AML and Unilab, transfer all
private domestic receivables to QDRI.
However, LabOne, which was acquired by Quest Diagnostics on November 1,
2005 (see Note 3), does not transfer its private domestic receivables to
QDRI.  QDRI utilizes the transferred
receivables to collateralize the Company’s Secured Receivables Credit
Facility.  The Company and the
Subsidiary Guarantors provide collection services to QDRI.  QDRI uses cash collections principally to
purchase new receivables from the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors.

The
following condensed consolidating financial data illustrates the composition of
the combined guarantors.  Investments in
subsidiaries are accounted for by the parent using the equity method for
purposes of the supplemental consolidating presentation.  Earnings (losses) of subsidiaries are

relate to
investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions.   On February 28, 2003, Quest Diagnostics
acquired Unilab (see Note 3), which has been included in the accompanying
condensed consolidating financial data, subsequent to the closing of the
acquisition, as a Subsidiary Guarantor. LabOne has been included in the
accompanying condensed consolidating financial data, subsequent to the closing
of the acquisition, as a Subsidiary Guarantor.
