PART I

Item 1.

Business

The Company

Campbell Soup Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (Campbell or the company), is a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products. Campbell was organized as a business corporation under the laws of New Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through predecessor organizations, it traces its heritage in the food business back to 1869. The company’s principal executive offices are in Camden, New Jersey 08103-1799.

Background

On August 6, 2012, the company completed the acquisition of BF Bolthouse Holdco LLC (Bolthouse Farms) for approximately $1.55 billion in cash. Based in Bakersfield, California, Bolthouse Farms is a vertically integrated food and beverage company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing fresh carrots and proprietary, high value-added healthy products.

On June 13, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Plum PBC (formerly Plum Inc.) (Plum) for approximately

$249 million

, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Based in Emeryville, California, Plum is a leading provider of premium, organic foods and snacks that serve the nutritional needs of babies, toddlers and children. The

Plum

Organics

brand is the No. 4 brand of baby food in the U.S. and the No. 2 brand of organic baby food in the U.S. The acquisition provides the company with an attractive platform to extend its core categories of simple meals, snacks and beverages and enhances the company's access to a new generation of consumers. Since the Plum acquisition occurred on June 13, 2013, only the results of operations of Plum from June 13, 2013 through July 28, 2013 are included in this 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Report).

On August 8, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Kelsen Group A/S (Kelsen) for approximately

$325 million

, subject to customary purchase price adjustments.  Based in Nørre Snede, Denmark, Kelsen is a producer of quality baked snacks that are sold in 85 countries around the world. Its primary brands include

Kjeldsens

and

Royal Dansk

. Kelsen has established distribution networks in markets in Asia, the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, South America and Africa, and it is a market leader in the assortment segment of the sweet biscuits category in China and Hong Kong. The Kelsen acquisition provides the company with an immediate opportunity for growth in the large baked snacks category in China. Kelsen employs approximately 350 persons, and  its two primary manufacturing facilities are company-owned and located in Nørre Snede and Ribe, Denmark. Since the Kelsen acquisition occurred subsequent to 2013, the results of Kelsen's operations are not included in this Report, and the discussion of the company's business and operations in this Report does not incorporate Kelsen's business and operations unless specifically stated otherwise.

On August 12, 2013, the company announced that it is in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of its simple meal business in Europe to CVC Capital Partners, a leading global private equity firm. CVC has made a firm offer to purchase the business. The proposed transaction includes the company's simple meal national brands, including

Liebig

and

Royco

in France,

Erasco

in Germany,

Blå Band

in Sweden and

Devos Lemmens

and

Royco

in Belgium. The proposal also includes the sale of four plants in Puurs, Belgium; Le Pontet, France; Lubeck, Germany; and Kristianstadt, Sweden. The proposed transaction does not include the export of Pepperidge Farm products throughout Europe, Campbell’s products in the United Kingdom or Kelsen. The company has the option to cause the parties to execute a binding share purchase agreement. The proposed transaction is subject to clearance by the relevant European competition law authorities. The company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. The assets and liabilities of the European business have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

July 28, 2013

. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.

Reportable Segments

The company reports the results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Simple Meals; Global Baking and Snacking; International Simple Meals and Beverages; U.S. Beverages; and Bolthouse and Foodservice. The company has


operating segments based on product type and geographic location and has aggregated the operating segments into the appropriate reportable segment based on similar economic characteristics; products; production processes; types or classes of customers; distribution methods; and regulatory environment. See also Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The segments are discussed in greater detail below.

U.S. Simple Meals

The U.S. Simple Meals segment aggregates the following operating segments: U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. The U.S. Soup retail business includes the following products:

Campbell’s

condensed and ready-to-serve soups; and

Swanson

broth and stocks. The U.S. Sauces retail business includes the following products:

Prego

pasta sauces;

Pace

Mexican sauces;

Campbell’s

canned gravies, pasta, and beans;

Swanson

canned poultry; and as of June 13, 2013,

Plum Organics

foods and snacks.


Global Baking and Snacking

The Global Baking and Snacking segment aggregates the following operating segments:

Pepperidge Farm

cookies, crackers, bakery and frozen products in U.S. retail; and

Arnott’s

biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific.

International Simple Meals and Beverages

The International Simple Meals and Beverages segment aggregates the simple meals and beverages operating segments outside of the U.S., including the retail business in Canada and the businesses in Asia Pacific, Latin America and China. In Canada, the segment’s operations include

Habitant

and

Campbell’s

soups,

Prego

pasta sauces,

Pace

Mexican sauces,

V8

juices and beverages and certain Pepperidge Farm products. In Asia Pacific, the segment's operations include

Campbell’s

soup and stock,

Kimball

sauces,

V8

juices and beverages,

Prego

pasta sauce and

Swanson

broths. As previously discussed, on August 12, 2013, the company announced that it is in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of its simple meal brands in Europe. The European simple meal business was historically included in this segment. The results of operations for the European simple meal business are reflected as discontinued operations for the years presented in this Report, and the assets of the business have been reflected as assets held for sale as of

July 28, 2013

.

Bolthouse and Foodservice

Bolthouse and Foodservice comprises the Bolthouse Farms carrot products operating segment, including fresh carrots, juice concentrate and fiber; the Bolthouse Farms super-premium refrigerated beverages and refrigerated salad dressings operating segment; and the North America Foodservice operating segment. The North America Foodservice operating segment represents the distribution of products such as soup, specialty entrées, beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm products through various food service channels in the U.S. and Canada. None of these operating segments meets the criteria for aggregation nor the thresholds for separate disclosure.

Ingredients and Packaging

The ingredient and packaging materials required for the manufacture of the company’s food products are purchased from various suppliers. These items are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors, including changes in crop size, cattle cycles, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, energy costs, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements and regional drought and other weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change) during the growing and harvesting seasons. To help reduce some of this price volatility, the company uses a combination of purchase orders, short- and long-term contracts and various commodity risk management tools for most of its ingredients and packaging. Ingredient inventories are at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring. Since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only at certain seasons, the company makes commitments for the purchase of such ingredients during their respective seasons. At this time, the company does not anticipate any material restrictions on availability or shortages of ingredients or packaging that would have a significant impact on the company’s businesses. For information on the impact of inflation on the company, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Customers

In most of the company’s markets, sales and merchandising activities are conducted through the company’s own sales force and its third-party broker and distributor partners. In the U.S., Canada and Latin America, the company’s products are generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores, drug stores, dollar stores and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. In the Asia Pacific region, the company’s products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains, convenience stores and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. The company makes shipments promptly after receipt and acceptance of orders.

The company's five largest customers accounted for approximately

36%

of the company's consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2013, and

37%

in 2012 and 2011. The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately

19%

of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2013 and 2012 and

18%

in 2011. All of the company’s segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net sales.

Trademarks and Technology

As of September 13, 2013, the company owned over 4,400

trademark registrations and applications in over 170 countries, including the registrations acquired in the Plum and Kelsen acquisitions and those associated with its European simple meal business. The company believes its trademarks are of material importance to its business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. The company believes that its principal brands, including

Campbell's, Pepperidge Farm, Goldfish, V8, Pace, Prego, Swanson, Arnott's

and

Bolthouse Farms,

as well as the

Plum

brand acquired in the Plum acquisition and the

Kjeldsens

and

Royal Dansk

brands


acquired in the Kelsen acquisition, are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used. In addition, some of the company's products are sold under brands that have been licensed from third parties.

Although the company owns a number of valuable patents, it does not regard any segment of its business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, the company owns copyrights, both registered and unregistered, and proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Competition

The company experiences worldwide competition in all of its principal products. This competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories, and includes producers of generic and private label products, as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers. All of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. The number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service.

Working Capital

For information relating to the company’s cash and working capital items, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Capital Expenditures

During 2013, the company’s aggregate capital expenditures were

$336 million

. The company expects to spend approximately

$350 million

for capital projects in 2014. Major 2014 capital projects include a Pepperidge Farm cracker capacity expansion project, a U.S. beverage relocation and refurbishment project, the ongoing implementation of a series of related initiatives to simplify the soup-making process in North America (also known as the soup common platform initiative), and a flexible production line for Bolthouse Farms.

Research and Development

During the last three fiscal years, the company’s expenditures on research and development activities relating to new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing products were

$128 million

in 2013,

$116 million

in 2012, and

$120 million

in 2011. The increase from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and benefit costs, the addition of Bolthouse Farms expenses and higher costs associated with product innovation in North America. The decrease from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and other factors, partially offset by higher costs associated with product innovation in North America and the Asia Pacific region and inflation.

Environmental Matters

The company has requirements for the operation and design of its facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations. Of the company’s

$336 million

in capital expenditures made during 2013, approximately $15 million was for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the U.S.  The company further estimates that approximately $14 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2014 will be for compliance with U.S. environmental laws and regulations. The company believes that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (both within the U.S. and elsewhere) will not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the company. In addition, the company continues to monitor pending environmental laws and regulations within the U.S. and elsewhere, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. While the impact of these pending laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, the company does not believe that compliance with these pending laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the company.

Seasonality

Demand for the company’s products is somewhat seasonal, with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume due primarily to demand for the company’s soup products. Demand for the company’s sauce, beverage, baking and snacking products, however, is generally evenly distributed throughout the year.

Employees

On

July 28, 2013

, there were approximately 20,000 employees of the company.  In addition, as of

July 28, 2013

, Campbell Swire, the company's joint venture in China, employed approximately 170 persons.

Financial Information

Financial information for the company’s reportable segments and geographic areas is found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For risks attendant to the company’s foreign operations, see “Risk Factors.”

Company Website

The company’s primary corporate website can be found at

www.campbellsoupcompany.com

. The company makes available free of charge at this website (under the “Investor Center — Financial Information — SEC Filings” caption) all of its reports


(including amendments) filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and its current reports on Form 8-K. These reports are made available on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after their filing with, or furnishing to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial also may impair the company’s business operations and financial condition.

The company operates in a highly competitive industry

The company operates in the highly competitive food industry and experiences international competition in all of its principal products. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. A number of the company's primary competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to the company's marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in the company reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share.

The company's results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives and

acceptance by consumers of the company's products, including new or improved product and packaging introductions

The company's results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the company's products. The company's new or improved product and packaging introductions, along with its other marketplace initiatives, are designed to capitalize on customer or consumer trends. In order to remain successful, the company must anticipate and react to these trends and develop new or improved products or packaging to address them. While the company devotes significant resources to meeting this goal, the company may not be successful in developing new or improved products or packaging, or its new or improved products or packaging may not be accepted by customers or consumers.

The company's results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully

The company's ability to meet its objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on its ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers, negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms, and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Potential risks of acquisitions also include the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into the company's existing operations, diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses, potential assumption of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with the sellers, potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, and the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which the company has limited or no prior experience.  Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges and increase the company's exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes. For divestitures, potential risks may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from the company effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. The company's business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed.

Disruption to the company's supply chain could adversely affect its business

The company's ability to manufacture and/or sell its products may be impaired by damage or disruption to its manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of its suppliers or contract manufacturers, as a result of adverse weather conditions (such as drought, temperature extremes or floods), natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes or other events. Production of carrots by the company's Bolthouse Farms business may be also be adversely affected by water scarcity, crop disease and crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect the company's business or financial results, particularly in circumstances where a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect the company's ability to manufacture and/or sell its products, as well as its business or financial results.

The company's non-U.S. operations pose additional risks to the company's business

In 2013, approximately 23% of the company's consolidated net sales from continuing operations were generated outside of the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales. The company's business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the U.S., including but not limited to the following:

•

political instability;


•

unfavorable changes in tariffs or export and import restrictions;

•

nationalization of operations;

•

failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

•

the adverse impact of foreign tax treaties and policies;

•

civil disobedience, armed hostilities and terrorist acts; and

•

restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from countries outside of the United States, including potentially negative tax consequences.

In addition, the company holds assets and incurs liabilities, generates revenue, and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. The company's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and the company must translate its assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the company's consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.

The company faces risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions

and other economic conditions

Customer and consumer demand for the company's products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact the company's ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could impact the company.

Increased regulation could adversely affect the company's business or financial results

The manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. The primary areas of regulation include the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of the company's food products, as well as the health and safety of the company's employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., the company is subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. The company is also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. and by voluntary organizations, such as the National Advertising Division and the Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. Changes in regulatory requirements, or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.

The company's results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and

packaging materials

The raw and packaging materials used in the company's business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change), import and export requirements and changes in government-sponsored agricultural programs. To the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices, the company may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through its commodity hedging activity.

Price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace

The company intends to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of some of its products. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent the price increases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, the company's business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.

The company may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of its customers

In recent years, alternative retail grocery channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores and club stores, have increased their market share. This trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. In addition, consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers. These customers may use more of their


shelf space for their private label products. If the company is unable to use its scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted. Also, during 2013, the company's five largest customers accounted for approximately

36%

of the company's consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately

19%

of the company's consolidated net sales. The disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of the company's other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.

The company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to

its defined benefit pension plans

The company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the U.S. and various non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of the company's defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in the company's obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company.

The company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, its

information technology systems

Each year the company engages in several billion dollars of transactions with its customers and vendors. Because the amount of dollars involved is so significant, the company's information technology resources (some of which are managed by third parties) must provide connections among its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, and accounting functions. If the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure and to maintain the related computerized and manual control processes, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches (including the theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), cyber-based attacks or other system failures. If the company is unable to prevent such failures, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted.

The company may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits

from, its ongoing supply chain, information technology or other initiatives

The company's success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information technology and other initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient, which is necessary in the company's highly competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an interruption to the company's sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service or accounting functions.

If the company's food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, the company

might need to recall those items, and may experience product liability claims if

consumers are injured

The company may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled. The company may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. The company could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against it. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to the company's reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the company's products. In addition, the company's results could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the company's products, ingredients or packaging, even in the absence of a recall or a product liability case.

The company's results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of its brands

The company has a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of the company's business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on the company's ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that the company has acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about the company's products and/or ingredients (whether or not valid), the company's failure to maintain the quality of its products, the failure of the company's products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about the company, its brands or products on social or digital media could seriously damage the company's brands and reputation.  If the company does not maintain the favorable perception of its brands, the company's results could be negatively impacted.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

Description of the Company

Campbell Soup Company is a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products. The company reports the results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Simple Meals; Global Baking and Snacking; International Simple Meals and Beverages; U.S. Beverages; and Bolthouse and Foodservice.

On August 6, 2012, the company completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms from a fund managed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity firm, for $

1.550 billion

in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. On August 6, 2012, the preliminary purchase price adjustments resulted in an increase in the purchase price of

$20 million

. In the third quarter, the purchase price adjustments were finalized and reduced to

$11 million

. The company funded the acquisition through a combination of short- and long-term borrowings. See Notes 3 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the acquisition.

On June 13, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Plum for

$249 million

, subject to customary purchase price adjustments.  Plum is a leading provider of premium, organic foods and snacks that serve the nutritional needs of babies, toddlers and children. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the acquisition.

On August 12, 2013, the company announced that it is in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of its simple meals business in Europe. The company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The assets and liabilities of the European business have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

July 28, 2013

. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Key Strategies

Campbell's long-term goal is to create shareowner value by driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth. The company is seeking to achieve this goal by increasing the strength of its core business and by expanding into higher-growth spaces, including new consumer segments, categories, channels and geographies.

Campbell is focused in three core categories: simple meals, healthy beverages and snacks. Its strategic priorities are to profitably grow its soup and simple meals business in North America, expand its international presence, and continue to drive growth in snacks and healthy beverages. In 2013, the company made meaningful progress in advancing these objectives.

In managing its core soup and simple meals business in North America, Campbell seeks to align investment in each business in the portfolio with the growth potential of the category and the brand. It grew net sales and operating earnings in U.S. Soup in 2013 by improving execution and optimizing key drivers of demand, including brand positioning, communication, merchandising and pricing, taste, distribution and innovation.

In 2014, Campbell will continue its efforts to strengthen its North American business through improved execution, brand building and innovation. It plans to introduce more than 30 new soup products, ranging from a new line of

Campbell's Homestyle

ready-to-eat soups to flavor-infused

Swanson

broths. It will expand its presence in the dinner sauce category with the launch of

Campbell's

Slow Cooker sauces. It will also focus on driving growth in its new Plum business, a line of premium, organic foods and snacks for babies, toddlers and young children, which the company acquired in 2013.

In 2013, Campbell also acquired Bolthouse Farms, a business that gives the company a strong platform for access to packaged fresh segments that are aligned with significant consumer trends. In combination, Bolthouse Farms' beverages business and the


company's line of

V8

branded beverages provide Campbell with a healthy beverages portfolio that spans the range from shelf-stable value offerings to mainstream products to fresh, super-premium beverages. In 2014, Campbell expects to continue to drive growth in Bolthouse Farms by leveraging its robust innovation pipeline and by investing in brand building. It plans to improve the performance of its

V8

beverages business through disciplined focus on the drivers of demand, continued expansion in energy drinks and other growth segments in the shelf-stable beverages category, and close attention to cost management. The introduction of

V8 Harvest

, a fresh tomato-based 100% vegetable juice, will represent the first entry of the

V8

brand into the super-premium beverage segment.

In Campbell's baking and snacking portfolio, Pepperidge Farm expects continued growth in 2014, driven primarily by its cracker business. With the introduction of

Goldfish

Puffs

, a puffed cheese snack product designed primarily for teens, Pepperidge Farm will begin to expand the

Goldfish

brand into adjacent categories. At Arnott's in Australia, the company will focus on growing the core biscuits business with innovative flavors and new pack sizes and on driving productivity and reducing costs.

Campbell is seeking to expand its presence in international markets by extending the product platforms of many of its current businesses and by pursuing business development opportunities in faster-growing developing markets. In 2014, the company intends to leverage new strategic alliances in Mexico with Grupo Jumex and Conservas La Costeña to drive profitable growth in beverages, soups and simple meals through access to expanded manufacturing and distribution capabilities. In Indonesia, it plans to continue to drive growth in biscuits through increased penetration in the general trade. In Malaysia, it will focus on improved in-store execution behind its

Prego

and

Kimball

sauce brands. The company's acquisition of Kelsen during the first quarter of 2014 provides an immediate opportunity for growth in the large baked snacks category in China.

Executive Summary

•

Net sales

increased

12%

in 2013 to

$8.052 billion

. The acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and Plum contributed 11 points of the growth.

•

Gross profit, as a percent of sales,

decreased

to

36.2%

from

39.2%

a year ago. The decline was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and the impact of restructuring-related costs recognized in the current year.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges" for additional information; and

•

Earnings from continuing operations were

$689 million

(

per share) in


, compared to

$734 million

($

2.29

per share) in


. After adjusting for restructuring charges and related costs and acquisition transaction costs, earnings increased in 2013 from 2012. The increase was primarily due to sales growth, lower marketing expenses, the impact of the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher administrative expenses and higher selling expenses. Earnings per share benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, reflecting the impact of the company’s strategic share repurchase program in 2012.

Net earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2012 Compared with 2011

In addition to the 2012 item that impacted comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share previously disclosed, the following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and earnings per share:

Continuing Operations

•

In 2011, the company announced a series of initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce overhead costs across the organization to help fund plans to drive the growth of the business. The company also announced its exit from the Russian market. In 2012, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of  $7 million ($4 million after tax or $.01 per share) related to the initiatives.

per share) in


, compared to

$752 million

(

$2.26

per share) in


. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings decreased  in 2012 from 2011.  The decrease was primarily due to a decline in gross margin percentage partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. The decline in gross margin was due to cost inflation, increased promotional spending and unfavorable mix, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements. Earnings per share benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which was primarily due to share repurchases under the company’s strategic share repurchase programs.

Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests

The company owns a

60%

controlling interest in a joint venture formed with Swire Pacific Limited to support the development of the company’s business in China. The joint venture began operations on January 31, 2011.

(2)

Sum of the individual amounts does not add due to rounding.

In 2013, U.S. Simple Meals sales

increased

5%

, reflecting increases in U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. U.S. Soup sales increased 5%, benefiting from improved execution and the favorable impact of weather. Further details of U.S. Soup include:

•

Sales of

Campbell’s

condensed soups increased 2% with gains in both cooking and eating varieties.

•

Sales of ready-to-serve soups increased 9% due to volume-driven gains in

Campbell's

Chunky

canned soups, which benefited from new varieties, increased promotional spending and a return to NFL-themed advertising.

•

Broth sales increased 4%, primarily driven by double-digit gains in aseptically packaged broth, partially offset by lower sales of canned products and lower sales of

Swanson

Flavor Boost

concentrated broth, which was introduced in 2012.

U.S. Sauces sales increased 5% primarily due to the acquisition of Plum in June 2013, growth in

Prego

pasta sauces, the 2013 launch of

Campbell's

Skillet Sauces, and growth in

Pace

Mexican sauces, partially offset by lower sales in other simple meals products.

In 2012, U.S. Simple Meals sales decreased 1%. U.S. Soup declined 2% as lower volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices, reflecting a continued cautious consumer environment. Further details of U.S. Soup include:

•

Sales of

Campbell’s

condensed soups increased 1% due to gains in eating varieties as cooking varieties were comparable to a year ago.

•

Sales of ready-to-serve soups decreased 7%.  Ready-to-serve soup volumes were impacted by the company's shift to improve price realization through higher selling prices and reduced promotional spending.  The introduction of

Campbell’s Slow Kettle

soups in July 2011 positively impacted sales performance.

•

Broth sales increased 3% primarily due to volume gains and the introduction of

Swanson Flavor Boost

concentrated broth, which launched in July 2011.

U.S. Sauces sales increased slightly as gains in

Prego

pasta sauces were mostly offset by declines in sales of

Pace

Mexican sauces and other simple meal products. Sales of

Pace

Mexican sauces were negatively impacted by increased private label competitive activity. In U.S. Sauces, promotional spending was increased to improve marketplace performance.

In 2013, Global Baking and Snacking sales

increased

4%

with gains in both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's. Pepperidge Farm sales increased primarily due to growth in fresh bakery products,

Goldfish

snack crackers, and cookies. Sales of fresh bakery products benefited from improved marketplace performance and increased shelf space at retail outlets resulting from the bankruptcy of a competitor.  Arnott’s sales increased primarily due to gains in Indonesia, partially offset by the impact of currency.  Promotional


spending was increased by Pepperidge Farm for competitive reasons and to capitalize on the opportunity to increase shelf space in the U.S. bread category and in Arnott's to remain competitive in the Australian marketplace.

In 2012, Global Baking and Snacking sales increased 2% as sales growth in Pepperidge Farm was partially offset by a decline in Arnott's. Sales at Pepperidge Farm reflected higher selling prices across the product portfolio, partly offset by increased promotional spending. Sales increased at double-digit rates in

Goldfish

snack crackers, and declined in cookies and frozen products. Sales at Arnott's declined reflecting an increase in promotional spending as the business was impacted by a difficult customer and consumer environment.

In 2013, International Simple Meals and Beverages sales were comparable to 2012. Sales declines in the Asia Pacific region, primarily due to currency and declines in exports, were partially offset by gains in China, Canada and Latin America. Promotional spending was increased

,

primarily to support the soup business in Canada, in response to more intense price competition in the marketplace.

In 2012, International Simple Meals and Beverages sales decreased 2% due to declines in Canada partly offset by growth in export sales. In Canada, sales declined primarily due to lower soup sales and the impact of currency. Promotional spending was increased within the segment to improve marketplace performance.

In 2013, U.S. Beverages sales

decreased

4%

due to declines in sales of

V8

vegetable juice and

V8 V-Fusion

beverages, partially offset by an increase in

V8 Splash

beverages. Promotional spending was increased, primarily on

V8 Splash

, in response to more price-based competition in the value segment.

In 2012, U.S. Beverages sales increased 2%. Sales of

V8 Splash

beverages and

V8 V-Fusion

beverages increased, while sales of

V8

vegetable juice declined. Sales of

V8 V-Fusion

beverages benefited from a range of new products, including

V8 V-Fusion

Smoothies, Energy, Sparkling

and juice boxes, as well as increased promotional support.

In 2013, Bolthouse and Foodservice sales increased due to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms in 2013, which contributed

$756 million

to sales. North America Foodservice sales declined 8% primarily due to declines in frozen soup products, reflecting the loss of a major restaurant customer, and higher levels of trade spending to remain competitive.

In 2012, North America Foodservice sales increased 3% primarily due to gains in refrigerated soup.

Gross Profit

Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold,

increased

by

$102 million

and

decreased

by

$78 million

in 2012 from 2011. As a percent of sales, gross profit was

36.2%

in 2013,

39.2%

in 2012, and

40.4%

in 2011.

The

3.0

and

1.2

percentage-point decreases in gross margin percentage in


and  2012 were due to the following factors:

Marketing and Selling Expenses

Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were

11.8%

in


,

13.1%

in


, and

12.7%

in 2011. Marketing and selling expenses

increased

1%

in 2013 from 2012. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the Bolthouse Farms acquisition (approximately 3 percentage points); higher selling expenses (approximately 2 percentage points); and higher marketing expenses to support innovation efforts (approximately 2 percentage points), partially offset by lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, primarily in the U.S. Soup business (approximately 6 percentage points). Marketing and selling expenses increased 4% in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses (approximately 3 percentage points) and higher other marketing expenses (approximately 1 percentage point). Advertising and consumer promotion expenses increased 6% in 2012 from 2011, reflecting brand-building investments across many key brands.


Administrative Expenses

Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were

8.4%

in


,

8.1%

in


and 2011. Administrative expenses

increased

by

17%

in


from


, primarily due to the impact of the Bolthouse Farms acquisition (approximately 10 percentage points) and higher incentive compensation costs (approximately 7 percentage points). Administrative expenses increased 1% in 2012 from 2011, primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs (approximately 2 percentage points); and higher general administrative costs and inflation (approximately 3 percentage points), partially offset by cost savings from restructuring initiatives and other factors (approximately 4 percentage points).

Research and Development  Expenses

Research and development expenses

increased

$

12 million

or

10%

in 2013 from 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and benefit costs (approximately 7 percentage points); the impact of the Bolthouse Farms acquisition (approximately 2 percentage points); and higher costs associated with product innovation in North America (approximately 1 percentage point). Research and development expenses decreased $4 million or 3% in 2012 from 2011. The decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and other factors (approximately 6 percentage points), partially offset by higher costs associated with product innovation in North America and the Asia Pacific region (approximately 2 percentage points), and inflation (approximately 1 percentage point).

Other Expenses/(Income)

Other expenses in 2013 included $10 million of transaction costs and $14 million of  amortization of intangible assets  associated with the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms.

Other expenses in 2012 included $5 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms.

(1)

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges.

Earnings from U.S. Simple Meals

increased

11%

in 2013 versus 2012. The improvement in operating earnings was due to solid gains in U.S. Soup, partially offset by a decline in U.S. Sauces mostly due to increased marketing spending in support of new items. For the segment, higher selling prices and productivity savings were partially offset by cost inflation.

Earnings from U.S. Simple Meals in 2012 and 2011 were comparable, as earnings gains in U.S. Soup were mostly offset by declines in U.S. Sauces. For the segment, higher selling prices, productivity improvements and lower promotional spending were mostly offset by lower volumes and cost inflation.

Earnings from Global Baking and Snacking increased $1 million in 2013, reflecting growth in Pepperidge Farm mostly offset  by lower earnings in Arnott's.

Earnings from Global Baking and Snacking decreased 11% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to cost inflation, increased promotional spending and higher advertising expense, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements. Promotional spending was increased to support the businesses.

Earnings from International Simple Meals and Beverages

increased

2%

in 2013 versus 2012.  The increase was primarily due to lower losses in China, reflecting lower marketing expenses partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage.


Earnings from International Simple Meals and Beverages decreased 17% in 2012 versus 2011. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to lower earnings in the Asia Pacific region and Canada, and increased costs associated with the company's market expansion in China, partially offset by the benefit of exiting the Russian market.

Earnings from U.S. Beverages

decreased

10%

in 2013 versus 2012, primarily due to lower sales and a lower gross margin percentage, partially offset by reduced advertising expenses.

Earnings from U.S. Beverages decreased 26% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to cost inflation, increased promotional spending and advertising expense, partly offset by productivity improvements.

Earnings from Bolthouse and Foodservice

increased

$31 million in 2013 from 2012 due to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, which contributed $63 million, partially offset by lower earnings in North America Foodservice resulting from the decline in sales.

Earnings from Bolthouse and Foodservice increased 4% in 2012 versus 2011 due to higher selling prices and productivity improvements, partially offset by cost inflation.  In 2012 and 2011, all of the segment earnings were from North America Foodservice as Bolthouse was acquired in 2013.

Unallocated corporate expenses in 2013 included restructuring-related costs of $91 million and transaction costs of $10 million associated with the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms. Unallocated corporate expenses in 2012 included $5 million associated with the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms.  The remaining increase in 2013 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs.

Interest Expense/Income

Interest expense

increased

to

$135 million

in


from

$114 million

in


, reflecting a higher debt level due to the Bolthouse Farms acquisition, partially offset by lower interest rates.  Interest income

increased

to

$10 million

from

$8 million

in


primarily due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents.

Interest expense decreased to $114 million in 2012 from $122 million in 2011, primarily due to lower interest rates on fixed-rate debt. Interest income decreased to $8 million in 2012 from $10 million in 2011 primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents.

Taxes on Earnings

The effective tax rate was

28.8%

in 2013, 31.0% in 2012, and

31.9%

in 2011. The current year included a tax benefit of $55 million on $152 million of restructuring charges and related costs and acquisition transaction costs. The decline in the effective tax rate in 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to lower state taxes, including the favorable resolution of certain matters, and an increase in the U.S. manufacturing deduction.

The reduction in the effective tax rate in 2012 from 2011 was primarily due to lower tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2012.

The company implemented  initiatives to improve its U.S. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across its U.S. thermal plant network, including closing its thermal plant in Sacramento, California, which produced soups, sauces and beverages. The closure resulted in the elimination of approximately


full-time positions and was completed in phases. Most of the positions were eliminated in 2013 and operations ceased in August 2013. The company shifted the majority of Sacramento's soup, sauce and beverage production to its thermal plants in Maxton, North Carolina; Napoleon, Ohio; and Paris, Texas. The company also closed its spice plant in South Plainfield, New Jersey, which resulted in the elimination of


positions. The company consolidated spice production at its Milwaukee, Wisconsin, plant in 2013.

•

In Mexico, the company entered into commercial arrangements with third-party providers to expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities. The third-party providers will produce and distribute the company's beverages, soups, broths and sauces throughout the Mexican market. As a result of these agreements, the company will close its plant in Villagrán, Mexico, in 2014 and eliminate approximately


positions.

•

The company will improve its Pepperidge Farm bakery supply chain cost structure by closing its plant in Aiken, South Carolina, in 2014. The company will shift the majority of  Aiken's bread production to its bakery plant in Lakeland, Florida.  Approximately 110 positions will be eliminated as a result of the plant closure.

•

The company streamlined its salaried workforce in U.S. Simple Meals, North America Foodservice and U.S. Beverages by approximately 70 positions. This action was substantially completed in August 2013.


The company recorded a restructuring charge of

$51 million

related to these initiatives in 2013. In addition, approximately

$91 million

of costs related to these initiatives were recorded in Cost of products sold, representing accelerated depreciation and other exit costs. The aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and related costs was

$90 million

, or

$.28

per share. A summary of the pre-tax costs and remaining costs associated with the initiatives is as follows:

Of the aggregate

$150 million

of pre-tax costs, the company expects approximately

$47 million

will be cash expenditures. In addition, the company expects to invest approximately

$31 million

in capital expenditures, primarily to relocate and refurbish a beverage filling and packaging line, and relocate bread production, of which approximately $12 million has been invested as of

July 28, 2013

. The outstanding aspects of these restructuring initiatives are expected to be completed in 2014. The remaining cash outflows related to these restructuring initiatives are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company’s liquidity.

The initiatives included in this program, once fully implemented, are expected to generate annual ongoing pre-tax savings of approximately $40 million beginning in 2015, with 2014 savings of approximately $30 million.

The total pre-tax costs of

$150 million

associated with segments are expected to be as follows: U.S. Simple Meals -

$91 million

; Global Baking and Snacking -

$16 million

; International Simple Meals and Beverages -

$10 million

; U.S. Beverages -

$31 million

; and Bolthouse and Foodservice -

$2 million

. Segment operating results do not include restructuring charges as segment performance is evaluated excluding such charges.

2011 Initiatives

In the fourth quarter of 2011, the company announced a series of initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce overhead costs across the organization to help fund plans to drive the growth of the business. The company also announced its exit from the Russian market. Details of the initiatives include:

•

In Australia, the company is investing in a new system to automate packing operations at its biscuit plant in Virginia. This investment continued through 2013 and will result in the elimination of approximately


positions. This initiative is now expected to be substantially completed by December 2013. Further, the company improved asset utilization in the U.S. by shifting production of ready-to-serve soups from Paris, Texas, to other facilities in 2012. In addition, the manufacturing facility in Marshall, Michigan, was closed in 2011, and manufacturing of

Campbell’s Soup at Hand

microwavable products was consolidated at the Maxton, North Carolina, plant in 2012.

•

The company streamlined its salaried workforce by approximately


positions around the world, including approximately


positions at its world headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.  These actions were substantially completed in 2011. As part of this initiative, the company outsourced a larger portion of its U.S. retail merchandising activities to its retail sales agent, Acosta Sales and Marketing, and eliminated approximately


positions.

•

In connection with exiting the Russian market, the company eliminated approximately


positions. The exit process commenced in 2011 and was substantially completed in 2012.

In

Potential Future Initiatives

The

company continues to evaluate initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term profitability and may take additional actions in the future as a result.

Discontinued Operations

On August 12, 2013, the company announced that it is in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of its simple meals business in Europe. The European business includes

Erasco

and

Heisse Tasse

soups in Germany;

Liebig

and

Royco

soups in France;

Devos Lemmens

mayonnaise and cold sauces

;

and

Royco

soups in Belgium; and

Blå Band

and

Isomitta

soups and sauces in Sweden.

The company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.

Results of the European business are summarized below.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company recorded an impairment charge on the intangible assets of this business of

$396

million (

$263

million after tax or

$.83

per share).

In addition, the company recorded

$18 million

in tax expense (

$.06

per share) representing taxes on the difference between the book value and tax basis of the business.  See also Notes 4 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In 2013, sales were comparable to 2012 as gains in France, Belgium and the Nordic region were offset by declines in Germany and export sales.  Excluding the impairment charge and the tax charge, earnings increased in 2013 due primarily to lower marketing spending and administrative costs.

In 2012, sales declined primarily due to currency and declines in Germany. In 2012, earnings declined primarily due to lower sales, a lower gross margin percentage and restructuring charges, partially offset by lower marketing spending.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The company expects that foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements, including cash outflows to repay debt, pay dividends and fund pension plan contributions, will be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings under its shelf registration statement; short-term borrowings, including commercial paper; and cash and cash equivalents. The company believes that its sources of financing will be adequate to meet its future liquidity and capital resource requirements.

The company generated cash from operations of

$1.019 billion

in


, compared to

$1.120 billion

in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to higher working capital requirements, partly offset by higher cash earnings.

The company generated cash from operations of

$1.120 billion

in 2012, compared to $1.142 billion in 2011. The decline was primarily due to lower cash earnings, partially offset by lower pension contributions in 2012.

Capital expenditures were

$336 million

in


compared to

$323 million

a year ago. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately

$350 million

in


.  Capital expenditures in


included the soup capacity expansion project for the North America Foodservice business (approximately $42 million), capacity expansion at Pepperidge Farm (approximately $38 million), the packing automation and capacity expansion projects at one of the company’s Australian biscuit plants (approximately $19


million), the ongoing initiative to simplify the soup-making process in North America (also known as the soup common platform initiative) (approximately $20 million), and an advanced planning system in North America (approximately $11 million). Capital expenditures in


included the packing automation and capacity expansion projects at one of the company’s Australian biscuit plants (approximately $32 million), an advanced planning system in North America (approximately $14 million), capacity expansion at Pepperidge Farm (approximately $18 million), the ongoing initiative to simplify the soup-making process in North America (approximately $17 million), continued enhancement of the company’s corporate headquarters (approximately $11 million), and Pepperidge Farm's 34,000-square-foot innovation center (approximately $20 million). Capital expenditures in


included the expansion of beverage capacity (approximately $6 million); the ongoing implementation of SAP (approximately $13 million); expenditures at the company’s corporate headquarters (approximately $6 million); Pepperidge Farm’s new 34,000-square-foot innovation center (approximately $5 million); expansion of Pepperidge Farm’s production capacity (approximately $5 million) and a number of infrastructure projects in the U.S. supply chain (approximately $31 million).

On August 6, 2012, the company completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms from a fund managed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity firm, for

$1.550 billion

in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. On August 6, 2012, the preliminary purchase price adjustments resulted in an increase in the purchase price of

$20 million

. In the third quarter, the purchase price adjustments were finalized and reduced to

$11 million

. The acquisition was funded through a combination of short- and long-term borrowings. The terms of long-term borrowings, which were issued on August 2, 2012, were as follows:

•

$400 million

floating rate notes that mature on

August 1, 2014

2.50%

notes that mature on

August 2, 2022

. Interest is payable semi-annually and commenced on              February 2, 2013. The company may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early redemption; and

•

$400 million

of

3.80%

notes that mature on

August 2, 2042

The remaining balance was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.

On June 13, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Plum for

$249 million

, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Plum is a leading provider of premium, organic foods and snacks that serve the nutritional needs of babies, toddlers and children. The acquisition provides the company with a new growth platform in the high-growth premium organic segment. The acquisition was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.

On August 8, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Kelsen for approximately

$325 million

, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Kelsen is a producer of quality baked snacks that are sold in 85 countries around the world. The acquisition was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.

Long-term borrowings in 2011 included the issuance in April of $500 million of 4.25% notes that mature in April 2021. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for the repayment of commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes.

, the company had

$1.909 billion

of short-term borrowings due within one year and

$40 million

of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. The company has committed revolving credit facilities totaling $2.0 billion,  comprised of a $500 million facility and a $1.5 billion facility, both maturing in September 2016. These facilities remained unused at

July 28, 2013

, except for

$3 million

of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. These revolving credit agreements support the company’s commercial paper programs and other general corporate purposes. The company may also increase the commitments under the credit facilities up to an additional $1 billion, upon the agreement of either existing lenders or of additional banks not currently parties to the existing credit agreements.

In November 2011, the company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement, the company may issue debt securities, depending on market conditions.

The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its revolving credit facilities and debt securities.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the company’s obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations as of

July 28, 2013

. For additional information on debt, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. These commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other long-term liabilities primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations. For additional information on other long-term liabilities, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

_______________________________________

Excludes unamortized net discount/premium on debt issuances and amounts related to interest rate swaps designated as fair-value hedges. For additional information on debt obligations, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

Interest payments for short-term borrowings are calculated based on par values and rates of contractually obligated issuances at fiscal year end. Interest payments on long-term debt are based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at fiscal year end.

(3)

Represents payments of cross-currency swaps, forward exchange contracts, commodity contracts, and deferred compensation hedges. Contractual payments for cross-currency swaps represent future discounted cash payments based on forward interest and spot foreign exchange rates.

(4)

Includes purchase commitments of $44 million and operating leases of $27 million related to discontinued operations.

(5)

Represents other long-term liabilities, excluding unrecognized tax benefits, postretirement benefits and payments related to pension plans. For additional information on pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments

The company guarantees approximately

2,000

bank loans to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third-party financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments the company could be required to make under the guarantees is

$165 million

. The company’s guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution


routes. The company does not believe that it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. See also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off-balance sheet arrangements.

INFLATION

In fiscal 2013, inflation in cost of goods sold was lower than fiscal 2012 and 2011.  The company continues to use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices, commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies and capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations.

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY

The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations, which accounted for 23% of


net sales from continuing operations, are concentrated principally in Australia and Canada. The company manages its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross-currency swaps and forward contracts. Cross-currency swaps and forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, soybean oil, wheat, aluminum, natural gas, cocoa and corn, which impact the cost of raw materials.

The information below summarizes the company’s market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of

July 28, 2013

. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 13 through 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The company’s utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and the company’s acquisition and divestiture activities.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions:

Trade and consumer promotion programs —

The company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, and coupons. The mix between promotion programs, which are classified as reductions in revenue, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on the company’s overall marketing plans, and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues. The measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. However, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates.

Valuation of long-lived assets —

Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the


impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the “implied” fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $360 million was recorded on goodwill and $36 million on trademarks for the simple meals business in Europe.  The impairment was attributable to a combination of factors, including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business; a revised future outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows, given the economic uncertainty in the region; future investments required to maintain performance; and management's assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital.

On August 12, 2013, the company announced that it was in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of this  business. The company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The assets and liabilities have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 28, 2013.

As of

July 28, 2013

, the carrying value of goodwill was $2.407 billion, of which $110 million relates to the European simple meals business and has been included in assets held for sale. Prior to the impairment charge in 2013, the company had not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing, which began in 2003. As of the


measurement, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit  of continuing operations exceeded the carrying value by at least 40%, excluding  the 2013 acquisitions.  Holding all other assumptions used in the


fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value. As of July 28, 2013, goodwill related to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and Plum was $692 million and $128 million, respectively.  Within Bolthouse, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by at least 15%. Because the Plum acquisition closed on June 13, 2013, the carrying value represents fair value.

As of

July 28, 2013

, the carrying value of trademarks was $960 million, of which $150 million relates to the European simple meals business and has been included in assets held for sale. Holding all other assumptions used in the


measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of  trademarks of continuing operations, excluding the 2013 acquisitions, but would not result in an impairment charge. As of July 28, 2013, trademarks related to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and Plum were $383 million and $115 million, respectively.

In 2012, as part of the company’s annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of

$3 million

was recognized related to a trademark used in the European simple meals business, formerly included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year.

The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the company’s control, such as capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.

See also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.

Pension and postretirement benefits —

The company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods.

The discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the company’s current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method.  Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are


determined at each measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year.

Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was $130 million in 2013, $102 million in 2012, and $98 million in 2011.

Significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows:

Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $14 million; a 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $12 million. A one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $1 million.

Net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to decrease to approximately $90 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased amortization of unrecognized losses as a result of an increase in the discount rate.

The company contributed

$75 million

,

$55 million

, and

$100 million

, respectively, to U.S. pension plans in 2013, 2012, and 2011. Contributions to non-U.S. plans were

$12 million

in 2013,

$16 million

in 2012, and

$44 million

in 2011. The company contributed $35 million to U.S. plans in the first quarter of 2014. Additional contributions to U.S. plans are not expected in 2014. Contributions to non-U.S. plans are expected to be approximately

$18 million

in 2014.

See also Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expenses.

Income taxes —

The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

See also Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Campbell Soup Company, together with its subsidiaries (the company), is a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products.

Basis of Presentation

— The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and entities in which the company maintains a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior-year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. The company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest July 31. There were


weeks in 2013, 2012, and 2011. There will be


weeks in 2014.

On August 12, 2013, the company announced that it is in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of its simple meals business in Europe. The European business includes

Erasco

and

Heisse Tasse

soups in Germany;

Liebig

and

Royco

soups in France;

Devos Lemmens

mayonnaise and cold sauces and

Royco

soups in Belgium; and

Blå Band

and

Isomitta

soups and sauces in Sweden.  The company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The assets and liabilities of the European business have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

July 28, 2013

.  See Note 4 for additional information.

Use of Estimates

— Generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

— Revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete. This occurs when products are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to customers, collection is probable and pricing is fixed or determinable. Revenues are recognized net of provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Certain sales promotion expenses, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupon redemption costs, are classified as a reduction of sales. The recognition of costs for promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Costs are recognized either upon sale or when the incentive is offered, based on the program. Revenues are presented on a net basis for arrangements under which suppliers perform certain additional services.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.

Inventories

— All inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost and are depreciated over estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings and machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods not exceeding

45 years

and

20 years

, respectively. Assets are evaluated for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions include significant adverse changes in business climate or a plan of disposal. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

— Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the “implied” fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value.

See Note 6 for information on intangible assets and an impairment charge recognized in 2013.


Derivative Financial Instruments

— The company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodities and equity-linked employee benefit obligations. These derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The company's derivative programs include strategies that qualify and strategies that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated.

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, on the date the derivative contract is entered into, the company designates the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (fair-value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge), or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Some derivatives may also be considered natural hedging instruments (changes in fair value act as economic offsets to changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item) and are not designated for hedge accounting.

Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlying hedged asset or liability (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in current-period earnings. The effective portion of gains and losses on cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. If the hedge is no longer effective, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are included in earnings each period until the instrument matures. If a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Any ineffective portion of designated hedges is recognized in current-period earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognized in current-period earnings.

Cash flows from derivative contracts are included in Net cash provided by operating activities.

Advertising Production Costs

— Advertising production costs are expensed in the period that the advertisement first takes place or when a decision is made not to use an advertisement.

Research and Development Costs

— The costs of research and development are expensed as incurred. Costs include expenditures for new product and manufacturing process innovation, and improvements to existing products and processes. Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting, and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.

Income Taxes

— Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance requiring entities to present net income and other comprehensive income (OCI) in one continuous statement or two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and comprehensive income. The option to present items of OCI in the statement of changes in equity has been eliminated. In December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to defer a requirement in the June 2011 standard that called for reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to be measured and presented by income statement line item in net income and also in OCI. The  requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and for interim reporting periods within those years. The company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2013. The adoption impacted the presentation of financial statements but did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2013, the FASB finalized the requirements related to reclassification adjustments from AOCI. The new standard requires that companies present either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements, the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of AOCI. If a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety, the guidance requires a cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional information. The company adopted the guidance in the third quarter of 2013. The adoption resulted in additional disclosures but did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance related to disclosures about offsetting (netting) of assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position. The guidance requires entities to disclose gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions that are offset in the statement of financial position, and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. The scope includes financial instruments and derivative instruments. In January 2013, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance to limit the scope of the new balance sheet offsetting disclosures to derivatives,


repurchase agreements, and securities lending transactions to the extent that they are offset in the financial statements or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar arrangement. The disclosures are required for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Disclosures required under the guidance will be provided for all comparative periods presented. The adoption will impact disclosures but will not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In July 2012, the FASB issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The amendments will allow an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. An entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative test unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendments are effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. The company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of certain obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount is fixed. Such obligations may include debt arrangements, legal settlements, and other contractual arrangements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013 and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for those obligations within scope that existed as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The company is currently evaluating the new guidance.

In March 2013, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity. The guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013. Early adoption is permitted. The company will prospectively apply the guidance to applicable transactions.

In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance which permits an entity to designate the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate, also referred to as the overnight index swap rate, as a benchmark interest rate in a hedge accounting relationship. In addition, the guidance removes the restriction on using different benchmark interest rates for similar hedges. The guidance was effective in July 2013. The company will prospectively apply the guidance to applicable transactions.

In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The guidance requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of uncertain tax positions.  Under the new standard, UTBs will be netted against all available same-jurisdiction loss or other tax carryforwards that would be utilized, rather than only against carryforwards that are created by the UTBs. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, and should be applied prospectively to all UTBs that exist at the effective date. Retrospective application is permitted. The company is currently evaluating the new guidance.

Acquisitions

On August 6, 2012, the company completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms from a fund managed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity firm, for

$1,550

in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. On August 6, 2012, the preliminary purchase price adjustments resulted in an increase in the purchase price of

$20

. In the third quarter, the purchase price adjustments were finalized and reduced to

$11

. The company funded the acquisition through a combination of short- and long-term borrowings. Bolthouse Farms is a vertically integrated food and beverage company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing fresh carrots and proprietary, high value-added healthy products.

The company incurred transaction costs of

$10

(

$7

after tax) in the first quarter of


and

$5

(

$3

after tax) during the fourth quarter of


. The costs were recorded in Other expenses/(income).

The acquisition of Bolthouse Farms contributed

$756

to Net sales and resulted in an increase of

$18

to Net earnings from August 6, 2012 through

July 28, 2013

. Net earnings reflect the transaction costs incurred in 2013, additional interest expense on the debt issued to finance the purchase, amortization and depreciation expense based on the estimated fair value and useful lives of intangible assets, plant assets, and related tax effects.

The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable assets was recorded as

$692

of goodwill. Of this amount,

$284

is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill was primarily attributable to future growth opportunities and any intangible assets that did not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is included in the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment.

On June 13, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Plum for

$249

, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Plum is a leading provider of premium, organic foods and snacks that serve the nutritional needs of babies, toddlers and children. The acquisition provides the company with an attractive platform to extend its core categories of simple meals, snacks and beverages and enhances the company's access to a new generation of consumers.


The acquisition of Plum contributed

$14

to Net sales and resulted in a decrease of

$2

to Net earnings from June 14, 2013 through

July 28, 2013

.

The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable assets was recorded as

$128

of goodwill. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill was primarily attributable to future growth opportunities and any intangible assets that did not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is included in the U.S. Simple Meals segment. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and is subject to the finalization of appraisals, which will be completed in 2014.

The acquired assets and assumed liabilities for both acquisitions include the following:

The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is as follows:

The identifiable intangible assets of Plum consist of

$115

in non-amortizable trademarks and

$18

in customer relationships to be amortized over


years.

The following unaudited summary information is presented on a consolidated pro forma basis as if both of the acquisitions had occurred on August 1, 2011.

The pro forma amounts include transaction costs, additional interest expense on the debt issued to finance the purchases, amortization and depreciation expense based on the estimated fair value and useful lives of intangible assets, plant assets, and


related tax effects. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the combined results had the acquisitions been completed at August 1, 2011, nor are they indicative of future combined results.

On August 8, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Kelsen. See also Note 21 for additional information.

Discontinued Operations

After receiving an unsolicited offer for its European simple meals business, the company re-evaluated the recent trends, the strategic priority and the long-term financial outlook for that business. The company then pursued discussions that led to finalizing the terms of a potential sale of the business to a third party in the fourth quarter

.

On August 12, 2013, the company announced that it is in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of its simple meals business in Europe. The European business includes

Erasco

and

Heisse Tasse

soups in Germany;

Liebig

and

Royco

soups in France;

Devos Lemmens

mayonnaise and cold sauces and

Royco

soups in Belgium; and

Blå Band

and

Isomitta

soups and sauces in Sweden.

The company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.

Results of discontinued operations were as follows:

In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company recorded an impairment charge on the intangible assets of this business of

$396

(

$263

after tax or

$.83

per share).

In addition, the company recorded

$18

in tax expense (

$.06

per share) representing taxes on the difference between the book value and tax basis of the business. See Note 6 for additional information on the impairment charge.

The assets and liabilities of the European business have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

July 28, 2013

, and are comprised of the following:

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill

The following table shows the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by business segment:

In 2013, the company acquired Bolthouse Farms for

$1,561

and Plum for

$249

. As of July 28, 2013, goodwill related to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and Plum was

$692

and

$128

, respectively. See Note 3.

On August 12, 2013, the company announced that it was in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of its simple meals business in Europe. The assets and liabilities of the European business have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

July 28, 2013

. The company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of

$360

was recorded on goodwill for the simple meals business in Europe to reduce the carrying value to the implied fair value of

$110

. The impairment was attributable to a combination of factors, including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business; a revised future outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows, given the economic uncertainty in the region; future investments required to maintain performance; and management's assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital. Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions.

Intangible Assets

The following table sets forth balance sheet information for intangible assets, excluding goodwill, subject to amortization and intangible assets not subject to amortization:

Non-amortizable intangible assets consist of trademarks, which include

Bolthouse Farms, Pace

, and

Plum Organics.

Trademarks of

$150

used in the European simple meals business have been included in assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

July 28, 2013

. Other amortizable intangible assets consist of recipes, patents and distributor relationships.


Amortization of intangible assets of continuing operations was

$14

for 2013, and

$1

for  2012 and 2011. Amortization expense for the following 5 years is estimated to be

$15

in each of the fiscal periods in 2014 through 2017 and

$11

in 2018. Asset useful lives range from


to


years.

In


, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of

$36

was recognized related to certain trademarks of the European business held for sale, including

Royco

,

Isomitta

and

Heisse Tasse

. The trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows as previously discussed. In


and


, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of

$3

was recognized related to trademarks of the European simple meals business. The trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows. The impairment charges were recorded in earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The discounted estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the company’s control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.

Business and Geographic Segment Information

The company manages operations through


operating segments based on product type and geographic location and has aggregated the operating segments into the appropriate reportable segment based on similar economic characteristics; products; production processes; types or classes of customers; distribution methods; and regulatory environment. The reportable segments are discussed in greater detail below.

The U.S. Simple Meals segment aggregates the following operating segments: U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. The U.S. Soup retail business includes the following products:

Campbell’s

condensed and ready-to-serve soups; and

Swanson

broth and stocks. The U.S. Sauces retail business includes the following products:

Prego

pasta sauces;

Pace

Mexican sauces;

Campbell’s

canned gravies, pasta and beans;

Swanson

canned poultry; and as of June 2013,

Plum Organics

food and snacks.

The Global Baking and Snacking segment aggregates the following operating segments:

Pepperidge Farm

cookies, crackers, bakery and frozen products in U.S. retail; and

Arnott’s

biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific.

The International Simple Meals and Beverages segment aggregates operating segments outside of the U.S., including the retail business in Canada and the businesses in Asia Pacific, Latin America and China.  See also Note 4 for information on the potential sale of the simple meals business in Europe. This business was historically included in this segment. The results of operations of this business have been reflected as discontinued operations for the years presented. Prior periods were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

The U.S. Beverages segment represents the U.S. retail beverages business, including the following products:

V8

juices and beverages; and

Campbell’s

tomato juice.

Bolthouse and Foodservice comprises the Bolthouse Farms carrot products operating segment, including fresh carrots, juice concentrate and fiber; the Bolthouse Farms super-premium refrigerated beverages and refrigerated salad dressings operating segment; and the North America Foodservice operating segment. The North America Foodservice operating segment represents the distribution of products such as soup, specialty entrées, beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm products through various food service channels in the U.S. and Canada. None of these operating segments meets the criteria for aggregation nor the thresholds for separate disclosure. As previously discussed, Bolthouse Farms was acquired in August 2012.

The company evaluates segment performance before interest, taxes and costs associated with restructuring activities. Unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedging activities are excluded from segment operating earnings and are recorded in Corporate expenses as these open positions represent hedges of future purchases. Upon closing of the contracts, the realized gain or loss is transferred to segment operating earnings, which allows the segments to reflect the economic effects of the hedge without exposure to quarterly volatility of unrealized gains and losses. Certain manufacturing, warehousing and distribution activities of the segments are integrated in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, asset information by segment is not discretely maintained for internal reporting or used in evaluating performance. Therefore, only geographic segment asset information is included in the disclosure.

The company's largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately

19%

of consolidated net sales in 2013 and 2012 and

18%

in 2011. All of the company's segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates.

Restructuring Charges

2013 Initiatives

In 2013, the company implemented the following initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency, expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and reduce costs:

•

The company implemented initiatives to improve its U.S. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across its U.S. thermal plant network, including closing its thermal plant in Sacramento, California, which produced soups, sauces and beverages. The closure resulted in the elimination of approximately


full-time positions and was completed in phases. Most of the positions were eliminated in 2013 and operations ceased in August 2013. The company shifted the majority of Sacramento's soup, sauce and beverage production to its thermal plants in Maxton, North Carolina; Napoleon, Ohio; and Paris, Texas. The company also closed its spice plant in South Plainfield, New Jersey, which resulted in the elimination of


positions. The company consolidated spice production at its Milwaukee, Wisconsin, plant in 2013.

•

In Mexico, the company entered into commercial arrangements with third-party providers to expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities. The third-party providers will produce and distribute the company's beverages, soups, broths and sauces throughout the Mexican market. As a result of these agreements, the company will close its plant in Villagrán, Mexico, in 2014 and eliminate approximately


positions.

•

The company will improve its Pepperidge Farm bakery supply chain cost structure by closing its plant in Aiken, South Carolina in 2014.  The company will shift the majority of Aiken's bread production to its bakery plant in Lakeland, Florida.  Approximately


positions will be eliminated as a result of the plant closure.


•

The company streamlined its salaried workforce in U.S. Simple Meals, North America Foodservice and U.S. Beverages by approximately


positions. This action was substantially completed in August 2013.

In 2013, the company recorded a restructuring charge of

$51

related to these initiatives. In addition, approximately

$91

of costs related to these initiatives were recorded in Cost of products sold, representing accelerated depreciation and other exit costs. The aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and related costs was

The company also announced its  exit from the Russian market. Details of the initiatives include:

•

In Australia, the company is investing in a new system to automate packing operations at its biscuit plant in Virginia. This investment continued through the fourth quarter of 2013 and will result in the elimination of approximately


positions. The initiative is now expected to be substantially completed by December 2013. Further, the company improved asset utilization in the U.S. by shifting production of ready-to-serve soups from Paris, Texas, to other facilities in 2012.


In addition, the manufacturing facility in Marshall, Michigan, was closed in 2011, and manufacturing of

Campbell’s Soup at Hand

microwavable products was consolidated at the Maxton, North Carolina, plant in 2012.

Earnings per Share

The accounting guidance for earnings per share provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Awards issued by the company prior to 2011 contained non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.

The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareowners is as follows:

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Pension Benefits —

The company sponsors a number of noncontributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to all eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The benefits provided under these plans are based primarily on years of service and compensation levels. In 1999, the company implemented significant amendments to certain U.S. pension plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are determined based on percentages of annual pay and age. To minimize the impact of converting to the new formula, service and earnings credit continues to accrue through the year 2014 for active employees participating in the plans under the old formula prior to the amendments. Employees will receive the benefit from either the new or old formula, whichever is higher. Benefits become vested upon the completion of three years of service. Benefits are paid from funds previously provided to trustees and insurance companies or are paid directly by the company from general funds. Effective as of January 1, 2011, the company’s U.S. pension plans were amended so that employees hired or rehired on or after that date and who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements will not be eligible to participate in the plans.

Postretirement Benefits —

The company provides postretirement benefits including health care and life insurance to substantially all retired U.S. employees and their dependents. The company established retiree medical account benefits for eligible U.S. retirees. The accounts were intended to provide reimbursement for eligible health care expenses on a tax-favored basis. Effective as of January 1, 2011, the retirement medical program was amended to eliminate the retiree medical account benefit for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. To preserve the benefit for employees close to retirement age, the retiree medical account will be available to employees who were at least age 50 with at least 10 years of service as of December 31, 2010, and who satisfy the other eligibility requirements for the retiree medical program.

The company uses the fiscal year end as the measurement date for the benefit plans.

Components of benefit expense were as follows:

The curtailment loss of

$3

related to the planned closure of the plant in Mexico and was included in the Restructuring charges.  See also Note 8. In 2013 and 2012, net periodic benefit expense of

$1

related to the simple meals business in Europe and is included in Earnings from discontinued operations.

The estimated prior service credit and net actuarial losses that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into periodic pension cost during 2014 are

$1

and

$77

, respectively.

The estimated prior service credit and net actuarial loss that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic postretirement expense during 2014 are

$1

and

$13

, respectively.


Change in benefit obligation:

Change in the fair value of pension plan assets:

Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

The changes in other comprehensive loss associated with pension benefits included the reclassification of actuarial losses into earnings of

$109

and

$74

in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The remaining changes in other comprehensive loss associated with pension benefits were primarily due to net actuarial gains arising during the periods and the impact of foreign currency in 2013 and actuarial losses arising during the period and the impact of foreign currency in 2012.

The change in other comprehensive loss associated with postretirement benefits was due to the reclassification of actuarial losses into earnings of

$15

and

$9

in 2013 and 2012. The remaining changes in other comprehensive loss associated with postretirement benefits were primarily due to net actuarial gains arising during the period in 2013 and net actuarial losses arising during the period in 2012.

The balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss included

$2

in 2013 and

$3

in 2012 related to the simple meals business in Europe.


The following table provides information for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:

The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans was

$2,423

at July 28, 2013 and

$2,657

at July 29, 2012.

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at the end of the year:

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended:

The discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the company’s current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management.

The discount rate used to determine net periodic postretirement expense was

3.75%

in 2013,

5.00%

in 2012, and

5.25%

in 2011.

Assumed health care cost trend rates at the end of the year:

A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care costs would have the following effects on 2013 reported amounts:

Pension Plan Assets

The fundamental goal underlying the investment policy is to ensure that the assets of the plans are invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the plans as these obligations come due. The primary investment objectives include providing a total return which will promote the goal of benefit security by attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan obligations, to provide for real asset growth while also tracking plan obligations, to diversify investments across and within asset classes, to reduce the impact of losses in single investments, and to follow investment practices that comply with applicable laws and regulations.

The primary policy objectives will be met by investing assets to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between return and risk relative to plan obligations. This includes investing a portion of the assets in funds selected in part to hedge the interest rate sensitivity to plan obligations.


The portfolio includes investments in the following asset classes: fixed income, equity, real estate and alternatives. Fixed income will provide a moderate expected return and partially hedge the exposure to interest rate risk of the plans’ obligations. Equities are used for their high expected return. Additional asset classes are used to provide diversification.

Asset allocation is monitored on an ongoing basis relative to the established asset class targets. The interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied to assist in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets. The investment policy permits variances from the targets within certain parameters. Asset rebalancing occurs when the underlying asset class allocations move outside these parameters, at which time the asset allocation is rebalanced back to the policy target weight.

The company’s year-end pension plan weighted-average asset allocations by category were:

Pension plan assets are categorized based on the following fair value hierarchy:

•

Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs, which are valued based on the company's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.


The following table presents the company’s pension plan assets by asset category at July 28, 2013 and July 29, 2012:

Short-term investments —

Investments include cash and cash equivalents, and various short-term debt instruments and short-term investment funds. Institutional short-term investment vehicles valued daily are classified as Level 1 at cost which approximates market value. Other investment vehicles are valued based upon a net asset value and are classified as Level 2.

Equities —

Common stocks and preferred stocks are classified as Level 1 and are valued using quoted market prices in active markets.

Corporate bonds —

These investments are valued based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models using current market rates.

Government and agency bonds —

These investments are generally valued based on bid quotations and recent trade data for identical or similar obligations.

Municipal bonds —

These investments are valued based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models using current market rates.

Commingled funds —

Investments in commingled funds are classified as Level 2 assets as the funds are not traded in active markets. Commingled funds are valued based on the unit values of such funds. Unit values are based on the fair value of the underlying assets of the funds derived from inputs principally based on quoted market prices in an active market or corroborated


by observable market data by correlation or other means. Blended commingled funds are invested in both equities and fixed income securities.

Mortgage and asset backed securities —

Fair value is based on prices obtained from third party pricing sources. The prices from third party pricing sources may be based on bid quotes from dealers and recent trade data. Mortgage backed securities are traded in the over-the-counter market.

Real estate —

Real estate investments consist of real estate investment trusts and property funds. Real estate investment trusts are classified as Level 1 and are valued based on quoted market prices. Property funds are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 depending upon whether liquidity is limited or there are few observable market participant transactions. Fair value is based on third party appraisals.

Limited partnerships —

Investments in limited partnerships are valued based upon valuations provided by the general partners of the funds. The values of limited partnerships are based upon an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sales transactions with third parties, expected cash flows, and market-based information, including comparable transactions and performance multiples among other factors. The investments are classified as Level 3 since the valuation is determined using unobservable inputs.

Hedge funds —

Hedge fund investments include hedge funds valued based upon a net asset value derived from the fair value of underlying securities and are therefore classified as Level 2 assets. Hedge fund investments that are subject to liquidity restrictions or that are based on unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3 assets. Hedge fund investments may include long and short positions in equity and fixed income securities, derivative instruments such as futures and options, commodities, and other types of securities.

Other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets included net accrued interest and dividends receivable, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased, and other payables.

The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of Level 3 investments for the years ended July 28, 2013 and July 29, 2012:

A contribution of

$35

was made to U.S. pension plans in the first quarter of 2014. Additional contributions to U.S. plans are not expected in 2014. Contributions to non-U.S. pension plans are expected to be approximately

$18

in 2014.


Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:

The estimated future benefit payments include payments from funded and unfunded plans.

Savings Plan —

The company sponsors employee savings plans which cover substantially all U.S. employees. Effective January 1, 2011, the company provides a matching contribution of

100%

of employee contributions up to

4%

of compensation for employees who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2011 who will not be eligible to participate in the defined benefit plans and who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements receive a contribution equal to

3%

of compensation regardless of their participation in the Savings Plan. Prior to January 1, 2011, the company provided a matching contribution of

60%

(

50%

at certain locations) of the employee contributions up to

5%

of compensation after one year of continued service. Amounts charged to Costs and expenses were

$27

in 2013,

$24

in 2012, and

$20

in 2011.

12.

Taxes on Earnings

The provision for income taxes on earnings from continuing operations consists of the following:


The following is a reconciliation of the effective income tax rate on continuing operations to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate:

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following:

At July 28, 2013, U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately

$423

. Of these carryforwards,

$183

expire between


and


, and

$240

may be carried forward indefinitely. The current statutory tax rates in these countries range from

15%

to

35%

. At July 28, 2013, deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established to offset

$145

of these tax loss carryforwards. Additionally, at July 28, 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company had capital loss carryforwards of approximately

$342

, which were fully offset by valuation allowances. U.S. subsidiaries of the company had a capital loss carryforward of

$1

which expires in


for which no valuation allowance had been established.

The net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2013 was an increase of

$6

. The increase was primarily due to the impact of currency and recognition of additional valuation allowances on foreign loss carryforwards. The net change in the valuation allowance in 2012 was a decrease of

$14

. The decrease was primarily due to the discontinuation of the company's Russian operations as well as the impact of currency and the recognition of additional valuation allowances on foreign loss carryforwards.

As of July 28, 2013, other deferred tax assets included

$7

of foreign tax credit carryforwards that expire in


, and

$10

of state tax credit carryforwards related to various states that expire between


and


. As of July 28, 2012, other deferred tax assets included

$3

of foreign tax credit carryforwards that expire in


, and

$3

of state tax credit carryforwards that expire between


and


and are related to various states. No valuation allowances have been established related to these deferred tax assets.

As of July 28, 2013, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on approximately

$714

of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are deemed to be permanently reinvested. It is not practical to estimate the tax liability that might be incurred if such earnings were remitted to the U.S.


A reconciliation of the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits follows:

The increase in 2013 for prior-year tax positions was primarily due to the acquisitions of Bolthouse Farms and Plum.

As of July 28, 2013, July 29, 2012, and July 31, 2011, there were

$23

,

$18

, and

$16

, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the annual effective tax rate. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements, tax examination activities, statute expirations and the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The company is unable to estimate what this change could be within the next 12 months, but does not believe it would be material to the financial statements. As of July 29, 2012, there was approximately

$6

of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, including interest and penalties, reported as accrued taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Approximately

$2

of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, were reported as accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 28, 2013.

The company’s accounting policy with respect to interest and penalties attributable to income taxes is to reflect any expense or benefit as a component of its income tax provision. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings was not material in 2013, 2012 and 2011. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was

$2

as of July 28, 2013, and

$8

as of July 29, 2012.

The company does business internationally and, as a result, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as the U.S., Australia, Canada, Belgium, France and Germany. The 2013 tax year is currently under audit by the IRS. In addition, several state income tax examinations are in progress for fiscal years 2006 to 2012.

With limited exceptions, the company has been audited for income tax purposes in Germany through fiscal year 2007, and in Canada, France, Belgium and Australia through fiscal year 2009.

On August 6, 2012, the company completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms from a fund managed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity firm, for

$1,550

in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. On August 6, 2012, the preliminary purchase price adjustments resulted in an increase in the purchase price of

$20

. In the third quarter, the purchase price adjustments were finalized and reduced to

$11

Financial Instruments

The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. In order to manage these exposures, the company follows established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps, options, forwards and commodity futures. These derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.


The company’s derivative programs include instruments that qualify and instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations.  To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the company only enters into contracts with carefully selected, leading, credit-worthy financial institutions, and distributes contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk. The company does not have credit-risk-related contingent features in its derivative instruments as of

July 28, 2013

. During 2013, the company's largest customer accounted for approximately

19%

of consolidated net sales. The company closely monitors credit risk associated with counterparties and customers.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its international operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries. The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries. Principal currencies hedged include the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Swedish krona, New Zealand dollar, British pound and Japanese yen. The company utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts as well as cross-currency swaps to hedge these exposures. The contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. The company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency transaction exposure with foreign exchange forward contracts for periods typically up to


months. To hedge currency exposures related to intercompany debt, foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts as well as cross-currency swap contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt. As of

July 28, 2013

, cross-currency swap contracts mature between


and

36 months

. The notional amount of foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges was

$129

at

July 28, 2013

and

$156

at

July 29, 2012

. The effective portion of the changes in fair value on these instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings on the same line item and the same period in which the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. The notional amount of foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was

$895

and

$908

at

July 28, 2013

and

July 29, 2012

, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk

The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. Receive fixed rate/pay variable rate interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair-value hedges. The notional amount of outstanding fair-value interest rate swaps totaled

$200

at

July 28, 2013

and

$500

at

July 29, 2012

. These swaps mature in

3 months

. The company manages its exposure to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances by entering into forward starting interest rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuances. Pay fixed rate/receive variable rate forward starting interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash-flow hedges. The notional amount of outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps totaled

$250

at

July 28, 2013

and

$600

at

July 29, 2012

. Forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of

$400

were settled in August 2012, at a loss of

$2

, which was recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The loss on the forward starting interest rate swaps will be amortized over the life of the 10-year debt issued in August 2012.

Commodity Price Risk

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, soybean oil, wheat, aluminum, natural gas, cocoa and corn which impact the cost of raw materials. Commodity futures, options, and swap contracts are either accounted for as cash-flow hedges or are not designated as accounting hedges. The company hedges a portion of commodity requirements for periods typically up to


months. There were no commodity contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges as of

July 28, 2013

or

July 29, 2012

. The notional amount of commodity contracts not designated as accounting hedges was

$105

at

July 28, 2013

and

$95

at

July 29, 2012

.

Equity Price Risk

The company enters into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of the company’s capital stock, the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index, and the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. Under these contracts, the company pays variable interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the total return on company capital stock; the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index; or the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. These contracts were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are entered into for periods typically not exceeding


months. The notional amounts of the contracts as of

July 28, 2013

and

July 29, 2012

were

$50

and

$75

, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements

Financial assets and liabilities are categorized based on the following fair value hierarchy:

•

Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs, which are valued based on the company's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. When available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices to measure the fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, the company


bases fair value upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Included in the fair value of derivative instruments is an adjustment for credit and nonperformance risk.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The following table presents the company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of

July 28, 2013

, and

July 29, 2012

, consistent with the fair value hierarchy:

___________________________________

(1)

Based on LIBOR swap rates.

(2)

Based on observable market transactions of spot currency rates and forward rates.

(3)

Based on observable local benchmarks for currency and interest rates.

(4)

Based on quoted futures exchanges and on observable prices of futures and options transactions in the marketplace.

(5)

Based on LIBOR and equity index swap rates.

(6)

Based on the fair value of the participants’ investments.


Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

In addition to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the company is also required to measure certain items at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

On August 12, 2013, the company announced that it was in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of its simple meals business in Europe. The assets and liabilities of the European business have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

July 28, 2013

.  The company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of

$360

was recorded on goodwill for the simple meals business in Europe to reduce the carrying value to the implied fair value of

$110

. The impairment was attributable to a combination of factors, including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business; a revised future outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows, given the economic uncertainty in the region; future investments required to maintain performance; and management's assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital. Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses, which are unobservable Level 3 inputs, and taking into account the firm offer. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions.

In 2013 and 2012, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, impairment charges of

$36

and

$3

were recognized on trademarks used in the European simple meals business. See also Note 6. Fair value was determined based on unobservable Level 3 inputs. Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flow analysis that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital, and assumed royalty rates.

The following table presents the company’s fair value measurements of intangible assets that were recognized in the years ended

July 28, 2013

, and

July 29, 2012

, respectively:

The company also recognized

$99

of accelerated depreciation/asset impairment on plant assets in 2013 associated with the restructuring initiatives described in Note 8. The carrying value of assets was reduced to estimated fair value based on expected proceeds.  The carrying value was $29 at

July 28, 2013

.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings, excluding the current portion of long-term debt, approximate fair value.

Cash equivalents of

$4

at

July 28, 2013

and

$80

at

July 29, 2012

represent fair value as these highly liquid investments have an original maturity of three months or less. Fair value of cash equivalents is based on Level 2 inputs.

The fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt in Short-term borrowings, was

$3,299

at

July 28, 2013

and

$2,663

at

July 29, 2012

. The carrying value was

$3,244

at

July 28, 2013

and

$2,408

at

July 29, 2012

. The fair value of long-term debt is principally estimated using Level 2 inputs based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates.

Stock-based Compensation

In 2003, shareowners approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of

28 million

shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including performance restricted stock) and performance units. Approximately

3.2 million

shares available under a previous long-term plan were rolled into the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, making the total number of available shares approximately

31.2 million

. In November 2005, shareowners approved the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of an additional

6 million

shares to satisfy the same types of awards.

Awards under the 2003 and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans may be granted to employees and directors. The term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. Options granted under these plans vest cumulatively over a three-year period at a rate of

30%

,

60%

and

100%

, respectively. The option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant.

Pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the company adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareowner return (TSR) performance restricted stock/units, EPS performance restricted stock/units, strategic performance restricted stock/units and time-lapse restricted stock/units. Under the program, awards of TSR performance restricted stock/units will be earned by comparing the company’s total shareowner return during a three-year period to the respective total shareowner returns of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon the company’s ranking in the performance peer group, a recipient of TSR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from

0%

to

225%

of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units will be earned based upon the company’s achievement of annual earnings per share goals. During the three-year vesting period, a recipient of EPS performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from

0%

to

100%

of the initial grant. Awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units are earned based upon the achievement of net sales and EPS growth, compared to strategic plan objectives during a two-year period. A recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units may earn a total award ranging from

0%

to

200%

of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted stock/units will vest ratably over the three-year period. In addition, the company may issue special grants of time-lapse restricted stock/units to attract and retain executives which vest ratably over various periods. Awards are generally granted annually in October. Annual stock option grants were not part of the long-term incentive compensation program for 2011, 2012 or 2013. However, stock options may still be granted on a selective basis under the Long-Term Incentive Plans.

In 2013, the company issued time-lapse restricted stock units, EPS performance restricted stock units, strategic performance restricted stock units and TSR performance restricted stock units.

Total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense recognized in Earnings from continuing operations was

$109

for 2013,

$76

for 2012, and

$84

for 2011.  The pre-tax stock-based compensation expense recognized in Earnings from discontinued operations was

July 28, 2013

:

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2013, 2012, and 2011, was

$36

,

$31

, and

$29

, respectively. As of January 2009, compensation related to stock options was fully expensed. The company measured the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The following table summarizes time-lapse restricted stock units, EPS performance restricted stock units and strategic performance restricted stock units as of

July 28, 2013

:

The fair value of time-lapse restricted stock units, EPS performance restricted stock units, and strategic performance restricted stock units is determined based on the quoted price of the company’s stock at the date of grant. Time-lapse restricted stock units are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants, which are expensed on an accelerated basis. EPS performance restricted stock units are expensed on a graded-vesting basis, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants, which are expensed on an accelerated basis. There were approximately

269 thousand

EPS performance target grants outstanding at

July 28, 2013

with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of

$34.29

. Strategic performance restricted stock units are expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period. Awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units will be earned based upon the achievement of two key metrics, net sales and EPS growth, compared to strategic plan objectives during a two-year period. There were approximately

1.8 million

strategic performance target grants outstanding at

July 28, 2013

with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of

$33.21

. The actual number of EPS performance restricted stock units and strategic performance restricted stock units issued at the vesting date could range from

0%

to

100%

and

0%

to

200%

, respectively, of the initial grant, depending on actual performance achieved. Expense is estimated based on the number of awards expected to vest.

On July 1, 2011, the company issued approximately

400 thousand

special retention time-lapse restricted stock units to certain executives to support successful execution of the company’s shift in strategic direction and leadership transition. These awards vested over a period of

two years

and are included in the table above. The grant-date fair value was

$34.65

.

As of

July 28, 2013

, total remaining unearned compensation related to nonvested time-lapse restricted stock units, EPS performance restricted stock units and strategic performance restricted stock units was

$50

, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of

1.4 years

. The fair value of restricted stock units vested during 2013, 2012, and 2011 was

$57

and

$38

, and

$40

, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units granted during 2012 and 2011 was

$32.38

and

$35.64

, respectively.


The following table summarizes TSR performance restricted stock units as of

July 28, 2013

:

The company estimated the fair value of TSR performance restricted stock units at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. Assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation were as follows:

Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period. As of

July 28, 2013

, total remaining unearned compensation related to TSR performance restricted stock units was

$17

, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of

1.9

years. In the first quarter of


and 2012, recipients of TSR performance restricted stock units earned

0%

of the initial grants based upon the company’s TSR ranking in a performance peer group during a three-year period ended July 27, 2012 and three-year period ended July 29, 2011, respectively. In the first quarter of  2014, recipients of TSR performance restricted stock units will receive

0%

of the initial grants based upon the company’s TSR ranking in a performance peer group during a three-year period ended July 28, 2013. There were no TSR performance restricted stock units granted during

Commitments and Contingencies

The company is a party to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business.

Management assesses the probability of loss for all legal proceedings and claims and has recognized liabilities for such contingencies, as appropriate. Although the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in management’s opinion, the final outcome of legal proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of the company.

The company has certain operating lease commitments, primarily related to warehouse and office facilities, and certain equipment. Rent expense under operating lease commitments was

$54

in 2013,

$48

in 2012, and

$50

in 2011. These amounts included

$8

in 2013 and

$9

in 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to discontinued operations. Future minimum annual rental payments under these operating leases as of July 28, 2013 are as follows:

Future minimum annual rental payments related to discontinued operations include

$8

in 2014;

in 2018; and a total of

$2

for periods beyond 2018.

The company guarantees approximately

2,000

bank loans made to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under the guarantees is

$165

Reports of Management

Management’s Report on Financial Statements

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the company’s management in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles to reflect the financial position of the company and its operating results. The financial information appearing throughout this Report is consistent with the financial statements. Management is responsible for the information and representations in such financial statements, including the estimates and judgments required for their preparation. The financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed entirely of Directors who are not officers or employees of the company, meets regularly with the company’s worldwide internal auditing department, other management personnel, and the independent registered public accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditing department have had, and continue to have, direct access to the Audit Committee without the presence of other management personnel, and have been directed to discuss the results of their audit work and any matters they believe should be brought to the Committee’s attention. The internal auditing department and the independent registered public accounting firm report directly to the Audit Committee.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Directors of the company; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

July 28, 2013

. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on this assessment using those criteria, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

July 28, 2013

.


The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 28, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

July 28, 2013

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Column (a) represents stock options and restricted stock units outstanding under the 2005 Long-Term Plan, the 2003 Long-Term Plan, and the 1994 Long-Term Plan. No additional awards can be made under the 1994 Long-Term Plan. Future equity awards under the 2005 Long-Term Plan and the 2003 Long-Term Plan may take the form of stock options, SARs, performance unit awards, restricted stock, restricted performance stock, restricted stock units or stock awards. Column (b) represents the weighted-average exercise price of the outstanding stock options only; the outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units are not included in this calculation. Column (c) represents the maximum aggregate number of future equity awards that can be made under the 2005 Long-Term Plan and the 2003 Long-Term Plan as of

July 28, 2013

. The maximum number of future equity awards that can be made under the 2005 Long-Term Plan as of

Each restricted stock unit, restricted stock, restricted performance stock unit, restricted performance stock or stock award under the 2003 Long-Term Plan reduces the 2003 Plan Limit by four shares. In the event any award (or portion thereof) under the 1994 Long-Term Plan lapses, expires or is otherwise terminated without the issuance of any company stock or is settled by delivery of consideration other than company stock, the maximum number of future equity awards that can be made under the 2003 Long-Term Plan automatically increases by the number of such shares.
