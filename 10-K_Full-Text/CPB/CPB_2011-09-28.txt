Business

The
    Company

Campbell Soup Company, together with its consolidated
    subsidiaries (Campbell or the company), is a global manufacturer
    and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products.
    Campbell was incorporated as a business corporation under the
    laws of New Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through
    predecessor organizations, it traces its heritage in the food
    business back to 1869. The company’s principal executive
    offices are in Camden, New Jersey

08103-1799.

Reportable
    Segments

Commencing with the 2011 Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

the company reports the results of operations in the following
    reportable segments: U.S. Simple Meals;
    U.S. Beverages; Global Baking and Snacking; International
    Simple Meals and Beverages; and North America Foodservice.
    Segment results of prior periods were modified to conform to the
    current presentation. The company has ten operating segments
    based on product type and geographic location and has aggregated
    the operating segments into the appropriate reportable segment
    based on similar economic characteristics; products; production
    processes; types or classes of customers; distribution methods;
    and regulatory environment. See also Note 6 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The segments are discussed in
    greater detail below.

U.S.
    Simple Meals

The U.S. Simple Meals segment aggregates the following
    operating segments: U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. The
    U.S. Soup retail business includes the following products:

Campbell’s

condensed and

ready-to-serve

soups; and

Swanson

broth and stocks. The U.S. Sauces
    retail business includes the following products:

Prego

pasta sauce;

Pace

Mexican sauce;

Swanson

canned poultry; and

Campbell’s

canned gravies,
    pasta, and beans.

U.S.
    Beverages

The U.S. Beverages segment represents the U.S. retail
    beverages business, including the following products:

V8

juices and beverages and

Campbell’s

tomato juice.

Global
    Baking and Snacking

The Global Baking and Snacking segment aggregates the following
    operating segments:

Pepperidge Farm

cookies, crackers,
    bakery and frozen products in U.S. retail; and

Arnott’s

biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific.

International
    Simple Meals and Beverages

The International Simple Meals and Beverages segment aggregates
    the simple meals and beverages operating segments outside of the
    United States, including Europe, Latin America, the Asia Pacific
    region and the retail business in Canada. The segment’s
    operations include

Erasco

and

Heisse Tasse

soups
    in Germany,

Liebig

and

Royco

soups in France,

Devos Lemmens

mayonnaise and cold sauces and

Campbell’s

and

Royco

soups in Belgium, and

Blå Band

soups and sauces in Sweden. In Asia
    Pacific, operations include

Campbell’s

soup and
    stock,

Swanson

broths,

V8

beverages and

Prego

pasta sauce. In Canada, operations include

Habitant

and

Campbell’s

soups,

Prego

pasta sauce,

Pace

Mexican sauce,

V8

beverages and certain
    Pepperidge Farm products. The French sauce and mayonnaise
    business, which was marketed under the

Lesieur

brand and
    divested on September 29, 2008, was historically included
    in this segment.

North
    America Foodservice

The North America Foodservice segment represents the
    distribution of products such as soup, specialty entrees,
    beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm
    products through various food service channels in the United
    States and Canada.

Ingredients
    and Packaging

The ingredients and packaging required for the manufacture of
    the company’s food products are purchased from various
    suppliers. These items are subject to fluctuations in price
    attributable to a number of factors, including changes in crop
    size, cattle cycles, product scarcity, demand for raw materials,
    energy costs, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import
    and export requirements and weather conditions (including the
    potential effects of climate change) during the growing and
    harvesting seasons. To help reduce some of this price
    volatility, the company uses a combination of purchase orders,
    short- and long-term contracts and various commodity risk
    management tools for most of its ingredients and packaging.
    Ingredient inventories are at a peak during the late fall and
    decline during the winter and spring. Since many ingredients of
    suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only at
    certain seasons, the company makes commitments for the purchase
    of such ingredients during their respective seasons. At this
    time, the company does not anticipate any material restrictions
    on availability or shortages of ingredients or packaging that
    would have a significant impact on the company’s
    businesses. For information on the impact of inflation on the
    company, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Customers

In most of the company’s markets, sales activities are
    conducted by the company’s own sales force and through
    broker and distributor arrangements. During fiscal 2011, in an
    effort to enhance merchandising effectiveness and coverage, the
    company outsourced a larger portion of its U.S. retail
    merchandising activities to a third party. In the United States,
    Canada and Latin America, the company’s products are
    generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass
    discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience
    stores, drug stores, dollar stores and other retail, commercial
    and non-commercial establishments. In Europe, the company’s
    products are generally resold to consumers in retail food
    chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores,
    convenience stores and other retail, commercial and
    non-commercial establishments. In the Asia Pacific region, the
    company’s products are generally resold to consumers
    through retail food chains, convenience stores and other retail,
    commercial and non-commercial establishments. The company makes
    shipments promptly after receipt and acceptance of orders.

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and
    its affiliates, accounted for approximately 17% of the
    company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2011 and 18%
    during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. All of the company’s
    segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its
    affiliates. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the
    company’s consolidated net sales.

Trademarks
    and Technology

As of September 15, 2011, the company owned over 4,100
    trademark registrations and applications in over
    160 countries and believes that its trademarks are of
    material importance to its business. Although the laws vary by
    jurisdiction, trademarks generally are valid as long as they are
    in use

and/or

their
    registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to
    have become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be
    renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. The
    company believes that its principal brands, including

Campbell’s

,

Erasco

,

Liebig

,

Pepperidge Farm

,

Goldfish

,

V8

,

Pace

,

Prego

,

Swanson

,

Royco

and

Arnott’s,

are protected by trademark law in the major markets where
    they are used. In addition, some of the company’s products
    are sold under brands that have been licensed from third parties.

Although the company owns a number of valuable patents, it does
    not regard any segment of its business as being dependent upon
    any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, the
    company owns copyrights, both registered and unregistered, and
    proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and
    other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Competition

The company experiences worldwide competition in all of its
    principal products. This competition arises from numerous
    competitors of varying sizes, including producers of generic and
    private label products, as well as from manufacturers of other
    branded food products, which compete for trade merchandising
    support and consumer


dollars. As such, the number of competitors cannot be reliably
    estimated. The principal areas of competition are brand
    recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion,
    convenience and service.

Working
    Capital

For information relating to the company’s cash and working
    capital items, see “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Capital
    Expenditures

During fiscal 2011, the company’s aggregate capital
    expenditures were $272 million. The company expects to
    spend approximately $325 million for capital projects in
    fiscal 2012. Major fiscal 2012 capital projects include an
    ongoing initiative to simplify the soup-making process in North
    America (also known as the soup common platform initiative),
    Pepperidge Farm’s new 34,000-square-foot innovation center,
    packing automation and capacity expansion projects at one of the
    company’s Australian biscuit plants, continued enhancement
    of the company’s corporate headquarters in Camden, New
    Jersey, and a warehouse automation project at one of the
    company’s North American plants.

Research
    and Development

During the last three fiscal years, the company’s
    expenditures on research and development activities relating to
    new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing
    products were $129 million in 2011, $123 million in
    2010, and $114 million in 2009. The increase from 2010 to
    2011 was primarily due to costs associated with an ongoing
    initiative to simplify the soup-making process in North America,
    costs associated with product innovation in North America, costs
    associated with a global baked snacks initiative, and the impact
    of currency, partially offset by cost savings initiatives. The
    increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in
    compensation and benefit costs, costs associated with an
    initiative to simplify the soup-making process in North America,
    and the impact of currency. The company conducts this research
    and development primarily at its headquarters in Camden, New
    Jersey, although important research and development is
    undertaken at various other locations inside and outside the
    United States. On July 12, 2011, as part of its effort to
    further increase the rate of innovation across its baking and
    snacking portfolio, the company announced plans to invest more
    than $30 million to build a

new 34,000-squre-foot

innovation center at its Pepperidge Farm facility in Norwalk,
    Connecticut. The project will also include extensive upgrades to
    Pepperidge Farm’s existing headquarters at the site.

Environmental
    Matters

The company has requirements for the operation and design of its
    facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules
    and regulations. Of the company’s $272 million in
    capital expenditures made during fiscal 2011, approximately
    $18 million was for compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations in the United States. The company further estimates
    that approximately $20 million of the capital expenditures
    anticipated during fiscal 2012 will be for compliance with
    United States environmental laws and regulations. The company
    believes that continued compliance with existing environmental
    laws and regulations (both within the United States and
    elsewhere) will not have a material effect on capital
    expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the
    company. In addition, the company continues to monitor pending
    environmental laws and regulations within the United States and
    elsewhere, including laws and regulations relating to climate
    change and greenhouse gas emissions. While the impact of these
    pending laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty,
    the company does not believe that compliance with these pending
    laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital
    expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the
    company.

Seasonality

Demand for the company’s products is somewhat seasonal,
    with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the
    highest sales volume due primarily to demand for the
    company’s soup products. Demand for the company’s
    sauce, beverage, baking and snacking products, however, is
    generally evenly distributed throughout the year.


Employees

On July 31, 2011, there were approximately
    17,500 employees of the company.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report,
    the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely
    affect the company’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known to the company or that the company currently
    deems immaterial also may impair the company’s business
    operations and financial condition.

The
    company operates in a highly competitive industry

The company operates in the highly competitive food industry and
    experiences worldwide competition in all of its principal
    products. The principal areas of competition are brand
    recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion,
    convenience and service. A number of the company’s primary
    competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other
    resources. A strong competitive response from one or more of
    these competitors to the company’s marketplace efforts, or
    a consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result
    in the company reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other
    expenditures,

and/or

losing market share.

The
    company faces risks related to recession, financial and credit
    market disruptions and other economic conditions

Customer and consumer demand for the company’s products may
    be impacted by recession or other economic downturns in the
    United States or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in
    financial and credit markets may impact the company’s
    ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its
    customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in any
    one of the following factors in the United States or other
    nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market
    disruptions or other reasons, could impact the company: tax
    rates, interest rates or equity markets.

Increased
    regulation could adversely affect the company’s business or
    financial results

The manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively
    regulated. The primary areas of regulation include the
    processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising,
    labeling, quality and safety of the company’s food
    products, as well as the health and safety of the company’s
    employees and the protection of the environment. In the United
    States, the company is subject to regulation by various
    government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration,
    the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade
    Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
    and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various
    state and local agencies. The company is also regulated by
    similar agencies outside the United States and by voluntary
    organizations, such as the National Advertising Division and the
    Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative of the
    Council of


Better Business Bureaus. Changes in regulatory requirements
    (such as proposed requirements designed to restrict food
    marketing), or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory
    requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital
    expenditures and other financial obligations that could
    adversely affect the company’s business or financial
    results.

Fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the
    company’s results

The company holds assets and incurs liabilities, generates
    revenue, and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than
    the U.S. dollar, primarily the Australian dollar, Canadian
    dollar, and the euro. The company’s consolidated financial
    statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and therefore the
    company must translate its assets, liabilities, sales and
    expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes.
    As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may
    materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the
    company’s consolidated financial statements, even if their
    value has not changed in their original currency.

The
    company’s results may be adversely impacted by increases in
    the price of raw and packaging materials

The raw and packaging materials used in the company’s
    business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry,
    vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these
    materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of
    factors, including product scarcity, demand for raw materials,
    commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency
    fluctuations, weather conditions (including the potential
    effects of climate change), import and export requirements and
    changes in government-sponsored agricultural programs. To the
    extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and
    packaging material prices, the company may not be able to offset
    such increases through productivity or price increases or
    through its commodity hedging activity.

Price
    increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may
    result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in
    the marketplace

The company intends to pass along to customers some or all cost
    increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs
    through increases in the selling prices of some of its products.
    Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume.
    To the extent the price increases are not sufficient to offset
    increased raw and packaging materials and other inputs costs,

and/or

if
    they result in significant decreases in sales volume, the
    company’s business results and financial condition may be
    adversely affected.

The
    company’s results are dependent on successful marketplace
    initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the company’s
    products, including new products or packaging
    introductions

The company’s results are dependent on successful
    marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the
    company’s products. The company’s product
    introductions and product improvements, along with its other
    marketplace initiatives, are designed to capitalize on customer
    or consumer trends. In order to remain successful, the company
    must anticipate and react to these trends and develop new
    products or processes to address them. While the company devotes
    significant resources to meeting this goal, the company may not
    be successful in developing new products or processes, or its
    new products or processes may not be accepted by customers or
    consumers.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and
    costs related to its defined benefit pension plans

The company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans
    for employees in the United States and various

non-U.S. locations.

The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust
    assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of
    securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory
    requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment
    returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the
    funded status of the company’s defined benefit pension
    plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost,
    future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status
    as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in the
    company’s obligations or future funding requirements could
    have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the
    company.


The
    company may be adversely impacted by the increased significance
    of some of its customers

The retail grocery trade continues to consolidate. These
    consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with
    increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek
    lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their
    suppliers. These customers may also in the future use more of
    their shelf space, currently used for the company’s
    products, for their private label products. If the company is
    unable to use its scale, marketing expertise, product innovation
    and category leadership positions to respond to these customer
    initiatives, the company’s business or financial results
    could be negatively impacted. In addition, the disruption of
    sales to any of the company’s large customers for an
    extended period of time could adversely affect the
    company’s business or financial results.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or failure
    of, its information technology systems

Each year the company engages in several billion dollars of
    transactions with its customers and vendors. Because the amount
    of dollars involved is so significant, the company’s
    information technology resources must provide connections among
    its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer
    service, and accounting functions. If the company does not
    allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build
    and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure and to
    maintain the related computerized and manual control processes,
    the company’s business or financial results could be
    negatively impacted. Furthermore, the company’s information
    technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches or
    other system failures. If the company is unable to prevent such
    security breaches or system failures, the company’s
    business or financial results could be negatively impacted.

The
    company may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost
    savings or benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information
    technology or other initiatives

The company’s success is partly dependent upon properly
    executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from,
    its ongoing supply chain, information technology and other
    initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make
    the company more efficient in the manufacture and distribution
    of its products, which is necessary in the company’s highly
    competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a
    failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not
    meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an
    interruption to the company’s sales, manufacturing,
    logistics, customer service or accounting functions.

Disruption
    to the company’s supply chain could adversely affect its
    business

Damage or disruption to the company’s suppliers or to the
    company’s manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to
    weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes,
    or other reasons could impair the company’s ability to
    manufacture

and/or

sell
    its products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the
    likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively
    manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is
    sourced from a single location, could adversely affect the
    company’s business or financial results.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by the failure to execute
    acquisitions and divestitures successfully

From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or
    divestitures. The success of any such acquisition or divestiture
    depends, in part, upon the company’s ability to identify
    suitable buyers or sellers, negotiate favorable contractual
    terms and, in many cases, obtain governmental approval. For
    acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently
    integrating the acquired business into the company’s
    existing operations, successfully managing new risks associated
    with the acquired business and achieving expected returns and
    other benefits. Acquisitions outside the United States may
    present unique challenges or increase the company’s
    exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including
    foreign currency risks and the risks of complying with foreign
    regulations. Finally, for acquisitions, the company may incur
    substantial additional indebtedness, which could adversely
    impact its credit rating. In cases where acquisitions or
    divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, the
    company’s business or financial results could be negatively
    impacted.


The
    company’s results may be impacted negatively by political
    conditions in the nations where the company does
    business

The company is a global manufacturer and marketer of
    high-quality, branded convenience food products. Because of its
    global reach, the company’s performance may be impacted
    negatively by politically motivated factors, such as unfavorable
    changes in tariffs or export and import restrictions, in the
    nations where it does business. The company may also be impacted
    by political instability, civil disobedience, armed hostilities
    and terrorist acts in the nations where it does business.

If the
    company’s food products become adulterated or are
    mislabeled, the company might need to recall those items and may
    experience product liability claims if consumers are
    injured

The company may need to recall some of its products if they
    become adulterated or if they are mislabeled. The company may
    also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes
    injury. A widespread product recall could result in significant
    losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product
    inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product
    for a period of time. The company could also suffer losses from
    a significant product liability judgment against it. A
    significant product recall or product liability case could also
    result in adverse publicity, damage to the company’s
    reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the
    company’s products. In addition, the company’s results
    could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the
    safety and quality of the company’s products, ingredients
    or packaging, even in the absence of a recall or a product
    liability case. Adverse publicity about the company’s
    products, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from
    buying the company’s products.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

Description
    of the Company

Campbell Soup Company is a global manufacturer and marketer of
    high-quality, branded convenience food products. Commencing with
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the company reports the
    results of operations in the following reportable segments:
    U.S. Simple Meals; U.S. Beverages; Global Baking and
    Snacking; International Simple Meals and Beverages; and North
    America Foodservice. Segment results of prior periods were
    modified to conform to the current presentation. See Note 6
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    information on segments.

Key
    Strategies

In fiscal 2011, management and the Board of Directors conducted
    a comprehensive review of the company’s recent performance
    and business strategies. In July 2011, the company announced a
    new strategic framework focused on expansion of its brand and
    product platforms in its three core categories of simple meals,
    healthy beverages and baked snacks. The new framework is
    centered on three growth strategies:

•

Stabilize and then profitably grow the company’s North
    America soup and simple meals business.

•

Expand the company’s international presence.

•

Continue to drive growth in the company’s healthy beverages
    and baked snacks businesses.

The new growth strategies are intended to accelerate profitable
    net sales growth and build the foundation for delivery of
    sustainable above-average total shareholder returns.

Implementation of the company’s new strategic framework
    will require substantial investment in 2012 to extend product
    platforms, re-invigorate consumer-focused marketing to expand
    the equities of its core brands, and drive global expansion. The
    company expects that these investments will negatively affect
    financial performance in 2012, but set the stage for profitable
    growth in 2013 and beyond.


The company is taking a number of steps to stabilize and then
    revitalize its soup and simple meals business in North America.
    In the first half of fiscal 2011, the company increased
    promotional support for its North America soup and simple meals
    business. This increased support did not deliver anticipated
    volume gains. Going forward, marketing investment in soup and
    simple meals will be rebalanced toward a greater emphasis on
    consumer brand building, with the recognition that this shift
    may have a short-term negative impact on volume. While it will
    continue to invest in advertising and innovation focused on
    maintaining the vitality of existing product lines, the company
    will devote a greater proportion of its research and development
    resources than in past years to innovation designed to expand
    its product platforms and packaging formats in the simple meals
    category and to reach new consumers and new usage occasions. In
    the area of health and wellness, the company will emphasize
    consumer choice. It will continue to offer a significant variety
    of products to meet the needs of consumers for whom lower sodium
    is a dietary priority. It will also offer other product
    propositions intended to appeal to consumers with a variety of
    health and wellness concerns.

The company plans to expand its presence in international
    markets by extending its product platforms in its existing
    categories in its current businesses in Europe and Asia Pacific,
    and by pursuing growth opportunities in fast-growing markets in
    Asia and Latin America. The company anticipates that its
    expansion into new markets will be anchored in external
    development, with transactions that may include both
    acquisitions and strategic alliances such as joint ventures and
    other strategic partnerships. In the People’s Republic of
    China, it will continue to focus on building a soup and simple
    meals business through the joint venture with Swire Pacific
    Limited announced in January 2011.

In its healthy beverages business, the company will leverage its
    differentiating capabilities in the area of fruit and vegetable
    nutrition to pursue innovation in fast-growing product segments,
    such as energy drinks and juices, and seek to expand the
    business in geographies outside of the United States. Growth in
    baked snacks will be fueled by continuing innovation in adjacent
    product segments and categories and expanded consumer support.
    On July 12, 2011, the company announced plans to enhance
    its innovation capabilities in baked snacks by building a new
    34,000-square-foot innovation center at the headquarters of its
    Pepperidge Farm business in Norwalk, Connecticut.

Executive
    Summary

This Executive Summary provides significant highlights from the
    discussion and analysis that follows.

•

Net sales increased 1% in 2011 to $7.719 billion.

•

Gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased to 40.2% from
    41.0% a year ago.

•

Net earnings per share were $2.42 in 2011 and 2010. The current
    year included $.12 per share of expense from items that impacted
    comparability. The prior year included $.05 per share of expense
    from items that impacted comparability, as discussed below.

•

For 2011, cash from operations increased from
    $1.057 billion a year ago to $1.142 billion.

Net
    earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company — 2011
    Compared with 2010

The following items impacted the comparability of net earnings
    and net earnings per share:

•

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the company announced a
    series of initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and
    reduce overhead costs across the organization to help fund plans
    to drive the growth of the business. The company also announced
    its intent to exit the Russian market. In the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2011, the company recorded a restructuring charge of
    $63 million ($41 million after tax or $.12 per share)
    related to these initiatives. See Note 7 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and “Restructuring
    Charges” for additional information;

•

In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the company recorded a
    restructuring charge of $12 million ($8 million after
    tax or $.02 per share) for pension benefit costs related to the
    2008 initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term
    profitability. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and “Restructuring Charges” for additional
    information; and


•

In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the company recorded
    deferred tax expense of $10 million, or $.03 per share, to
    reduce deferred tax assets as a result of the U.S. health
    care legislation enacted in March 2010. The law changed the tax
    treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription
    drug benefits to retirees.

Net earnings were $805 million ($2.42 per share) in 2011
    and $844 million ($2.42 per share) in 2010. After adjusting
    for the items impacting comparability, net earnings decreased in
    2011 primarily due to a decline in gross margin percentage and
    lower sales volume, partly offset by lower marketing expenses
    and the impact of currency. After adjusting for items impacting
    comparability, earnings per share increased in 2011 due to a
    reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding,
    primarily due to share repurchases under the company’s
    strategic share repurchase program.

Net
    earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling
    interests

The company owns a 60% controlling interest in a joint venture
    formed with Swire Pacific Limited to support the development of
    the company’s business in China. The joint venture began
    operations on January 31, 2011, the beginning of the third
    fiscal quarter. The noncontrolling interest’s share in the
    net loss was included in Net earnings (loss) attributable to
    noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of
    Earnings.

The company also owns a 70% controlling interest in a Malaysian
    manufacturing company. Historically, the earnings attributable
    to the noncontrolling interest were less than $1 million
    annually and were previously included in Other expenses/(income)
    in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Beginning in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2011, the earnings attributable to the
    noncontrolling interest were included in Net earnings (loss)
    attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings. The earnings were not material in 2011.

Net
    earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company — 2010
    Compared with 2009

Net earnings were $844 million ($2.42 per share) in 2010
    and $736 million ($2.05 per share) in 2009.

In addition to the 2010 items that impacted the comparability of
    net earnings and net earnings per share previously disclosed,
    the following items also impacted comparability:

Continuing
    Operations

•

In fiscal 2009, the company recorded pre-tax
    restructuring-related costs of $22 million
    ($15 million after tax or $.04 per share) in Cost of
    products sold related to the previously announced initiatives to
    improve operational efficiency and long-term profitability. See
    Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and
    “Restructuring Charges” for additional
    information; and

•

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, as part of the
    company’s annual review of intangible assets, an impairment
    charge of $67 million ($47 million after tax or $.13
    per share) was recorded in Other expense/(income) related to
    certain European trademarks, including

Heisse Tasse

,

Blå Band

and

Royco

, used in the International
    Simple Meals and Beverages segment. See Note 5 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.


Discontinued
    Operations

•

In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the company recorded a
    $4 million tax benefit ($.01 per share) related to the sale
    of the Godiva Chocolatier business.

Earnings from continuing operations were $844 million in
    2010 ($2.42 per share) and $732 million ($2.03 per share)
    in 2009. After adjusting for the items impacting comparability,
    Earnings from continuing operations increased primarily due to
    improved gross margin performance and the impact of currency,
    partially offset by lower sales volume. Earnings per share from
    continuing operations benefited from a reduction in the weighted
    average diluted shares outstanding, which was primarily due to
    share repurchases under the company’s strategic share
    repurchase program.

Earnings from discontinued operations of $4 million in 2009
    represented an adjustment to the tax liability associated with
    the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business.

Represents revenue reductions from trade promotion and consumer
    coupon redemption programs.

In 2011, U.S. Simple Meals sales decreased 6%.
    U.S. soup sales decreased 6% reflecting an overall weak
    economy; a challenging competitive environment in the
    U.S. food industry; changes in buying patterns among
    U.S. shoppers, particularly in “stock up”
    purchase behavior; and lower levels of product innovation. In
    this retail environment, the company’s high levels of
    promotional support during the first half of the year did not
    deliver anticipated volume gains.

•

Sales of

Campbell’s

condensed soups declined 4%
    primarily due to declines in eating varieties. Sales of eating
    varieties were negatively impacted by promotional discounting in

ready-to-serve

soups.

•

Sales of

ready-to-serve

soups decreased 9% with declines in both canned and microwavable
    varieties.

•

Broth sales decreased 1%.

Sales of

Prego

pasta sauce and

Pace

Mexican sauce
    declined due to increased competitive activities.

In 2010, U.S. Simple Meals sales decreased 4%.
    U.S. soup sales decreased 4%, due to the following:

•

Sales of

Campbell’s

condensed soups declined 2%, as
    declines in eating varieties were partially offset by gains in
    cooking varieties.

•

Sales of

ready-to-serve

soups decreased 9% with declines in both canned and microwavable
    varieties.

•

Broth sales increased 3% reflecting benefits from growth of
    in-home eating occasions and consumer demand for 100% natural
    product offerings.

Prego

pasta sauce sales increased, reflecting growth of

Prego

Heart Smart varieties, while

Pace

Mexican
    sauce sales declined.


In 2011, U.S. Beverages sales were comparable to 2010 as
    increased volume was offset by higher promotional spending.
    Promotional spending was increased to be more competitive with
    other beverages. Sales of

V8 Splash

juice drinks and

V8 V-Fusion

juice increased, while sales of

V8

vegetable juice declined.

In 2010, U.S. Beverages sales increased 4% primarily due to
    higher sales of

V8 V-Fusion

juice and gains in

V8
    Splash

juice drinks, partly offset by lower sales of

V8

vegetable juice.

V8 V-Fusion

juice sales increased
    double digits due to increased advertising and new item launches.

In 2011, Global Baking and Snacking sales increased 9% as both
    Pepperidge Farm and Arnott’s achieved volume gains and also
    benefited from higher selling prices. Pepperidge Farm sales
    increased primarily due to growth in

Goldfish

snack
    crackers and bakery products, including whole-grain bread. In
    Arnott’s, sales increased primarily due to currency, as
    well as gains in

Shapes

,

Cruskits

, and

Vita-Weat

savory crackers, and chocolate biscuits.

In 2010, Global Baking and Snacking sales increased 7% primarily
    due to currency. Pepperidge Farm sales were comparable to 2009,
    as the additional sales from the acquisition of Ecce Panis, Inc.
    and volume gains were offset by increased promotional spending.
    Arnott’s sales increased due to currency and growth in

Tim Tam

chocolate biscuits and

Shapes

savory
    crackers.

In 2011, International Simple Meals and Beverages sales
    increased 3%, primarily due to currency. In Europe, sales
    declined due to currency. In Asia Pacific, sales increased
    primarily due to currency and volume-driven gains in Australia.
    In Canada, sales increased due to currency and volume gains,
    partially offset by increased promotional spending on soup
    products to be more competitive with other simple meal products.
    Sales in Latin America declined.

In 2010, International Simple Meals and Beverages sales
    increased 5% primarily due to currency, partly offset by the
    divestiture of the company’s French sauce and mayonnaise
    business in September 2008. In Europe, sales declined,
    reflecting lower sales in Germany and the impact of the
    divestiture, partly offset by the impact of currency. In Asia
    Pacific, sales increased due to currency and volume-driven gains
    in Japan, Australia and Malaysia. In Canada, sales increased due
    to currency, partially offset by lower sales volume of

ready-to-serve

soups.

In 2011, North America Foodservice sales increased 2% primarily
    due to gains in refrigerated soup.

In 2010, North America Foodservice sales declined 4% primarily
    due to weakness in the food service sector.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold,
    decreased by $47 million in 2011 from 2010 and increased by
    $122 million in 2010 from 2009. As a percent of sales,
    gross profit was 40.2% in 2011, 41.0% in 2010, and 39.9% in 2009.

The 0.8-percentage-point decrease in gross margin percentage in

Marketing
    and Selling Expenses

Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 13.0%
    in 2011, 13.8% in 2010, and 14.2% in 2009. Marketing and selling
    expenses decreased 5% in 2011 from 2010. The decrease was
    primarily due to lower advertising expenses (approximately
    3 percentage points); lower selling expenses (approximately
    2 percentage points); and lower other marketing expenses
    (approximately 2 percentage points), partly offset by the
    impact of currency (approximately 2 percentage points).
    Marketing and selling expenses decreased 2% in 2010 from 2009.
    The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and consumer
    promotion costs (approximately 3 percentage points) and
    lower marketing expenses (approximately 1 percentage
    point), partially offset by the impact of currency
    (approximately 2 percentage points). The lower advertising
    expenses in 2010 reflected a reduction in media rates and a
    shift to trade promotion in many of the businesses.

Administrative
    Expenses

Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.9% in 2011
    and in 2010, and 7.8% in 2009. Administrative expenses increased
    by 1% in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in pension
    and health care benefit costs (approximately 2 percentage
    points); the impact of currency (approximately 2 percentage
    points); and costs associated with the corporate headquarters
    facility (approximately 1 percentage point), partially
    offset by lower compensation costs (approximately
    2 percentage points) and cost management efforts and other
    factors (approximately 2 percentage points). Administrative
    expenses increased by 2% in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to the
    impact of currency (approximately 2 percentage points); an
    increase in compensation and benefit costs, including pension
    expense (approximately 2 percentage points), partially
    offset by the company’s cost management efforts and other
    factors (approximately 2 percentage points).

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased $6 million or
    5% in 2011 from 2010. The increase was primarily due to costs
    associated with an ongoing initiative to simplify the
    soup-making process and product innovation in North America
    (approximately 2 percentage points); costs associated with
    a global baked snacks initiative (approximately
    2 percentage points), and the impact of currency
    (approximately 2 percentage points), partly offset by costs
    savings initiatives (approximately 1 percentage point).
    Research and development expenses increased $9 million or
    8% in 2010 from 2009. The increase was primarily due to an
    increase in compensation and benefit costs (approximately
    4 percentage points); costs associated with an initiative
    to simplify the soup-making process in North America
    (approximately 2 percentage points); and the impact of
    currency (approximately 2 percentage points).

Other
    Expenses/(Income)

Other expense in 2011 included a $3 million impairment
    charge associated with the

Heisse Tasse

trademark used in
    the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The charge
    was recorded as a result of the company’s annual review of
    intangible assets. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.


Other expense in 2009 included a $67 million impairment
    charge associated with certain European trademarks, including

Heisse Tasse

,

Blå Band

and

Royco

. The
    charge was recorded as a result of the company’s annual
    review of intangible assets and was reflected in the
    International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. See
    Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating
    Earnings

Segment operating earnings decreased 1% in 2011 from 2010 and
    increased 13% in 2010 from 2009. The 2009 results included a

    evaluated excluding restructuring charges. Prior periods were
    modified to conform to the current presentation. See Note 6
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Earnings from U.S. Simple Meals decreased 11% in 2011
    versus 2010. The decline was primarily due to lower sales and a
    reduced gross margin percentage, partially offset by lower
    marketing and selling expenses. In the first half of 2011, in
    response to the overall competitive environment, the company
    maintained higher levels of promotional support, which did not
    deliver anticipated volume gains.

Earnings from U.S. Simple Meals decreased 2% in 2010 versus
    2009. The decrease was due to a decline in U.S. Soup,
    resulting from lower sales, partly offset by lower advertising
    costs. Earnings from U.S. Sauces increased primarily due to
    an improvement in gross margin percentage and lower advertising
    costs, partially offset by lower sales.

Earnings from U.S. Beverages decreased 12% in 2011 versus
    2010 primarily due to increased promotional spending.

Earnings from U.S. Beverages increased 16% in 2010 versus
    2009 primarily due to an improvement in gross margin percentage
    and higher sales.

Earnings from Global Baking and Snacking increased 10% in 2011
    versus 2010. The increase was primarily due to the impact of
    currency and volume-driven growth in both Pepperidge Farm and
    Arnott’s.

Earnings from Global Baking and Snacking increased 22% in 2010
    versus 2009. The increase in operating earnings was due to the
    impact of currency and earnings growth in Pepperidge Farm and
    Arnott’s.


Earnings from International Simple Meals and Beverages increased
    to $185 million in 2011 from $161 million in 2010. The
    increase was primarily due to growth in the Asia Pacific region,
    the impact of currency and reduced investment in Russia.

Earnings from International Simple Meals and Beverages increased
    to $161 million in 2010 from $69 million in 2009.
    Earnings in 2009 included a $67 million impairment charge
    on certain European trademarks, including

Heisse Tasse

,

Blå Band

and

Royco

. Excluding the impairment
    charge, the increase in operating earnings was primarily due to
    the impact of currency and growth in the businesses in Europe as
    well as Asia Pacific, partially offset by declines in Canada.

Earnings from North America Foodservice increased to
    $82 million in 2011 from $55 million in 2010 primarily
    due to reduced promotional spending, productivity improvements
    in excess of inflation, and lower administrative expense.

Earnings from North America Foodservice increased to
    $55 million in 2010 from $53 million in 2009 due
    primarily to cost reduction efforts.

Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $2 million from
    $121 million in 2010 to $119 million in 2011.

Unallocated corporate expenses increased from $107 million
    in 2009 to $121 million in 2010. The increase was primarily
    due to foreign exchange gains recorded in 2009 and higher
    equity-related benefit costs in 2010.

Interest
    Expense/Income

Interest expense increased to $122 million in 2011 from
    $112 million in 2010 primarily due to an increase in
    fixed-rate debt and higher debt levels. Interest income
    increased to $11 million in 2011 from $6 million in
    2010 primarily due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents.

Interest expense increased to $112 million in 2010 from
    $110 million in 2009 primarily due to an increase in
    fixed-rate debt and higher average debt levels, partially offset
    by lower average short-term rates. Interest income increased to
    $6 million in 2010 from $4 million in 2009 primarily
    due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents.

Taxes
    on Earnings

The effective tax rate was 31.3% in 2011, 32.0% in 2010, and
    32.2% in 2009. The reduction in the effective tax rate in 2011
    from 2010 was primarily due to $10 million of deferred tax
    expense recognized in 2010 as a result of the enactment of
    U.S. health care legislation. The law changed the tax
    treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription
    drug benefits to retirees. The company recorded the adjustment
    to reduce the value of the deferred tax asset associated with
    the subsidy.

In addition to the deferred tax expense recognized in 2010
    related to the enactment of health care legislation, the change
    in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 was impacted by
    additional tax expense in 2009 associated with the repatriation
    of foreign earnings.

Restructuring
    Charges

    Initiatives

On June 28, 2011, the company announced a series of
    initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce
    overhead costs across the organization to help fund plans to
    drive the growth of the business. The company also announced its
    intent to exit the Russian market. The company expects to
    eliminate approximately 750 positions in connection with these
    initiatives. Details of the plans include:

•

In Australia, the company will invest in a new system to
    automate packing operations at its biscuit plant in Virginia.
    This investment will occur over an

18-month

period and will result in the elimination of approximately 190
    positions, subject to union and employee consultations. Further,
    the company will improve asset utilization in the U.S. by
    shifting production of

ready-to-serve

soups from Paris, Texas, to other facilities in 2012. In
    addition, the manufacturing facility in Marshall, Michigan, was
    closed in 2011,


and manufacturing of

Campbell’s Soup at Hand

microwavable products will be consolidated at the Maxton,
    North Carolina, plant in 2012.

•

The company streamlined its salaried workforce by approximately
    510 positions around the world, including approximately 130
    positions at its world headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. These
    actions were substantially completed in 2011. As part of this
    initiative, the company outsourced a larger portion of its
    U.S. retail merchandising activities to its current retail
    sales agent, Acosta Sales and Marketing, and eliminated
    approximately 190 positions. The company expects that this
    action will enhance merchandising effectiveness and coverage for
    its U.S. customers.

•

In connection with exiting the Russian market, the company will
    eliminate approximately 50 positions. The exit process commenced
    in 2011 and is expected to be completed in fiscal 2012.

In 2011, the company recorded a restructuring charge of
    $63 million ($41 million after tax or $.12 per share)
    related to these initiatives. A summary of the pre-tax charge
    and remaining costs associated with the initiatives is as
    follows:

Of the aggregate $75 million of pre-tax costs, the company
    expects approximately $50 million will be cash
    expenditures, the majority of which will be spent in 2012. In
    addition, the company expects to invest approximately
    $40 million in capital expenditures in connection with the
    actions. The cash outflows related to these programs are not
    expected to have a material adverse impact on the company’s
    liquidity. The initiatives are expected to be completed by the
    end of fiscal 2013.

The initiatives included in this program are expected to
    generate annual pre-tax cash savings of approximately
    $60 million beginning in fiscal 2012 and increasing to
    approximately $70 million in fiscal 2014.

The total pre-tax costs of $75 million associated with each
    segment are expected to be as follows: U.S. Simple
    Meals — $33 million,
    U.S. Beverages — $3 million, Global Baking
    and Snacking — $15 million, International Simple
    Meals and Beverages — $18 million, North America
    Foodservice — $1 million, and
    Corporate — $5 million. Segment operating results
    do not include restructuring charges as segment performance is
    evaluated excluding such charges.

    Initiatives

On April 28, 2008, the company announced a series of
    initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term
    profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands
    and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities
    in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the company’s
    management structure.

As a result of these initiatives, in 2009, the company recorded
    approximately $22 million ($15 million after tax or
    $.04 per share) of costs in Cost of products sold. Approximately
    $17 million ($12 million after tax) of the costs
    represented accelerated depreciation on property, plant and
    equipment; approximately $4 million ($2 million after
    tax) related to other exit costs; and approximately
    $1 million related to employee severance and benefit costs,
    including other pension charges.

As a result of these initiatives, in 2010, the company recorded
    a restructuring charge of $12 million ($8 million
    after tax or $.02 per share) for pension benefit costs, which
    represented the final costs associated with the 2008 initiatives.


Details of the impact of the initiatives on fiscal 2010 and 2009
    results are as follows:

•

In April 2008, as part of the initiatives, the company announced
    plans to close the Listowel, Ontario, Canada food plant. The
    Listowel facility produced primarily frozen products, including
    soup, entrees, and Pepperidge Farm products, as well as ramen
    noodles. The facility employed approximately 500 people.
    The company closed the facility in April 2009. Production was
    transitioned to its network of North American contract
    manufacturers and to its Downingtown, Pennsylvania, plant. In
    connection with this action in 2009, the company recorded
    $1 million of employee severance and benefit costs,
    including other pension charges; $16 million
    ($11 million after tax) in accelerated depreciation of
    property, plant and equipment; and $2 million
    ($1 million after tax) of other exit costs. In 2010, the
    company recorded a restructuring charge of $12 million
    ($8 million after tax) for pension benefit costs, which
    represented the final costs associated with the initiatives.

•

In April 2008, as part of the initiatives, the company also
    announced plans to discontinue the private label biscuit and
    industrial chocolate production at its Miranda, Australia,
    facility. The company closed the Miranda facility, which
    employed approximately 150 people, in the second quarter of
    2009. In connection with this action in 2009, the company
    recorded $1 million in accelerated depreciation of
    property, plant and equipment and $2 million
    ($1 million after tax) of other exit costs.

In aggregate, the company incurred pre-tax costs of
    $216 million in 2008 through 2010 associated with the
    initiatives. Approximately $40 million of the costs were
    cash expenditures, the majority of which was spent in 2009.

In aggregate, the company incurred pre-tax costs of
    $216 million in 2008 through 2010 by segment as follows:
    Global Baking and Snacking — $147 million,
    International Simple Meals and Beverages —
    $9 million and North America Foodservice —
    $60 million.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

Discontinued
    Operations

On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its
    Godiva Chocolatier business for $850 million, pursuant to a
    Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The
    purchase price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments,
    which resulted in an additional $20 million of proceeds. In
    fiscal 2009, the company recognized a $4 million tax
    benefit as a result of an adjustment to the tax liability
    associated with the sale.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The company expects that foreseeable liquidity and capital
    resource requirements, including cash outflows to repurchase
    shares, pay dividends and fund pension plan contributions, will
    be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term
    borrowings under its shelf registration statement; short-term
    borrowings, including commercial paper; and cash and cash
    equivalents. Over the last three years, operating cash flows
    totaled approximately $3.4 billion. This cash-generating
    capability provides the company with substantial financial
    flexibility in meeting its operating and investing needs. The
    company expects that its sources of financing are adequate to
    meet its future liquidity and capital resource requirements. The
    cost and terms of any future financing arrangements may be
    negatively impacted by capital and credit market disruptions and
    will depend on the market conditions and the company’s
    financial position at the time.

The company generated cash from operations of
    $1.142 billion in 2011, compared to $1.057 billion in
    2010. The increase was primarily due to lower pension
    contributions and higher cash earnings, partially offset by
    higher working capital requirements.

The company generated cash from operations of
    $1.057 billion in 2010, compared to $1.166 billion in
    2009. The decline was primarily due to a $260 million
    contribution to a U.S. pension plan in 2010, partially
    offset by improvements in working capital requirements.

Capital expenditures were $272 million in 2011,
    $315 million in 2010, and $345 million in 2009.
    Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately
    $325 million in 2012. Capital expenditures in 2011 included
    the expansion of beverage capacity (approximately
    $6 million); the ongoing implementation of SAP
    (approximately


$13 million); expenditures at the company’s corporate
    headquarters (approximately $6 million); Pepperidge
    Farm’s new 34,000-square-foot innovation center
    (approximately $5 million); expansion of Pepperidge
    Farm’s production capacity (approximately $5 million)
    and a number of infrastructure projects in the U.S. supply
    chain (approximately $31 million). Capital expenditures in
    2010 included expansion and enhancements of the company’s
    corporate headquarters (approximately $36 million);
    expansion of Arnott’s production capacity (approximately
    $21 million); the ongoing implementation of SAP in
    Australia and New Zealand (approximately $15 million) and
    expansion of Pepperidge Farm’s production capacity
    (approximately $14 million). Capital expenditures in 2009
    included expansion of the U.S. beverage production capacity
    (approximately $54 million) and expansion and enhancements
    of the company’s corporate headquarters (approximately
    $20 million).

Business acquired, as presented in the Statements of Cash Flows,
    represented the acquisition of the Ecce Panis, Inc. business in
    the fourth quarter of 2009.

Net cash used in investing activities in 2009 included
    $38 million of proceeds from the sale of the sauce and
    mayonnaise business in France, net of cash divested.

Long-term borrowings in 2011 included the issuance in April of
    $500 million of 4.25% notes which mature on
    April 15, 2021. Long-term borrowings in 2010 included the
    issuance in July of $400 million of 3.05% notes that
    mature in July 2017. Long-term borrowings in 2009 included the
    issuance in January of $300 million of 4.5% notes that
    mature in February 2019 and the issuance in July of
    $300 million of 3.375% notes that mature in August
    2014. The net proceeds from these issuances were used for the
    repayment of commercial paper borrowings and for other general
    corporate purposes.

Dividend payments were $378 million in 2011,
    $365 million in 2010, and $350 million in 2009. Annual
    dividends declared in 2011 were $1.145 per share, $1.075 per
    share in 2010, and $1.00 per share in 2009. The 2011 fourth
    quarter rate was $0.29 per share.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares and
    for stock option exercises, the company repurchased
    21 million shares at a cost of $728 million during
    2011. Approximately 16 million of the shares repurchased in
    2011 were repurchased pursuant to the company’s June 2008
    publicly announced share repurchase program. Under this program,
    the company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of
    up to $1.2 billion of company stock through the end of
    fiscal 2011. This program was completed in fiscal 2011. In June
    2011, the company’s Board of Directors authorized the
    purchase of up to $1 billion of company stock. This program
    has no expiration date. In addition to these publicly announced
    share repurchase programs, the company also purchased shares to
    offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the
    company’s stock compensation plans. The company expects to
    continue this practice in the future. See “Market for
    Registrant’s Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and
    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for more information.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares and
    for stock option exercises, the company repurchased
    14 million shares at a cost of $472 million during
    2010. Approximately 7 million of the shares repurchased in
    2010 were repurchased pursuant to the company’s June 2008
    publicly announced share repurchase program. In addition to the
    June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase program, the
    company also purchased shares to offset the impact of dilution
    from shares issued under the company’s stock compensation
    plans.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares,
    the company repurchased 17 million shares at a cost of
    $527 million during 2009. Approximately 13 million of
    the shares repurchased in 2009 were repurchased pursuant to the
    company’s June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase
    program. In addition to the June 2008 publicly announced share
    repurchase program, the company also purchased shares to offset
    the impact of dilution from shares issued under the
    company’s stock compensation plans.

At July 31, 2011, the company had $657 million of
    short-term borrowings due within one year and $45 million
    of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company.
    The company had a $975 million committed revolving credit
    facility that matured in September 2011, and a $975 million
    revolving credit facility that was due to mature in September
    2013. The facilities were unused at July 31, 2011, except
    for $3 million of standby letters of credit issued


on behalf of the company. In September 2011, the company entered
    into committed revolving credit facilities totaling
    $2.0 billion. The facilities are comprised of a
    $1.5 billion facility that matures in September 2016, and a
    $500 million,

364-day

facility that contains a one-year term-out feature. These
    facilities replaced the two $975 million revolving credit
    facilities. These revolving credit agreements support the
    company’s commercial paper programs and other general
    corporate purposes.

In November 2008, the company filed a registration statement
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an
    indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration
    statement, the company may issue debt securities, depending on
    market conditions.

The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its
    revolving credit facilities and debt securities.

Contractual
    Obligations

The following table summarizes the company’s obligations
    and commitments to make future payments under certain
    contractual obligations. For additional information on debt, see
    Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating
    leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office
    facilities and certain equipment. Purchase commitments represent
    purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements related to
    the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment
    and services. These commitments are not expected to have a
    material impact on liquidity. Other long-term liabilities
    primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation
    obligations. For additional information on other long-term
    liabilities, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments

The company guarantees approximately 2,000 bank loans to
    Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third-party
    financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The
    maximum potential amount of the future payments the company
    could be required to make under the guarantees is
    $162 million. The company’s guarantees are indirectly
    secured by the distribution routes. The company does not believe
    that it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee
    payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed.
    In connection with the sale of certain Australian salty snack
    food brands and assets, the company agreed to provide a loan
    facility to the buyer of AUD $10 million, or approximately
    USD $10 million. The facility was drawn down in AUD
    $5 million increments in 2009. Borrowings under the
    facility are to be repaid in 2013. See also Note 18 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off-balance
    sheet arrangements.

Inflation

In fiscal 2011, inflation was higher than fiscal 2010 and
    primarily impacted Cost of products sold, although it did not
    increase at percentages similar to fiscal 2009. Inflation, on
    average, was higher in fiscal 2009 and primarily impacted Cost
    of products sold. In fiscal 2010, inflation was not as
    significant. The company uses a number of strategies to mitigate
    the effects of cost inflation. These strategies include
    increasing prices, commodity hedging and pursuing cost
    productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies
    and making capital investments that improve the efficiency of
    operations.

Market
    Risk Sensitivity

The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and
    commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity
    price changes related to certain deferred compensation
    obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in
    interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and
    fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to
    maintain its

variable-to-total

debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations,
    which accounted for approximately 31% of 2011 net sales,
    are concentrated principally in Australia, Canada, France,
    Germany and Belgium. The company manages its foreign currency
    exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and
    utilizing cross-currency swaps and forward contracts.
    Cross-currency swaps and forward contracts are entered into for
    periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not
    constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company
    does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and does
    not use leveraged instruments.

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders
    and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in
    connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain
    commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters
    into commodity futures and option contracts to reduce the
    volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, wheat, natural
    gas, soybean oil, aluminum, sugar, cocoa, and corn, which impact
    the cost of raw materials.

The information below summarizes the company’s market risks
    associated with debt obligations and other significant financial
    instruments as of July 31, 2011. Fair values included
    herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or
    pricing models using current market rates. The information
    presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 13
    through 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


The table below presents principal cash flows and related
    interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations.
    Interest rates disclosed on variable-rate debt maturing in 2011
    represent the weighted-average rates at the period end. Notional
    amounts and related interest rates of interest rate swaps are
    presented by fiscal year of maturity. For the swaps, variable
    rates are the weighted-average forward rates for the term of
    each contract.

As of August 1, 2010, fixed-rate debt of approximately
    $2.6 billion with an average interest rate of 5.21% and
    variable-rate debt of approximately $130 million with an
    average interest rate of 1.47% were outstanding. As of
    August 1, 2010, the company had swapped $500 million
    of fixed-rate debt to variable. The average rate to be received
    on these swaps was 4.95% and the average rate paid was estimated
    to be 1.38% over the remaining life of the swaps.

The company is exposed to foreign exchange risk related to its
    international operations, including non-functional currency
    intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries. The
    following table summarizes the cross-currency swaps outstanding
    as of July 31, 2011, which hedge such

The cross-currency swap contracts outstanding at August 1,
    2010 represented four pay variable EUR/receive variable USD
    swaps with notional values totaling $200 million, one pay
    fixed EUR/receive fixed USD swap with a notional value of
    $102 million, two pay variable CAD/receive variable USD
    swaps with notional values totaling $119 million, two pay
    variable AUD/receive variable USD swaps with notional values
    totaling $266 million, and one pay fixed CAD/receive fixed
    USD swap with a notional value of $60 million. The
    aggregate notional value of these swap contracts was
    $747 million as of August 1, 2010, and the aggregate
    fair value of these swap contracts was a loss of
    $21 million as of August 1, 2010.

The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result
    of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency
    of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. The company
    utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to
    hedge these exposures. The following table summarizes the
    foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related

The company had an additional $22 million in a number of
    smaller contracts to purchase or sell various other currencies,
    such as the Australian dollar, British Pound, euro, and Japanese
    yen, as of July 31, 2011. The aggregate fair value of all
    contracts was a loss of $9 million as of July 31,
    2011. The total forward exchange contracts outstanding were
    $271 million and the aggregate fair value was not material
    as of August 1, 2010.

The company enters into commodity futures and options contracts
    to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities.
    The notional value of these contracts was $87 million and
    the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of
    $1 million as of July 31, 2011. The notional value of
    these contracts was $50 million and the aggregate fair
    value of these contracts was a gain of $3 million as of
    August 1, 2010.

The company enters into swap contracts which hedge a portion of
    exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations
    linked to the total return of the Standard &
    Poor’s 500 Index, the total return of the company’s
    capital stock and the total return of the Puritan Fund, or
    beginning in January 2011, the total return of the Vanguard
    International Stock Index. Under these contracts, the company
    pays variable interest rates and receives from the counterparty
    either the total return of the Standard & Poor’s
    500 Index, the total return on company capital stock, the total
    return of the Puritan Fund, or the total return of the iShares
    MSCI EAFE Index, which is expected to approximate the total
    return of the Vanguard International Stock Index. The notional
    value of the contract that is linked to the return on the
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was $16 million
    at July 31, 2011 and $12 million at August 1,
    2010. The average forward interest rate applicable to the
    contract, which expires in 2012, was 0.59% at July 31,
    2011. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the
    total return on company capital stock was $51 million at
    July 31, 2011 and $54 million at August 1, 2010.
    The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract,
    which expires in 2012, was 0.99% at July 31, 2011. The
    notional value of the contract that was linked to the return on
    the Puritan Fund was $9 million at August 1, 2010. The
    contract related to the Puritan Fund matured in January 2011.
    The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total
    return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index was $4 million at
    July 31, 2011. The average forward interest rate applicable
    to this contract, which expires in 2012, was 0.74% at
    July 31, 2011. The fair value of these contracts was a
    $3 million loss at July 31, 2011 and a $2 million
    loss at August 1, 2010.

The company’s utilization of financial instruments in
    managing market risk exposures described above is consistent
    with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial
    instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt
    repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign
    currency, and the company’s acquisition and divestiture
    activities.

Significant
    Accounting Estimates

The consolidated financial statements of the company are
    prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States. The preparation of these
    financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported
    amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates and
    assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies.
    The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex
    judgments, estimates and assumptions:

Trade and consumer promotion programs

— The
    company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and
    consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display
    incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product
    introduction fees, and coupons. The mix between promotion
    programs, which are classified as reductions in revenue, and
    advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified
    as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods
    based on the company’s overall marketing plans, and such
    fluctuations have an impact on revenues. The measurement and
    recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion
    programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and
    redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical
    experience and other factors. Typically, programs that are
    offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference
    between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and
    performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual
    financial statements. However, actual expenses may differ if the
    level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from
    estimates.


Valuation of long-lived assets

— Fixed assets
    and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as
    events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the
    carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted
    cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment
    exists. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is
    calculated based on estimated fair value.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at
    least annually for impairment, or as events or changes in
    circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the
    asset may not be recoverable.

Goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison of the
    fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value. A
    reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of
    an operating segment. Fair value is determined based on
    discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of
    future cash flows include significant management assumptions
    such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted
    average cost of capital, and future economic and market
    conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds
    fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the
    impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the
    goodwill and the “implied” fair value, which is
    calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and
    accounted for as a business combination. As of July 31,
    2011, the carrying value of goodwill was $2.133 billion.
    The company has not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a
    result of annual testing, which began in 2003. As of the 2011
    measurement, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the
    carrying value by at least 80%. Holding all other assumptions
    used in the 2011 measurement constant, a 100-basis-point
    increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not
    result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in
    excess of the fair value.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by
    comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value.
    Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses
    that include significant management assumptions such as revenue
    growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed
    royalty rates. If the fair value is less than the carrying
    value, the asset is reduced to fair value. As of July 31,
    2011, the carrying value of trademarks was $515 million. In
    2011, as part of the company’s annual review of intangible
    assets, an impairment charge of $3 million was recognized
    related to the

Heisse Tasse

trademark used in the
    International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The trademark
    was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the
    fair value of the brand, resulting from reduced expectations for
    future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the
    prior year. As of July 31, 2011, certain European
    trademarks have a carrying value of approximately
    $100 million, which approximates fair value. Holding all
    other assumptions used in the 2011 measurement constant, a
    100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital
    would reduce the fair value of all trademarks and result in an
    impairment charge of approximately $21 million. In 2009, as
    part of the company’s annual review of intangible assets,
    an impairment charge of $67 million was recognized related
    to certain European trademarks used in the International Simple
    Meals and Beverages segment, including

Heisse Tasse

,

Blå Band

and

Royco

. The trademarks were
    determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair
    value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations for
    discounted cash flows in comparison to prior year. The reduction
    was due in part to a deterioration in market conditions and an
    increase in the weighted average cost of capital. See
    Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.

The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable
    management judgment and are based upon assumptions about
    expected future operating performance, economic conditions,
    market conditions, and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating
    the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the
    company’s control, such as capital markets. The actual cash
    flows could differ from management’s estimates due to
    changes in business conditions, operating performance, and
    economic conditions.

Pension and postretirement benefits

— The
    company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to
    employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with
    such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions,
    including discount rates, expected return on plan assets,
    compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend
    rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the
    required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that
    differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated
    and amortized over future periods.

The discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal
    year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate,
    the company reviews published market indices of high-quality
    debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In
    addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield
    curves to the expected benefit


payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a
    long-term assumption based upon historical experience and
    expected future performance, considering the company’s
    current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on
    an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real
    returns for each asset class, and a premium for active
    management. Within any given fiscal period, significant
    differences may arise between the actual return and the expected
    return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in the
    calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated
    method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual
    fair value of assets and the expected calculated method. Gains
    and losses resulting from differences between actual experience
    and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. If
    the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets
    or liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the
    following year.

Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was
    $98 million in 2011, $92 million in 2010, and
    $53 million in 2009. The 2010 expense included
    $12 million of pension settlement costs related to the
    closure of a plant in Canada. Significant weighted-average
    assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows:

Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are
    as follows: a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate
    would increase expense by approximately $14 million; a
    50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets
    assumption would increase expense by approximately
    $12 million. A one-percentage-point increase in assumed
    health care costs would increase postretirement service and
    interest cost by approximately $1 million.

Net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to
    increase to approximately $103 million in 2012 primarily
    due to increased amortization of unrecognized losses.

The company contributed $100 million to U.S. pension
    plans in 2011. Given the adverse impact of declining financial
    markets on the funding levels of the plans, the company
    contributed $260 million to a U.S. plan in 2010.

plans were $44 million in 2011, $24 million in 2010,
    and $13 million in 2009. The company contributed
    $55 million to U.S. plans in the first quarter of
    2012. Additional contributions to U.S. plans are not
    expected in 2012. Contributions to

non-U.S. plans

are expected to be approximately $10 million in 2012.

    for additional information on pension and postretirement
    expenses.

Income taxes

— The effective tax rate reflects
    statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the
    various jurisdictions in which the company operates and
    management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various
    tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in
    determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax
    positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable
    or payable in the current year and include the effect of
    deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the future impact of differences between the
    financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
    and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss
    and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences
    are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances
    are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely
    than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

See also Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion on income taxes.


Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In addition to the guidance related to the calculation of
    earnings per share described in Note 9 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, recent accounting pronouncements are as
    follows:

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued authoritative guidance which establishes
    accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
    subsidiary. It requires a noncontrolling interest in a
    subsidiary, which was formerly known as minority interest, to be
    classified as a separate component of total equity in the
    consolidated financial statements. The company retrospectively
    adopted the new noncontrolling interest guidance in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not have a material
    impact on the financial statements. See Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that
    changed the consolidation model for variable interest entities.
    The provisions were effective for the first quarter of fiscal
    2011. The adoption did not have a material impact on the
    company’s consolidated financial statements.

In January 2010, the FASB issued additional authoritative
    guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The
    guidance requires disclosure of details of significant transfers
    in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value
    measurements. Level 1 fair value measurements are based on
    unadjusted quoted market prices. Level 2 fair value
    measurements are based on significant inputs, other than
    Level 1, that are observable for the asset/liability
    through corroboration with observable market data. The guidance
    also clarifies the existing disclosure requirements for the
    level of disaggregation of fair value measurements and the
    disclosures on inputs and valuation techniques. The company
    adopted these provisions in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
    The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated
    financial statements. In addition, the guidance requires a gross
    presentation of the activity within the Level 3 roll
    forward, separately presenting information about purchases,
    sales, issuances and settlements. The roll forward information
    must be provided by the company for the first quarter of fiscal
    2012, as the provision is effective for annual reporting periods
    beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim reporting
    periods within those years.

In November 2010, the FASB issued additional authoritative
    guidance clarifying the required disclosures of supplementary
    pro forma information for business combinations. The guidance is
    effective prospectively for business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2010.

In December 2010, the FASB issued additional authoritative
    guidance on accounting for goodwill. The guidance clarifies the
    impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative
    carrying amounts. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and
    interim periods within those years beginning after
    December 15, 2011. The company does not expect the adoption
    to have a material impact on the consolidated financial
    statements.

In May 2011, the FASB issued further additional authoritative
    guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The
    new guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value
    and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about
    fair value between accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States (U.S. GAAP) and International Financial
    Reporting Standards (IFRS). The guidance is effective for fiscal
    years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning
    after December 15, 2011. The company is assessing the
    impact of the guidance.

In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring
    entities to present net income and other comprehensive income
    (OCI) in one continuous statement or two separate, but
    consecutive, statements of net income and comprehensive income.
    The option to present items of OCI in the statement of changes
    in equity has been eliminated. The new requirements are
    effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
    December 15, 2011 and for interim reporting periods within
    those years.

See also Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further discussion on new accounting standards.


Cautionary
    Factors That May Affect Future Results

This Report contains “forward-looking” statements that
    reflect the company’s current expectations regarding future
    results of operations, economic performance, financial condition
    and achievements of the company. The company tries, wherever
    possible, to identify these forward-looking statements by using
    words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “estimate,” “expect,” “will,” and
    similar expressions. One can also identify them by the fact that
    they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
    These statements reflect the company’s current plans and
    expectations and are based on information currently available to
    it. They rely on a number of assumptions regarding future events
    and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are inherently
    subject to risks and uncertainties.

The company wishes to caution the reader that the following
    important factors and those important factors described in
    Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in the commentary, or in
    other Securities and Exchange Commission filings of the company,
    could affect the company’s actual results and could cause
    such results to vary materially from those expressed in any
    forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company:

•

the impact of strong competitive response to the company’s
    efforts to leverage its brand power with product innovation,
    promotional programs and new advertising, and of changes in
    consumer demand for the company’s products;

•

the risks in the marketplace associated with trade and consumer
    acceptance of product improvements, shelving initiatives, new
    product introductions, and pricing and promotional strategies;

•

the company’s ability to achieve sales and earnings
    guidance, which is based on assumptions about sales volume,
    product mix, the development and success of new products, the
    impact of marketing, promotional and pricing actions, product
    costs and currency;

•

the company’s ability to realize projected cost savings and
    benefits;

•

the company’s ability to successfully manage changes to its
    business processes, including selling, distribution,
    manufacturing, information management systems and the
    integration of acquisitions;

•

the increased significance of certain of the company’s key
    trade customers;

•

the impact of inventory management practices by the
    company’s trade customers;

•

the impact of fluctuations in the supply and inflation in
    energy, raw and packaging materials cost;

•

the impact associated with portfolio changes and completion of
    acquisitions and divestitures;

•

the uncertainties of litigation described from time to time in
    the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings;

•

the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, tax rates,
    interest rates, debt and equity markets, inflation rates,
    economic conditions and other external factors; and

•

the impact of unforeseen business disruptions in one or more of
    the company’s markets due to political instability, civil
    disobedience, armed hostilities, natural disasters or other
    calamities.

This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but
    is designed to highlight important factors that may impact the
    company’s outlook. The company disclaims any obligation or
    intent to update forward-looking statements made by the company
    in order to reflect new information, events or circumstances
    after the date they are made.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(currency in millions, except per share amounts)

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Campbell Soup Company, together with its subsidiaries (the
    company), is a global manufacturer and marketer of high-quality,
    branded convenience food products.

Basis of Presentation

— The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of the company and
    entities in which the company maintains a controlling financial
    interest. Intercompany transactions are eliminated in
    consolidation. Certain amounts in prior-year financial
    statements were reclassified to conform to the current-year
    presentation. The company’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday
    nearest July 31. There were 52 weeks in 2011, 2010 and
    2009.

Use of Estimates

— Generally accepted
    accounting principles require management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect assets and liabilities, contingent
    assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

— Revenues are recognized
    when the earnings process is complete. This occurs when products
    are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements, title and
    risk of loss transfer to customers, collection is probable and
    pricing is fixed or determinable. Revenues are recognized net of
    provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Certain sales
    promotion expenses, such as feature price discounts, in-store
    display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new
    product introduction fees and coupon redemption costs, are
    classified as a reduction of sales. The recognition of costs for
    promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to
    performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based
    on historical experience and other factors. Costs are recognized
    either upon sale or when the incentive is offered, based on the
    program.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— All highly liquid
    debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or
    less are classified as cash equivalents.

Inventories

— All inventories are valued at the
    lower of average cost or market.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant
    and equipment are recorded at historical cost and are
    depreciated over estimated useful lives using the straight-line
    method. Buildings and machinery and equipment are depreciated
    over periods not exceeding 45 years and 20 years,
    respectively. Assets are evaluated for impairment when
    conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Such conditions include significant adverse changes
    in business climate or a plan of disposal. Repairs and
    maintenance are charged to expense.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

— Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather
    are tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for
    impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur
    indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
    Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the
    estimated useful life and are also reviewed when appropriate for
    possible impairment. Goodwill impairment testing first requires
    a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the
    carrying value. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a
    component of an operating segment. If the carrying value of the
    reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered
    impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between
    the carrying value of goodwill and the “implied” fair
    value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just
    been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.
    Impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets
    requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying value
    of the asset. If carrying value exceeds the fair value, the
    asset is reduced to fair value. Fair values are primarily
    determined using discounted cash flow analyses. See Note 5
    for information on goodwill and other intangible assets.

Derivative Financial Instruments

— The company
    uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of
    hedging exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates, interest rates, commodities and equity-linked employee
    benefit obligations. These derivative contracts are entered into
    for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and
    do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The
    company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative
    purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The
    company’s derivative programs include strategies that both
    qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. To


NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at
    inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, shall be
    expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes
    in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the
    hedge is designated.

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair
    value. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, on the
    date the derivative contract is entered into, the company
    designates the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a
    recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (fair-value
    hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the
    variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a
    recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge), or a hedge of a
    net investment in a foreign operation. Some derivatives may also
    be considered natural hedging instruments (changes in fair value
    act as economic offsets to changes in fair value of the
    underlying hedged item) and are not designated for hedge
    accounting.

Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the
    gain or loss on the underlying hedged asset or liability
    (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in
    current-period earnings. The effective portion of gains and
    losses on cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive
    income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of
    cash flows. If the underlying hedged item ceases to exist, all
    changes in the fair value of the derivative are included in
    earnings each period until the instrument matures. If a
    derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
    operation, its changes in fair value, to the extent effective as
    a hedge, are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Any
    ineffective portion of designated hedges is recognized in
    current-period earnings. Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting are
    recognized in current-period earnings.

Cash flows from derivative contracts are included in Net cash
    provided by operating activities.

Advertising Production Costs

— Advertising
    production costs are expensed in the period that the
    advertisement first takes place.

Research and Development Costs

— The costs of
    research and development are expensed as incurred. Costs include
    expenditures for new product and manufacturing process
    innovation, and improvements to existing products and processes.
    Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting, and
    depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and
    equipment.

Income Taxes

— Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences
    between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
    and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
    on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
    is recognized in income in the period that includes the
    enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce
    deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax
    benefit will not be realized.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued authoritative guidance which establishes
    accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
    subsidiary. It requires a noncontrolling interest in a
    subsidiary, which was formerly known as minority interest, to be
    classified as a separate component of total equity in the
    consolidated financial statements. The company retrospectively
    adopted the new noncontrolling interest guidance in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not have a material
    impact on the financial statements. See Note 10 for
    additional information.

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for
    business combinations, which establishes the principles and
    requirements for how an acquirer recognizes the assets acquired,
    the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
    acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values
    as of that date with limited exceptions. The guidance requires
    acquisition-related transaction costs to be expensed as incurred
    rather than capitalized as a component of the business
    combination. The provisions as revised were effective as of the
    first quarter of fiscal 2010 and will be applied to any business
    combinations entered into thereafter.


NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for
    fair value measurements, which establishes a definition of fair
    value, provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    the disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. This
    guidance does not require any new fair value measurements but
    rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that
    require or permit fair value measurements. In February 2008, the
    FASB issued authoritative guidance which delayed by a year the
    effective date for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities.
    The company adopted the provisions of the guidance for financial
    assets and liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The
    adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated
    financial statements. The company adopted the remaining
    provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for nonfinancial
    assets and liabilities, including goodwill and intangible
    assets. The adoption likewise did not have a material impact on
    the consolidated financial statements. See Note 15 for
    additional information.

In June 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to
    the calculation of earnings per share. The guidance provides
    that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
    non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
    (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall
    be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to
    the two-class method. Upon adoption, a company is required to
    retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data (including
    any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings
    and selected financial data) to conform with the new provisions.
    The company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal
    2010. Prior periods have been restated. See Note 9 for
    additional information.

In December 2008, the FASB issued additional authoritative
    guidance related to employers’ disclosures about the plan
    assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans.
    The required disclosures include a description of how investment
    allocation decisions are made, major categories of plan assets,
    valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan
    assets, the impact of measurements using significant
    unobservable inputs and concentrations of risk within plan
    assets. The disclosures about plan assets required by this
    additional guidance must be provided for fiscal years ending
    after December 15, 2009. The company adopted the provisions
    in fiscal 2010. See Note 11 for additional information.

In January 2010, the FASB issued additional authoritative
    guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The
    guidance requires disclosure of details of significant transfers
    in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value
    measurements. Level 1 fair value measurements are based on
    unadjusted quoted market prices. Level 2 fair value
    measurements are based on significant inputs, other than
    Level 1, that are observable for the asset/liability
    through corroboration with observable market data. The guidance
    also clarifies the existing disclosure requirements for the
    level of disaggregation of fair value measurements and the
    disclosures on inputs and valuation techniques. The company
    adopted these provisions in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
    The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated
    financial statements. In addition, the guidance requires a gross
    presentation of the activity within the Level 3 roll
    forward, separately presenting information about purchases,
    sales, issuances and settlements. The roll forward information
    must be provided by the company for the first quarter of fiscal
    2012, as the provision is effective for annual reporting periods
    beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim reporting
    periods within those years.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that
    changed the consolidation model for variable interest entities.
    The provisions were effective for the first quarter of fiscal
    2011. The adoption did not have a material impact on the
    company’s consolidated financial statements.

In November 2010, the FASB issued additional authoritative
    guidance clarifying the required disclosures of supplementary
    pro forma information for business combinations. The guidance is
    effective prospectively for business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2010.

In December 2010, the FASB issued additional authoritative
    guidance on accounting for goodwill. The guidance clarifies the
    impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative
    carrying amounts. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and
    interim periods within those years beginning after
    December 15, 2011. The company does not expect the adoption
    to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated
    financial statements.


NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In May 2011, the FASB issued further additional authoritative
    guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The
    new guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value
    and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about
    fair value between accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States (U.S. GAAP) and International Financial
    Reporting Standards (IFRS). The guidance is effective for fiscal
    years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning
    after December 15, 2011. The company is assessing the
    impact of the guidance.

In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring
    entities to present net income and other comprehensive income
    (OCI) in one continuous statement or two separate, but
    consecutive, statements of net income and comprehensive income.
    The option to present items of OCI in the statement of changes
    in equity has been eliminated. The new requirements are
    effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
    December 15, 2011 and for interim reporting periods within
    those years.

Divestitures

Discontinued
    Operations

On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its
    Godiva Chocolatier business for $850. The purchase price was
    subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in
    an additional $20 of proceeds. The company has reflected the
    results of this business as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of earnings. The company used
    approximately $600 of the net proceeds to purchase company
    stock. The company recognized a $4 benefit in 2009 as a result
    of an adjustment to the tax liability associated with the sale.

Other
    Divestitures

In July 2008, the company entered into an agreement to sell its
    sauce and mayonnaise business comprised of products sold under
    the

Lesieur

brand in France. The company recorded a
    pre-tax impairment charge of $2 to adjust the net assets to
    estimated realizable value in 2008. The sale was completed on
    September 29, 2008 and resulted in $36 of proceeds. The
    purchase price was subject to working capital and other
    post-closing adjustments, which resulted in an additional $6 of
    proceeds. The business was historically included in the
    International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.

The company has provided certain indemnifications in connection
    with the divestitures. Known exposures related to such matters
    are not material.

Comprehensive
    Income

Total comprehensive income is comprised of net earnings, net
    foreign currency translation adjustments, pension and
    postretirement benefit adjustments (see Note 11), and net
    unrealized gains and losses on cash-flow hedges (see
    Note 14). Total comprehensive income for the twelve months
    ended July 31, 2011, August 1, 2010, and
    August 2, 2009 was $1,111, $826, and $154, respectively.

intangible assets consist of trademarks, which mainly include

. Amortizable intangible assets consist substantially
    of process technology and customer intangibles.

Amortization was less than $1 in 2011, 2010, and 2009. The
    estimated aggregated amortization expense for each of the five
    succeeding fiscal years is less than $1 per year. Asset useful
    lives range from ten to twenty years.

In 2011, as part of the company’s annual review of
    intangible assets, an impairment charge of $3 was recognized
    related to the

Heisse Tasse

trademark used in the
    International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The trademark
    was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the
    fair value of the brand, resulting from reduced expectations for
    future sales and discounted cash flows. The impairment charge
    was recorded in Other expenses/(income) in the Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings. As of July 2011, certain European
    trademarks have a carrying value of approximately $100, which
    approximates fair value. Fair value is determined based on
    discounted cash flow analyses that include significant
    management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted
    average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. Actual cash
    flows could differ from management’s estimates due to
    changes in business performance, operating performance, and
    economic conditions. Holding all other assumptions constant, a
    100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital
    would reduce fair value of all trademarks and result in
    impairment charges of approximately $21.


NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2009, as part of the company’s annual review of
    intangible assets, an impairment charge of $67 was recognized
    related to certain European trademarks used in the International
    Simple Meals and Beverages segment, including

Heisse
    Tasse

,

Blå Band

and

Royco

. The trademarks
    were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the
    fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations
    for discounted cash flows. The reduction was due in part to a
    deterioration in market conditions and an increase in the
    weighted average cost of capital. The impairment charge was
    recorded in Other expenses/(income) in the Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings.

In May 2009, the company acquired Ecce Panis, Inc. Intangible
    assets from the acquisition totaled $16. See Note 8 for
    additional information.

Business
    and Geographic Segment Information

Commencing with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the company
    reports the results of operations in the following reportable
    segments: U.S. Simple Meals; U.S. Beverages; Global
    Baking and Snacking; International Simple Meals and Beverages;
    and North America Foodservice. Segment results of prior periods
    were modified to conform to the current presentation. The
    company has ten operating segments based on product type and
    geographic location and has aggregated the operating segments
    into the appropriate reportable segment based on similar
    economic characteristics; products; production processes; types
    or classes of customers; distribution methods; and regulatory
    environment. The segments are discussed in greater detail below.

The U.S. Simple Meals segment aggregates the following
    operating segments: U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. The
    U.S. Soup retail business includes the following products:

Campbell’s

condensed and

ready-to-serve

soups; and

Swanson

broth and stocks. The U.S. Sauces
    retail business includes the following products:

Prego

pasta sauce;

Pace

Mexican sauce;

Swanson

canned poultry; and

Campbell’s

canned gravies,
    pasta and beans.

The U.S. Beverages segment represents the U.S. retail
    beverages business, including the following products:

V8

juices and beverages; and

Campbell’s

tomato
    juice.

The Global Baking and Snacking segment aggregates the following
    operating segments:

Pepperidge Farm

cookies, crackers,
    bakery and frozen products in U.S. retail; and

Arnott’s

biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific.

The International Simple Meals and Beverages segment aggregates
    the simple meals and beverages operating segments outside of the
    United States, including Europe, Latin America, the Asia Pacific
    region and the retail business in Canada. See Note 3 for
    information on the sale of the sauce and mayonnaise business
    comprised of products sold under the

Lesieur

brand in
    France. This business was historically included in this segment.

The North America Foodservice segment represents the
    distribution of products such as soup, specialty entrees,
    beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm
    products through various food service channels in the United
    States and Canada.

The company’s accounting policies for measuring segment
    assets and earnings before interest and taxes are substantially
    consistent with those described in Note 1. The company
    evaluates segment performance before interest, taxes, and
    beginning in fiscal 2011, costs associated with restructuring
    activities. Segment operating earnings of prior periods were
    modified to conform to the current presentation. The
    manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and selling activities
    of the company’s U.S. retail business are operated as
    an integrated platform in order to maximize efficiency and
    productivity. As a result, assets and capital expenditures of
    the U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages are not
    discretely maintained. Depreciation expense associated with the
    integrated operations, however, is allocated to the
    U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages segments based on
    production hours. North America Foodservice products are
    principally produced by the tangible assets of the
    company’s other segments, except for refrigerated soups,
    which are produced in a separate facility, and certain other
    products, which are produced under contract manufacturing
    agreements. Tangible assets of the company’s other segments
    are not allocated to the North America Foodservice operations.
    Depreciation, however, is allocated to North America Foodservice
    based on production hours.


NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and
    its affiliates, accounted for approximately 17% of consolidated
    net sales in 2011 and 18% in 2010 and 2009. All of the
    company’s segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
    or its affiliates.

Restructuring
    Charges

    Initiatives

On June 28, 2011, the company announced a series of
    initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce
    overhead costs across the organization to help fund plans to
    drive the growth of the business. The company also announced its
    intent to exit the Russian market. The company expects to
    eliminate approximately 750 positions in connection with these
    initiatives. Details of the plans include:

•

In Australia, the company will invest in a new system to
    automate packing operations at its biscuit plant in Virginia.
    This investment will occur over an

18-month

period and will result in the elimination of approximately 190
    positions, subject to union and employee consultations. Further,
    the company will improve asset utilization in the U.S. by
    shifting production of

ready-to-serve

soups from Paris, Texas, to other facilities in 2012. In
    addition, the manufacturing facility in Marshall, Michigan, was
    closed in 2011, and manufacturing of

Campbell’s Soup at
    Hand

microwavable products will be consolidated at the
    Maxton, North Carolina, plant in 2012.

•

The company streamlined its salaried workforce by approximately
    510 positions around the world, including approximately 130
    positions at its world headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. These
    actions were substantially completed in 2011. As part of this
    initiative, the company outsourced a larger portion of its
    U.S. retail merchandising activities to its current retail
    sales agent, Acosta Sales and Marketing, and eliminated
    approximately 190 positions. The company expects that this
    action will enhance merchandising effectiveness and coverage for
    its U.S. customers.

•

In connection with exiting the Russian market, the company will
    eliminate approximately 50 positions. The exit process commenced
    in 2011 and is expected to be completed in fiscal 2012.

In 2011, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $63 ($41
    after tax or $.12 per share) related to these initiatives. A
    summary of the pre-tax charge and remaining costs associated
    with the initiatives is as follows:

    invest approximately $40 in capital expenditures in connection
    with the actions. The initiatives are expected to be completed
    by the end of fiscal 2013.

    Corporate — $1. Segment operating results do not
    include restructuring charges as segment performance is
    evaluated excluding such charges.

    Initiatives

On April 28, 2008, the company announced a series of
    initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term
    profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands
    and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities
    in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the company’s
    management structure.

As a result of these initiatives, in 2009, the company recorded
    approximately $22 ($15 after tax or $.04 per share) of costs in
    Cost of products sold. Approximately $17 ($12 after tax) of the
    costs represented accelerated depreciation on property, plant
    and equipment; approximately $4 ($2 after tax) related to other
    exit costs; and approximately $1 related to employee severance
    and benefit costs, including other pension charges.

As a result of these initiatives, in 2010, the company recorded
    a restructuring charge of $12 ($8 after tax or $.02 per share)
    for pension benefit costs, which represented the final costs
    associated with the 2008 initiatives.

In the aggregate, the company incurred $216 of pre-tax costs for
    the total program in 2008 through 2010. Approximately $40 of the
    costs were cash expenditures, the majority of which was spent in
    2009.

Details of the impact of the initiatives on fiscal 2010 and 2009
    results are as follows:

•

In April 2008, as part of the initiatives, the company announced
    plans to close the Listowel, Ontario, Canada food plant. The
    Listowel facility produced primarily frozen products, including
    soup, entrees, and Pepperidge Farm products, as well as ramen
    noodles for North America Foodservice. The facility employed
    approximately 500 people. The company closed the facility
    in April 2009. Production was transitioned to its network of
    North American contract manufacturers and to its Downingtown,
    Pennsylvania, plant. In connection with this action, in 2009,
    the company recorded $1 of employee severance and benefit costs,
    including other pension charges; $16 ($11 after tax) in
    accelerated depreciation of property, plant and


NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

equipment; and $2 ($1 after tax) of other exit costs. In 2010,
    the company recorded a restructuring charge of $12 ($8 after
    tax) for pension benefit costs, which represented the final
    costs associated with the initiatives.

•

In April 2008, as part of the initiatives, the company also
    announced plans to discontinue the private label biscuit and
    industrial chocolate production at its Miranda, Australia,
    facility, which was part of Global Baking and Snacking. The
    company closed the Miranda facility, which employed
    approximately 150 people, in the second quarter of 2009. In
    connection with this action, in 2009, the company recorded $1 in
    accelerated depreciation of property, plant, and equipment, and
    $2 ($1 after tax) in other exit costs.

In 2008, as part of the initiatives, the company sold certain
    Australian salty snack food brands and assets, which were part
    of Global Baking and Snacking, and recorded a pre-tax net loss
    of $120 on the sale. The company streamlined its management
    structure and eliminated certain overhead costs. These actions
    began in the fourth quarter of 2008 and were substantially
    completed in 2009. In connection with this action, the company
    recorded $17 in employee severance and benefit costs in 2008.
    The company also recognized $45 in costs associated with the
    closures of the Listowel, Canada, and Miranda, Australia,
    facilities.

Acquisitions

On May 4, 2009, the company acquired Ecce Panis, Inc., an
    artisan bread maker, for $66. The results of operations of Ecce
    Panis, Inc. are included in the Global Baking and Snacking
    segment and were not material to 2009 results. The pro forma
    impact on sales, net earnings or earnings per share for the
    prior periods would not have been material. As part of the
    purchase price allocation, $46 was allocated to intangible
    assets, primarily consisting of goodwill, trade secret process
    technology, trademarks and customer relationships.

Earnings
    per Share

In June 2008, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to the
    calculation of earnings per share. The guidance provides that
    unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable
    rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or
    unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in
    the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class
    method. Share-based payment awards granted prior to fiscal 2011
    contained non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend
    equivalents. The two-class method is an earnings allocation
    formula that determines earnings per share for each class of
    common stock and participating security according to dividends
    declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The
    company adopted and retrospectively applied the new guidance in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The retrospective application
    of the provisions resulted in a reduction of basic and diluted
    earnings per share:

There were no antidilutive stock options in 2011. Stock options
    to purchase less than 1 million shares of capital stock in

Noncontrolling
    Interests

The company owns a 60% controlling interest in a joint venture
    formed with Swire Pacific Limited to support the development of
    the company’s business in China. The joint venture began
    operations on January 31, 2011, the beginning of the third
    fiscal quarter. At the inception of the joint venture, the joint
    venture partner contributed net assets of $7, including $9 of
    cash contributions, and the company made an $11 cash
    contribution. In July 2011, the


NOTES TO

company and joint venture partner contributed additional cash of
    $2 and $1, respectively. The noncontrolling interest’s
    share in the net loss was included in Net earnings (loss)
    attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings.

The company owns a 70% controlling interest in a Malaysian
    manufacturing company. The earnings attributable to the
    noncontrolling interest have historically been less than $1
    annually and were previously included in Other expense/(income)
    in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Beginning in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2011, the earnings attributable to the
    noncontrolling interest were included in Net earnings (loss)
    attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings. The earnings were not material in 2011.

The noncontrolling interests in these entities were included in
    Total equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated
    Statements of Equity.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

— The company sponsors a
    number of noncontributory defined benefit pension plans to
    provide retirement benefits to all eligible U.S. and

non-U.S. employees.

The benefits provided under these plans are based primarily on
    years of service and compensation levels. In 1999, the company
    implemented significant amendments to certain U.S. pension
    plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are determined
    based on percentages of annual pay and age. To minimize the
    impact of converting to the new formula, service and earnings
    credit continues to accrue for active employees participating in
    the plans under the old formula prior to the amendments through
    the year 2014. Employees will receive the benefit from either
    the new or old formula, whichever is higher. Benefits become
    vested upon the completion of three years of service. Benefits
    are paid from funds previously provided to trustees and
    insurance companies or are paid directly by the company from
    general funds. Effective as of January 1, 2011, the
    company’s U.S. pension plans were amended so that
    employees hired or rehired on or after that date and who are not
    covered by collective bargaining agreements will not be eligible
    to participate in the plans.

Postretirement Benefits

— The company provides
    postretirement benefits including health care and life insurance
    to substantially all retired U.S. employees and their
    dependents. The company established retiree medical account
    benefits for eligible U.S. retirees. The accounts were
    intended to provide reimbursement for eligible health care
    expenses on a tax-favored basis. Effective as of January 1,
    2011, the retirement medical program was amended to eliminate
    the retiree medical account benefit for employees not covered by
    collective bargaining agreements. To preserve the benefit for
    employees close to retirement age, the retiree medical account
    will be available to employees who were at least age 50
    with at least 10 years of service as of December 31,
    2010, and who satisfy the other eligibility requirements for the
    retiree medical program.

The company uses the fiscal year end as the measurement date for
    the benefit plans.

The changes in other comprehensive loss associated with pension
    benefits included the reclassification of actuarial losses into
    earnings of $70 and $49 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The
    remaining changes in other comprehensive loss associated with
    pension benefits were primarily due to net actuarial losses
    arising during the period and the impact of foreign currency.

The change in other comprehensive loss associated with
    postretirement benefits in 2011 was primarily due to net
    actuarial losses arising during the period. The change in other
    comprehensive loss associated with postretirement benefits in
    2010 included $50 of net actuarial losses arising during the
    period and $18 of prior service credit.

The discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal

    the company reviews published market indices of high-quality
    debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In
    addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield
    curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The
    expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based
    upon historical experience and expected future performance,
    considering the company’s current and projected investment
    mix.


NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation,
    long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a

Pension
    Plan Assets

The fundamental goal underlying the investment policy is to
    ensure that the assets of the plans are invested in a prudent
    manner to meet the obligations of the plans as these obligations
    come due. The primary investment objectives include providing a
    total return which will promote the goal of benefit security by
    attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan
    obligations, to provide for real asset growth while also
    tracking plan obligations, to diversify investments across and
    within asset classes, to reduce the impact of losses in single
    investments, and to follow investment practices that comply with
    applicable laws and regulations.

The primary policy objectives will be met by investing assets to
    achieve a reasonable tradeoff between return and risk relative
    to the plans’ obligations. This includes investing a
    portion of the assets in funds selected in part to hedge the
    interest rate sensitivity to plan obligations.

The portfolio includes investments in the following asset
    classes: fixed income, equity, real estate and alternatives.
    Fixed income will provide a moderate expected return and
    partially hedge the exposure to interest rate risk of the
    plans’ obligations. Equities are used for their high
    expected return. Additional asset classes are used to provide
    diversification.

Asset allocation is monitored on an ongoing basis relative to
    the established asset class targets. The interaction between
    plan assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied to
    assist in the establishment of strategic asset allocation
    targets. The investment policy permits variances from the
    targets within certain parameters. Asset rebalancing occurs when
    the underlying asset class allocations move outside these
    parameters, at which time the asset allocation is rebalanced
    back to the policy target weight.

Short-term investments

— Investments include
    cash and cash equivalents, and various short-term debt
    instruments and short-term investment funds. Institutional
    short-term investment vehicles valued daily are classified as
    Level 1 at cost which approximates market value. Other
    investment vehicles are valued based upon a net asset value and
    are classified as Level 2.

Equities

— Common stocks and preferred stocks
    are classified as Level 1 and are valued using quoted
    market prices in active markets.


NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Corporate bonds

— These investments are valued
    based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models
    using current market rates.

Government and agency bonds

— These investments
    are generally valued based on bid quotations and recent trade
    data for identical or similar obligations.

Municipal bonds

— These investments are valued
    based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models
    using current market rates.

Commingled funds

— Investments in commingled
    funds are classified as Level 2 assets as the funds are not
    traded in active markets. Commingled funds are valued based on
    the unit values of such funds. Unit values are based on the fair
    value of the underlying assets of the funds derived from inputs
    principally based on quoted market prices in an active market or
    corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other
    means.

Mortgage and asset backed securities

— Fair
    value is based on prices obtained from third party pricing
    sources. The prices from third party pricing sources may be
    based on bid quotes from dealers and recent trade data. Mortgage
    backed securities are traded in the

over-the-counter

market.

Real estate

— Real estate investments consist
    of real estate investment trusts and property funds. Real estate
    investment trusts are classified as Level 1 and are valued
    based on quoted market prices. Property funds are classified as
    either Level 2 or Level 3 depending upon whether
    liquidity is limited or there are few observable market
    participant transactions. Fair value is based on third party
    appraisals.

Limited partnerships

— Investments in limited
    partnerships are valued based upon valuations provided by the
    general partners of the funds. The values of limited
    partnerships are based upon an assessment of each underlying
    investment, incorporating valuations that consider the
    evaluation of financing and sales transactions with third
    parties, expected cash flows, and market-based information,
    including comparable transactions and performance multiples
    among other factors. The investments are classified as
    Level 3 since the valuation is determined using
    unobservable inputs.

Hedge funds

— Hedge fund investments include
    hedge funds valued based upon a net asset value derived from the
    fair value of underlying securities and are therefore classified
    as Level 2 assets. Hedge fund investments may include long
    and short positions in equity and fixed income securities,
    derivative instruments such as futures and options, commodities,
    and other types of securities.

Guaranteed insurance contracts

— These assets
    are classified as Level 3 assets as they are valued using
    unobservable inputs. Guaranteed insurance contracts are valued
    based on the discounted stream of guaranteed benefit payments at
    a market rate increased for expected future profit sharing. The
    expected excess return is equal to expected indexation granted
    to participants. The discounted stream of guaranteed benefit
    payments is calculated based on the expected mortality rates of
    plan participants.

Other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets included
    net accrued interest and dividends receivable, amounts due for
    securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased, and
    other payables.

    January 1, 2011 who will not be eligible to participate in
    the defined benefit plans and who are not covered by collective
    bargaining agreements receive a contribution equal to 3% of
    compensation regardless of their participation in the Savings
    Plan. Prior to January 1, 2011, the company provided a
    matching contribution of 60% (50% at certain locations) of the
    employee contributions up to 5% of compensation after one year
    of continued service. Amounts charged to Costs and expenses were

During 2011, the company recorded a tax benefit of $8 following
    the finalization of tax audits.

In the third quarter of 2010, the company recorded deferred tax
    expense of $10 due to the enactment of U.S. health care
    legislation in March 2010. The law changed the tax treatment of
    subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits
    to retirees. Accordingly, the company recorded the non-cash
    charge to reduce the value of the deferred tax asset associated
    with the subsidy.

In 2010, the company recorded a tax benefit of $9 following the
    finalization of tax audits. The company recorded an additional
    tax benefit of $2 during the year related to the resolution of
    other tax contingencies.

In 2009, the company recorded a tax benefit of $11 following the
    finalization of tax audits.

At July 31, 2011, U.S. and

non-U.S. subsidiaries

of the company have tax loss carryforwards of approximately
    $395. Of these carryforwards, $163 expire between 2012 and 2028,
    and $232 may be carried forward indefinitely. The current
    statutory tax rates in these countries range from 20% to 35%. At
    July 31, 2011, deferred tax asset valuation allowances have
    been established to offset $132 of these tax loss carryforwards.
    Additionally, at July 31, 2011,

non-U.S. subsidiaries

of the company have capital loss carryforwards of approximately
    $406, which are fully offset by deferred tax asset valuation
    allowances.

The net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in
    2011 was an increase of $33. The increase was primarily due to
    the impact of currency and recognition of additional valuation
    allowances on foreign loss carryforwards. The net change in the
    valuation allowance in 2010 was an increase of $15. The increase
    was primarily due to the impact of currency and the recognition
    of additional valuation allowances on foreign loss carryforwards
    that are not expected to be utilized prior to the expiration
    date. The net change in the valuation allowance in 2009 was a
    decrease of $7, primarily due to currency.

As of July 31, 2011, U.S. income taxes have not been
    provided on approximately $420 of undistributed earnings of

non-U.S. subsidiaries,

which are deemed to be permanently reinvested. It is not
    practical to estimate the tax liability that might be incurred
    if such earnings were remitted to the U.S.

As of July 31, 2011, August 1, 2010, and
    August 2, 2009, there were $17, $22, and $28, respectively,
    of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the
    annual effective tax rate. The total amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits can change due to audit settlements, tax examination
    activities, statute expirations and the


NOTES TO

recognition and measurement criteria under accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes. The company is unable to estimate
    what this change could be within the next twelve months, but
    does not believe it would be material to the financial
    statements.

The company’s accounting policy with respect to interest
    and penalties attributable to income taxes is to reflect any
    expense or benefit as a component of its income tax provision.
    The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Earnings was a benefit of $1 in 2011,
    an expense of $2 in 2010 and a benefit of $1 in 2009. The total
    amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets as of July 31, 2011, and August 1,
    2010, was $8 and $9, respectively.

None of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, including
    interest and penalties, are expected to be settled within the
    next twelve months. The $51 and $45 of unrecognized tax benefit
    liabilities, including interest and penalties, were reported as
    other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
    as of July 31, 2011, and August 1, 2010, respectively.

The company does business globally and, as a result, files
    income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and
    various state and

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

In the normal course of business, the company is subject to
    examination by taxing authorities throughout the world,
    including such major jurisdictions as the United States,
    Australia, Canada, Belgium, France and Germany. The 2011 tax
    year is currently under audit by the IRS. In addition, several
    state income tax examinations are in progress for fiscal years
    2001 to 2009.

With limited exceptions, the company has been audited for income
    tax purposes in Canada and France through fiscal year 2005, in
    Germany through fiscal year 2007, and in Belgium and Australia
    through fiscal year 2009.

In April 2011, the company issued $500 of 4.25% notes which
    mature on April 15, 2021. Interest on the notes is due
    semi-annually on April 15 and October 15, commencing on
    October 15, 2011. The company may redeem the notes in whole
    or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the
    principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed to
    ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early
    redemption.

In July 2010, the company issued $400 of 3.05% notes which
    mature on July 15, 2017. Interest on the notes is due
    semi-annually on January 15 and July 15, commencing on
    January 15, 2011. The company may redeem the notes in whole
    or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the
    principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed to
    ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early
    redemption.

The fair value of the company’s long-term debt, including
    the current portion of long-term debt in Short-term borrowings,
    was $2,603 at July 31, 2011 and $2,829 at August 1,
    2010.

Principal amounts of debt mature as follows: none in 2012; $400
    in 2013; $300 in 2014; $300 in 2015; none in 2016; and beyond a
    total of $1,400.

Financial
    Instruments

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings,
    excluding the current portion of long-term debt, approximate
    fair value. The fair value of long-term debt as indicated in
    Note 13 is based on quoted market prices or pricing models
    using current market rates.

The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and
    commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity
    price changes related to certain deferred compensation
    obligations. In order to manage these exposures, the company
    follows established risk management policies and procedures,
    including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps,
    forwards and commodity futures and option contracts. These
    derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent
    with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute
    positions independent of those exposures. The company does not
    enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and
    does not use leveraged instruments. The company’s
    derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do
    not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.


NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to
    derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual
    obligations. The company minimizes counterparty credit risk on
    these transactions by dealing only with leading, credit-worthy
    financial institutions having long-term credit ratings of
    “A” or better. In addition, the contracts are
    distributed among several financial institutions, thus
    minimizing credit-risk concentration. The company does not have
    credit-risk-related contingent features in its derivative
    instruments as of July 31, 2011.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Risk

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related
    to its international operations, including non-functional
    currency intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries.
    The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result
    of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency
    of certain subsidiaries. Principal currencies hedged include the
    Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Swedish krona, New
    Zealand dollar, British pound and Japanese yen. The company
    utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts as
    well as cross-currency swaps to hedge these exposures. The
    contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments
    or are undesignated. The company typically hedges portions of
    its forecasted foreign currency transaction exposure with
    foreign exchange forward contracts for up to 18 months. To
    hedge currency exposures related to intercompany debt, the
    company enters into cross-currency swap contracts for periods
    consistent with the underlying debt. As of July 31, 2011,
    cross-currency swap contracts mature in fiscal 2012 through
    fiscal 2015. The notional amount of foreign exchange forward and
    cross-currency swap contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges
    was $287 and $261 at July 31, 2011 and August 1, 2010,
    respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value
    on these instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income
    (loss) and is reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of
    Earnings on the same line item and same period in which the
    underlying hedge transaction affects earnings. The notional
    amount of foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap
    contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was $861
    and $757 at July 31, 2011 and August 1, 2010,
    respectively.

Interest
    Rate Risk

The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by
    optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by
    utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its

variable-to-total

debt ratio within targeted guidelines. Receive fixed rate/pay
    variable rate interest rate swaps are accounted for as
    fair-value hedges. The notional amount of outstanding fair-value
    interest rate swaps totaled $500 at July 31, 2011 and at
    August 1, 2010.

During fiscal 2010, the company entered into forward starting
    interest rate swap contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges
    with a combined notional value of $200 to hedge a July 2010
    anticipated debt offering. These swaps were settled concurrent
    with the July 2010 debt issuance of $400 seven-year
    3.05% notes at a loss of $14, which was recorded in other
    comprehensive income (loss). The loss on the swap contracts will
    be amortized over the life of the debt as additional interest
    expense.

In June 2008, the company entered into two forward starting
    interest rate swap contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges
    with a combined notional value of $200 to hedge an anticipated
    debt offering in fiscal 2009. These swaps were settled as of
    November 2, 2008, at a loss of $13, which was recorded in
    other comprehensive income (loss). In January 2009, the company
    issued $300 ten-year 4.50% notes. The loss on the swap
    contracts will be amortized over the life of the debt as
    additional interest expense.

Commodity
    Price Risk

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders
    and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in
    connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain
    commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters
    into commodity futures and options contracts to reduce the
    volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, wheat, natural
    gas, soybean oil, aluminum, sugar, cocoa, and corn, which impact
    the cost of raw materials. Commodity futures and option
    contracts are typically accounted for as cash-flow hedges or are
    not designated as accounting hedges. The company enters into
    commodity futures and option contracts to hedge a portion of
    commodity requirements for periods typically up to
    12 months. The notional amount of commodity contracts
    accounted for as cash-


NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

flow hedges was $6 at July 31, 2011 and $7 at
    August 1, 2010. The notional amount of commodity contracts
    that were not designated as accounting hedges was $81 at
    July 31, 2011 and $43 at August 1, 2010.

Equity
    Price Risk

The company hedges a portion of exposures relating to certain
    deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of
    the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the total return
    of the company’s capital stock and the total return of the
    Puritan Fund, or beginning in January 2011, the total return of
    the Vanguard International Stock Index. Under these contracts,
    the company pays variable interest rates and receives from the
    counterparty either the total return of the Standard &
    Poor’s 500 Index, the total return on company capital
    stock, the total return of the Puritan Fund, or the total return
    of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index, which is expected to approximate
    the total return of the Vanguard International Index. The
    contracts related to the Puritan Fund matured in January 2011.
    The contracts were not designated as hedges for accounting
    purposes and are typically entered into for periods not
    exceeding 12 months. The notional amounts of the contracts
    were $71 as of July 31, 2011 and $75 as of August 1,
    2010.

Fair
    Value Measurements

The company is required to categorize financial assets and
    liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy:

•

Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices
    (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active
    markets.

•

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in
    Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
    through corroboration with observable market data.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting
    entity’s own assumptions.

Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that
    would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    as of the measurement date. When available, the company uses
    unadjusted quoted market prices to measure the fair value and
    classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices
    are not available, the company bases fair value upon internally
    developed models that use current market-based or independently
    sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency
    rates.

Financial
    Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a

The following table presents the company’s financial assets

Items Measured
    at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

In addition to assets and liabilities measured at fair value on
    a recurring basis, the company is required to measure certain
    assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, generally as a
    result of an impairment charge. In 2011, as part of the
    company’s annual review of intangible assets, an impairment
    charge of $3 was recognized related to the

Heisse Tasse

trademark used in the International Simple Meals and
    Beverages segment. The fair value of the trademark was $11 at
    July 31, 2011 based on Level 3 inputs. Fair value was
    determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include
    significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates,
    weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates.

Shareowners’
    Equity

The company has authorized 560 million shares of Capital
    stock with $.0375 par value and 40 million shares of
    Preferred stock, issuable in one or more classes, with or
    without par as may be authorized by the Board of Directors. No
    Preferred stock has been issued.

Share
    Repurchase Programs

In June 2008, the company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the purchase of up to $1,200 of company stock through fiscal
    2011. This program began in fiscal 2009 and was completed in
    fiscal 2011. In June 2011, the Board authorized the purchase of
    up to $1,000 of company stock. This program has no expiration
    date. In addition to these publicly announced programs, the
    company repurchases shares to offset the impact of dilution from
    shares issued under the company’s stock compensation plans.

In 2011, the company repurchased 21 million shares at a
    cost of $728. Of the 2011 repurchases, approximately
    16 million shares at a cost of $550 were made pursuant to

    program, which was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2011.

In 2010, the company repurchased 14 million shares at a
    cost of $472. Of the 2010 repurchases, approximately
    7 million shares at a cost of $250 were made pursuant to
    the company’s June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase
    program.

In 2009, the company repurchased 17 million shares at a
    cost of $527. Of the 2009 repurchases, approximately

Stock-Based
    Compensation

In 2003, shareowners approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan,
    which authorized the issuance of 28 million shares to
    satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
    unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including
    performance restricted stock) and performance units.
    Approximately 3.2 million shares available under a previous
    long-term plan were rolled into the 2003 Long-Term Incentive
    Plan, making the total number of available shares approximately
    31.2 million. In November 2005, shareowners approved the
    2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of
    an additional 6 million shares to satisfy the same types of
    awards.

Awards under the 2003 and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans may be
    granted to employees and directors. The term of a stock option
    granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date
    of grant. Options granted


NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

under these plans vest cumulatively over a three-year period at
    a rate of 30%, 60% and 100%, respectively. The option price may
    not be less than the fair market value of a share of common
    stock on the date of the grant.

Pursuant to the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, in July 2005 the
    company adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which
    provides for grants of total shareowner return (TSR) performance
    restricted

stock/units,

EPS performance restricted stock/units, and time-lapse
    restricted stock/units. Initial grants made in accordance with
    this program were approved in September 2005. Under the program,
    awards of TSR performance restricted stock/units will be earned
    by comparing the company’s total shareowner return during a
    three-year period to the respective total shareowner returns of
    companies in a performance peer group. Based upon the
    company’s ranking in the performance peer group, a
    recipient of TSR performance restricted stock/units may earn a
    total award ranging from 0% to 225% of the initial grant. Awards
    of EPS performance restricted stock/units will be earned based
    upon the company’s achievement of annual earnings per share
    goals. During the three-year vesting period, a recipient of EPS
    performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award
    ranging from 0% to 100% of the initial grant. Awards of
    time-lapse restricted stock/units will vest ratably over the
    three-year period. In addition, the company may issue special
    grants of time-lapse restricted stock/units to attract and
    retain executives which vest ratably over various periods.
    Awards are generally granted annually in October. Annual stock
    option grants are not part of the long-term incentive
    compensation program for 2009, 2010, and 2011. However, stock
    options may still be granted on a selective basis under the 2003
    and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans.

Total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense recognized in
    Earnings from continuing operations was $87 for 2011, $88 for
    2010, and $84 for 2009. Tax related benefits of $32 were
    recognized for 2011, $33 were recognized for 2010 and $31 were
    recognized for 2009.

    January 2009, compensation related to stock options was fully
    expensed. The company measured the fair value of stock options
    using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The fair value of time-lapse restricted stock/units and EPS
    performance restricted stock/units is determined based on the
    number of shares granted and the quoted price of the
    company’s stock at the date of grant. Time-lapse restricted
    stock/units are expensed on a straight-line basis over the
    vesting period, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible
    participants, which are expensed on an accelerated basis. EPS
    performance restricted stock/units are expensed on a
    graded-vesting basis, except for awards issued to
    retirement-eligible participants, which are expensed on an
    accelerated basis.

On July 1, 2011, the company issued approximately 400,000
    special retention time-lapse restricted stock units to certain
    executives to support the successful execution of the
    company’s shift in strategic direction and leadership
    transition. The awards vest over a two-year period. The
    grant-date fair value was $34.65 and is included in the table
    above.

As of July 31, 2011, total remaining unearned compensation
    related to nonvested time-lapse restricted stock/units and EPS
    performance restricted stock/units was $46, which will be
    amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of
    1.7 years. The fair value of restricted stock/units vested
    during 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $40, $32, and $47, respectively.
    The weighted-average grant-date fair value of restricted
    stock/units granted during 2010 and 2009 was $32.25 and $39.50,

Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the service period. As of July 31, 2011, total remaining
    unearned compensation related to TSR performance restricted
    stock/units was $53, which will be amortized over the
    weighted-average remaining service period of 1.7 years. In
    the first quarter of fiscal 2011, recipients of TSR performance
    restricted stock/units earned 100% of their initial grants based
    upon the company’s TSR ranking in a performance peer group
    during a three-year period ended July 30, 2010. The total
    fair value of TSR performance restricted stock/units vested
    during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $38, $31 and $58, respectively.
    The grant-date fair value of TSR performance restricted
    stock/units granted during 2010 and 2009 was $33.84 and $47.20,
    respectively. In the first quarter of 2012, recipients of TSR
    performance restricted stock/units will receive 0% of the
    initial grant based upon the company’s TSR ranking in a
    performance peer group during the three-year period ended
    July 31, 2011.

Prior to fiscal 2009, employees could elect to defer all types
    of restricted stock awards. These awards were classified as
    liabilities because of the possibility that they may be settled
    in cash. The fair value was adjusted quarterly. As of October
    2010, these awards were fully vested. The total cash paid to
    settle the liabilities in 2011, 2010, and 2009 was not material.

The excess tax benefits on the exercise of stock options and
    vested restricted stock presented as cash flows from financing
    activities were $11 in 2011 and 2010 and $18 in 2009. Cash
    received from the exercise of stock options was $96, $139, and
    $72, for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, and is reflected in
    cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

The company is a party to legal proceedings and claims arising
    out of the normal course of business.

Management assesses the probability of loss for all legal
    proceedings and claims and has recognized liabilities for such
    contingencies, as appropriate. Although the results of these
    matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in management’s
    opinion, the final outcome of legal proceedings and claims will
    not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results
    of operations or financial condition of the company.

The company has certain operating lease commitments, primarily
    related to warehouse and office facilities, retail store space
    and certain equipment. Rent expense under operating lease
    commitments was $50 in 2011, $48 in 2010, and $47 in 2009.
    Future minimum annual rental payments under these operating
    leases are as follows:

The company guarantees approximately 2,000 bank loans made to
    Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party
    financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes.
    The maximum potential amount of future payments the company
    could be required to make under the guarantees is $162. The
    company’s guarantees are indirectly secured by the
    distribution routes. The company does not believe it is probable
    that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result
    of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. The amounts recognized
    as of July 31, 2011 and August 1, 2010 were not
    material.

In connection with the sale of certain Australian salty snack
    food brands and assets, the company agreed to provide a loan
    facility to the buyer of AUD $10, or approximately USD $10. The
    facility was drawn down in AUD $5 increments in 2009. Borrowings
    under the facility are to be repaid in 2013.

The company has provided certain standard indemnifications in
    connection with divestitures, contracts and other transactions.
    Certain indemnifications have finite expiration dates.
    Liabilities recognized based on known exposures related to such
    matters were not material at July 31, 2011.

The deferred compensation obligation represents unfunded plans
    maintained for the purpose of providing the company’s
    directors and certain of its executives the opportunity to defer
    a portion of their compensation. All forms of compensation
    contributed to the deferred compensation plans are accounted for
    in accordance with the underlying program. Deferrals and company
    contributions are credited to an investment account in the
    participant’s name, although no funds are actually
    contributed to the investment account and no investments are
    actually purchased. Six investment choices are available,
    including: (1) a book account that tracks the total return
    on company stock; (2) a book account that tracks the
    performance of the Vanguard Institutional Index; (3) a book
    account that tracks the performance of the Vanguard Extended
    Market Index; (4) a book account that tracks the
    performance of the Vanguard Total International Stock Fund;
    (5) a book account that tracks the performance of the
    Vanguard Total Bond Market Index; and (6) a book account
    that tracks the performance of Charles Schwab Stable Value Fund.
    Participants can reallocate investments daily and are entitled
    to the gains and losses on investment funds. The company
    recognizes an amount in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings
    for the market appreciation/depreciation of each fund.

Management’s
    Report on Financial Statements

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the
    company’s management in conformity with generally accepted
    accounting principles to reflect the financial position of the
    company and its operating results. The financial information
    appearing throughout this Annual Report is consistent with the
    financial statements. Management is responsible for the
    information and representations in such financial statements,
    including the estimates and judgments required for their
    preparation. The financial statements have been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
    entirely of Directors who are not officers or employees of the
    company, meets regularly with the company’s worldwide
    internal auditing department, other management personnel, and
    the independent registered public accounting firm. The
    independent registered public accounting firm and the internal
    auditing department have had, and continue to have, direct
    access to the Audit Committee without the presence of other
    management personnel, and have been directed to discuss the
    results of their audit work and any matters they believe should
    be brought to the Committee’s attention. The internal
    auditing department and the independent registered public
    accounting firm report directly to the Audit Committee.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America.

The company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    Directors of the company; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
    the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
    the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    July 31, 2011. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on this
    assessment using those criteria, management concluded that the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of July 31, 2011.


The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of July 31, 2011 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareowners and Directors of Campbell Soup Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of earnings, of equity, and
    of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of Campbell Soup Company and its subsidiaries
    at July 31, 2011 and August 1, 2010, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    fiscal years in the period ended July 31, 2011 in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
    financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
    Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects,
    the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
    the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    July 31, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these
    financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for unvested share-based payment awards that contain
    non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents in
    the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class
    method in 2010.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Column (a) represents stock options and restricted stock
    units outstanding under the 2005 Long-Term Plan, the 2003
    Long-Term Plan and the 1994 Long-Term Plan. No additional awards
    can be made under the 1994 Long-Term Plan. Future equity awards
    under the 2005 Long-Term Plan and the 2003 Long-Term Plan may
    take the form of stock options, SARs, performance unit awards,
    restricted stock, restricted performance stock, restricted stock
    units or stock awards. Column (b) represents the
    weighted-average exercise price of the outstanding stock options
    only; the outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock
    units are not included in this calculation. Column
    (c) represents the maximum aggregate number of future
    equity awards that can be made under the 2005 Long-Term Plan and
    the 2003 Long-Term Plan as of July 31, 2011. The maximum
    number of future equity awards that can be made under the 2005
    Long-Term Plan as of July 31, 2011 is 10,500,021. The
    maximum number of future equity awards that can be made under
    the 2003 Long-Term Plan as of July 31, 2011 is 1,599,111
    (the 2003 Plan Limit). Each stock option or SAR awarded under
    the 2003 Long-Term Plan reduces the 2003 Plan Limit by one
    share. Each restricted stock unit, restricted stock, restricted
    performance stock unit, restricted performance stock or stock
    award under the 2003 Long-Term Plan reduces the 2003 Plan Limit
    by four shares. In the event any award (or portion thereof)
    under the 1994 Long-Term Plan lapses, expires or is otherwise
    terminated without the issuance of any company stock or is
    settled by delivery of consideration other than company stock,
    the maximum number of future equity awards that can be made
    under the 2003 Long-Term Plan automatically increases by the
    number of such shares.
