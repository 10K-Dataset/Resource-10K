CAMPBELL SOUP COMPANY

FORM 10-K




PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

The Company

Campbell Soup Company (“Campbell” or the “company”), together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, is a global manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food
products. Campbell was incorporated as a business corporation under the laws of New Jersey on
November 23, 1922; however, through predecessor organizations, it traces its heritage in the food
business back to 1869. The company’s principal executive offices are in Camden, New Jersey
08103-1799.

In fiscal 2007, the company continued its focus on achieving long-term sustainable quality growth
through executing five key strategies to drive success in both the marketplace and the workplace.
The five strategies include:

Consistent with these strategies, the company has undertaken several portfolio adjustments. The
company divested its United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to Premier Foods plc on August 15,
2006. Likewise, in June 2007, the company completed the sale of its ownership interest in Papua
New Guinea operations. Most recently, on August 9, 2007, the company announced that it is
exploring strategic alternatives, including possible divestiture, for its Godiva Chocolatier
business. These portfolio adjustments are intended to better focus Campbell on optimizing its
long-term growth potential by leveraging the competitive advantages of its simple meals, baked
snacks, and vegetable-based beverages businesses in markets with the greatest potential for
growth.

The company’s operations are organized and reported in the following segments: U.S. Soup, Sauces
and Beverages; Baking and Snacking; International Soup and Sauces; and Other. The segments are
discussed in greater detail below.

U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages

The U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment includes the following
retail businesses:

Campbell’s

condensed and ready-to-serve soups;

Swanson

broth and canned
poultry;

Prego

pasta sauce;

Pace

Mexican sauce;

Campbell’s Chunky

chili;

Campbell’s

canned pasta,
gravies and beans;

Campbell’s Supper Bakes

meal kits;

V8

juice and juice drinks; and

Campbell’s

tomato juice.

Baking and Snacking

The
Baking and Snacking segment includes the following businesses:

Pepperidge Farm

cookies, crackers, bakery and frozen products in U.S. retail;

Arnott’s

biscuits in
Australia and Asia Pacific; and

Arnott’s

salty snacks in Australia. As previously discussed, in
June 2007, the company completed the sale of its ownership interest in Papua New Guinea
operations, which were historically included in this segment.

International Soup and
Sauces

The International Soup and Sauces segment includes the soup, sauce
and beverage businesses outside of the United States, including Europe, Mexico, Latin America, the
Asia Pacific region and the retail business in Canada. The segment’s operations include

Erasco

and

Heisse Tasse

soups in Germany,

Liebig

and

Royco

soups and

Lesieur

sauces in France,

Devos Lemmens

mayonnaise and cold sauces and

Campbell’s

and

Royco

soups in Belgium, and

Blå Band

soups and sauces
in Sweden. In Asia Pacific, operations include

Campbell’s

soup and stock,

Swanson

broths and

V8

beverages. In Canada, operations include

Habitant

and

Campbell’s

soups,

Prego

pasta sauce and

V8

beverages. As previously discussed, on August 15, 2006, the company completed the sale of its
United Kingdom and Ireland businesses, which included

Homepride

sauces,

OXO

stock cubes, and

Batchelors, McDonnells

and

Erin

soups. The results of these divested businesses have been reflected
as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Other

The balance of the portfolio reported in Other includes Godiva Chocolatier worldwide and the
company’s Away From Home operations, which represent the distribution of products such as soup,
specialty entrees, beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm products through
various food service channels in the United States and Canada. As previously discussed, the
company is exploring strategic alternatives, including possible divestiture, for its Godiva
Chocolatier business.

Ingredients

The ingredients required for the manufacture of the company’s food products are
purchased from various suppliers. While all such ingredients are available from numerous
independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number
of factors, including changes in crop size, cattle cycles, product scarcity, demand
for raw materials, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements and
weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons. To help reduce some of this
volatility, the company uses commodity futures contracts for a number of its ingredients and
commodities, such as corn, cocoa, soybean meal, soybean oil, wheat, dairy and natural gas.
Ingredient inventories are at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and
spring. Since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only at
certain seasons, the company



makes commitments for the purchase of such ingredients during their respective seasons. At
this time, the company does not anticipate any material restrictions on availability or shortages
of ingredients that would have a significant impact on the company’s businesses. For additional
information on the impact of inflation on the company, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”

Customers

In most of the company’s markets, sales activities are conducted by the company’s own
sales force and through broker and distributor arrangements. In the United States, Canada and Latin
America, the company’s products are generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass
discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores, drug stores and other retail,
commercial and non-commercial establishments. In Europe, the company’s products are generally
resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass discounters and other retail establishments. In
Mexico, the company’s products are generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, club
stores, convenience stores and other retail establishments. In the Asia Pacific region, the
company’s products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains, convenience stores
and other retail establishments. Godiva Chocolatier’s products are sold generally through a network
of company-owned retail boutiques in North America, Europe, and Asia, franchised third-party retail
boutique operators primarily in Europe, third-party distributors in Europe and Asia, and major
retailers, including department stores and duty-free shops, worldwide. Godiva Chocolatier’s
products are also sold through catalogs and on the Internet, although these sales are primarily
limited to North America and Japan. The company makes shipments promptly after receipt and
acceptance of orders.

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for
approximately 15% of the company’s consolidated net sales during fiscal 2007 and 14% during fiscal
2006. All of the company’s segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates. No
other customer accounted for 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net sales.

Trademarks And Technology

As of September 17, 2007, the company owns over 5,400 trademark
registrations and applications in over 150 countries and believes that its trademarks are of
material importance to its business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally
are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and have
not been found to have become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be renewed
indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. The company believes that its principal brands,
including

Campbell’s, Erasco, Liebig, Pepperidge Farm, V8, Pace, Prego, Swanson,

Arnott’s,

and

Godiva,

are protected by trademark law in the company’s relevant major markets.
In addition, some of the company’s products are sold under brands that have been licensed from
third parties.

Although the company owns a number of valuable patents, it does not regard any segment of its
business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, the
company owns copyrights, both registered and unregistered, and proprietary trade secrets,
technology, know-how processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Competition

The company experiences worldwide competition in all of its principal products. This
competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes, including producers of generic and
private label products, as well as from manufacturers of other branded food products, which
compete for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. As such, the number of competitors
cannot be reliably estimated. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, quality,
price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service.

Working Capital

For information relating to the company’s cash and working capital items, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”

Capital Expenditures

During fiscal 2007, the company’s aggregate capital expenditures were $334
million. The company expects to spend approximately $400 million for capital projects in fiscal
2008. The anticipated major fiscal 2008 capital projects include the previously announced
expansion and enhancement of the company’s corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, which is
expected to continue into fiscal years following 2008, and expansion of the company’s beverage
production capacity.

Research And Development

During the last three fiscal years, the company’s expenditures on research
activities relating to new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing products for
continuing operations were $112 million in 2007, $104 million in 2006 and $93 million in 2005. The
increase from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to expenses related to new
product development, higher incentive compensation costs and the impact of currency. The increase
from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense recognized under
SFAS No. 123R, higher compensation and benefit expenses and expenses related to new product
development. The company conducts this research primarily at its headquarters in Camden, New
Jersey, although important research is undertaken at various other locations inside and outside the
United States.



Environmental Matters

The company has requirements for the operation and design of its facilities
that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations. Of the company’s $334 million
in capital expenditures made during fiscal 2007, approximately $6 million was for compliance with
environmental laws and regulations in the United States. The company further estimates that
approximately $11 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during fiscal 2008 will be for
compliance with such environmental laws and regulations. The company believes that continued
compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on
capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the company.

Seasonality

Demand for the company’s products is somewhat seasonal, with the fall and winter
months usually accounting for the highest sales volume due primarily to demand for the company’s
soup and sauce products. Godiva Chocolatier sales are also strongest during the fall and winter
months. Demand for the company’s beverage, baking and snacking products, however, is generally
evenly distributed throughout the year.

Regulation

The manufacture and marketing of food products is highly regulated. In the United
States, the company is subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food
and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Federal Trade Commission, as
well as various state and local agencies. The company is also regulated by similar agencies
outside the United States and by voluntary organizations such as the National Advertising Division
and the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative of the Council of Better Business
Bureaus.

Employees

On July 29, 2007, there were approximately 22,500 employees of the company.

Financial Information

identifiable assets attributable to the company’s business segments and geographic areas, see Note
6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and
uncertainties could materially adversely affect the company’s business, financial condition and
results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or
that the company currently deems immaterial also may impair the company’s business operations and
financial condition.

The company operates in a highly competitive industry

The company operates in the highly
competitive food industry and experiences worldwide competition in all of its principal products. A
number of the company’s primary competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other
resources. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to the company’s
marketplace efforts could result in the company reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other
expenditures, or losing market share. These changes may have a material adverse effect on the
business and financial results of the company.

The company’s long-term results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives

The company’s
long-term results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives. The company’s product
introductions and product improvements, along with its other marketplace initiatives, are designed
to capitalize on new customer or consumer trends. In order to remain successful, the company must
anticipate and react to these new trends and develop new products or processes to address them.
While the company devotes significant resources to meeting this goal, the company may not be
successful in developing new products or processes, or its new products or processes may not be
accepted by customers or consumers. These results could have a material adverse effect on the
business and financial results of the company.

The company may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, its
ongoing supply chain, information technology or other initiatives

The company’s success is partly
dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, its ongoing
supply chain, information technology and other initiatives. These initiatives are primarily
designed to make the company more efficient in the manufacture and distribution of its products,
which is necessary in the company’s highly competitive industry. These initiatives are often
complex, and a failure to implement
them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an
interruption to the company’s sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service or accounting
functions. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial
results of the company.



The company may be adversely impacted by the increased significance of some of its customers

The
disruption of supply to any of the company’s large customers, such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., for
an extended period of time could adversely affect the company’s business or financial results. In
addition, the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate, and mass market retailers continue to
become larger. In such an environment, a large retail customer may attempt to increase its
profitability by lowering the prices of its suppliers or increasing promotional programs funded by
its suppliers. If the company is unable to use its scale, marketing expertise, product innovation
and category leadership positions to respond to these customer demands, the company’s business or
financial results could be negatively impacted.

The company’s long-term results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and
packaging materials

The raw and packaging materials used in the company’s business include tomato
paste, beef, poultry, vegetables, metal containers, glass, paper, resin and energy. Many of these
materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including product scarcity,
demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, currency fluctuations, weather conditions,
import and export requirements and changes in government-sponsored agricultural programs. To the
extent any of these factors result in an unforeseen increase in raw and packaging material prices,
the company may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases. In
such case, the company’s business or financial results could be negatively impacted.

The
company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or failure of,
its information technology systems

Each year the company engages in several billion dollars of transactions with
its customers and vendors. Because the amount of dollars involved is so significant, the company’s
information technology resources must provide connections among its marketing, sales,
manufacturing, logistics, customer service and accounting functions. If the company does not
allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and
sustain an appropriate technology
infrastructure and to maintain the related computerized and manual control processes, the company’s
business or financial results could be negatively impacted.

Disruption to the company’s supply chain could adversely affect its business

Damage or disruption
to the company’s suppliers or to the company’s manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to
weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes or other reasons could impair the
company’s ability to manufacture and/or sell its products. Failure to take adequate steps to
mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if
they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location, could adversely affect
the company’s business or financial results.

The company may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and
divestitures

From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. The success of
any such acquisition or divestiture depends, in part, upon the company’s ability to identify
suitable buyers or sellers, negotiate favorable contractual terms and, in many cases, obtain
governmental approval. For acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the
acquired business into the company’s existing operations. In cases where acquisitions or
divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, the company’s business or financial
results could be negatively impacted.

The company’s long-term results may be impacted negatively by political and/or economic conditions
in the United States or other nations

The company is a global manufacturer and marketer of
high-quality, branded convenience food products. Because of its global reach, the company’s
performance may be impacted negatively by political and/or economic conditions in the United
States, as well as other nations. A change in any one or more of the following factors in the
United States, or in other nations, could impact the company: currency exchange rates, tax rates,
interest rates, legal or regulatory requirements, tariffs, export and import restrictions or equity
markets. The company may also be impacted by recession, political instability, civil disobedience,
armed hostilities, natural disasters and terrorist acts in the United States or throughout the
world. Any one of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial
results of the company.

If the company’s food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, the company might need to
recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured

The company
may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or if they are mis-labeled. The
company may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury. A widespread
product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of
product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. The
company could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against it. A
significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage
to the company’s reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the company’s food products, which
could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial results of the company.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

(ii) 46,245 shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on

Average price paid per share is calculated on a settlement basis and excludes commission.


During fiscal 2007, the company had two publicly announced share repurchase programs. Under
the first program, which was announced on November 21, 2005, the company’s Board of Directors
authorized the purchase of up to $600 million of company capital stock on the open market or
through privately negotiated transactions through the end of fiscal 2008. Under the second
program, which was announced on August 15, 2006, the company’s Board of Directors authorized
the purchase of up to an additional $620 million of company capital stock in fiscal 2007. The
August 2006 program terminated at the end of fiscal 2007. Pursuant to the share repurchase
programs, the company entered into two accelerated share repurchase agreements on September
28, 2006 with a financial institution to repurchase approximately $600 million of common
stock. Under the first agreement, the company purchased approximately 8.3 million shares of
its common stock for $300 million, or $35.95 per share, subject to a purchase price adjustment
payable upon settlement of the agreement. The first agreement settled on July 5, 2007, and the
company paid a $22 million purchase price adjustment on that date. This $22 million has been
recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital and reduced from the dollar value of
shares that may yet be purchased under the company’s repurchase programs. Under the second
agreement, the company purchased approximately $300 million of its common stock. Pursuant to
the second agreement, 6.3 million shares were delivered at $35.95 per share on September 29,
2006, and an additional 1.3 million shares were delivered at $36.72 per share on October 25,
2006. The value of the shares delivered in September and October 2006 was approximately $273
million. The second agreement settled on July 5, 2007, and the company received an additional
approximate 200,000 shares valued at approximately $9 million, for a total delivery of 7.8
million shares valued at approximately $280 million. The remaining approximately $20 million
paid pursuant to the second agreement has been recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in
capital and reduced from the dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the
company’s repurchase programs. For additional information on the accelerated share repurchase
agreements, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to the November
2005 program, the company will continue to purchase shares, under separate authorization, as
part of its practice of buying back shares sufficient to offset shares issued under incentive
compensation plans.


Includes (i) 600,508 shares repurchased in open-market transactions at an average price of
$39.32 to offset the dilutive impact to existing shareowners of issuances under the company’s
stock compensation plans, and (ii) 16,352 shares owned and tendered by employees at an average
price per share of $39.00 to satisfy tax withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted
shares.


Includes (i) 1,017,400 shares repurchased in open-market transactions at an average price of
$39.19 to offset the dilutive impact to existing shareowners of issuances under the company’s

Certain
liabilities related to investments in affordable housing partnerships
were reclassified in prior year financial statements to conform to
the current-year presentation. Accordingly, assets were reduced by
$125 in 2006, $98 in 2005, $66 in 2004 and $20 in 2003.

As of August 1, 2005, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004) “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R). Under SFAS No. 123R, compensation expense is
to be recognized for all stock-based awards, including stock options. Had all stock-based
compensation been expensed in 2005, earnings from continuing operations would have been $616 and
earnings per share would have been $1.49. Net earnings would have been $678 and earnings per share
would have been $1.64. The pro forma reduction on earnings from continuing operations in prior
years would have been as follows: 2004—$28 or $.07 per share; 2003—$24 or $.06 per share.


The 2007 earnings from continuing operations were impacted by the following: a $14 ($.04 per
share) gain from the sale of an idle manufacturing facility; a $25 ($.06 per share) benefit
from a tax settlement of bilateral advance pricing agreements; and a $13 ($.03 per share)
benefit from the reversal of legal reserves due to favorable results in litigation. The 2007
results of discontinued operations included a $24 ($.06 per share) gain from the sale of the
businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland and $7 ($.02 per share) tax benefit from the
resolution of audits in the United Kingdom. On July 29, 2007, the company adopted SFAS No. 158
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).” As a result, total assets were
reduced by $294, shareowners’ equity was reduced by $230, and total liabilities were reduced
by $64.


The 2006 earnings from continuing operations were impacted by the following: a $60 ($.14 per
share) benefit from the favorable resolution of a U.S. tax contingency; an $8 ($.02 per share)
benefit from a change in inventory accounting method; incremental tax expense of $13 ($.03 per
share) associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings under the American Jobs Creation
Act; and a $14 ($.03 per share) tax benefit related to higher levels of foreign tax credits,
which could be utilized as a result of the sale of the businesses in the United Kingdom and
Ireland. The 2006 results of discontinued operations included $56 of deferred tax expense due
to book/tax basis differences and $5 of after-tax costs associated with the sale of the
businesses (aggregate impact of $.15 per share).


2004 earnings from continuing operations included a pre-tax restructuring charge of $26
($18 after tax or $.04 per share) related to a reduction in workforce and the
implementation of a distribution and logistics realignment in Australia. Earnings from
discontinued operations included an after-tax effect of $4 ($.01 per share) associated with
a reduction in workforce.


The 2003 fiscal year consisted of fifty-three weeks compared to fifty-two weeks in all other
periods. The additional week contributed approximately $.02 per share to net earnings.

Five-Year Review should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Campbell Soup Company is a global manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded
convenience food products. The company is focused on achieving long-term sustainable quality
growth through executing five key strategies to drive success in both the marketplace and the
workplace as follows:

The company intends to meet financial and business goals while continuing to invest in innovation,
in information systems and in emerging markets.

On August 15, 2006, the company completed the sale of its
businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland for £460 million, or approximately $870 million,
pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated July 12, 2006. The United Kingdom and Ireland
businesses included

Homepride

sauces,

OXO

stock cubes,

Batchelors

soups and

McDonnells

and

Erin

soups. The purchase price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in an
additional $19 million of proceeds. The company has reflected the results of these businesses as
discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. The
assets and liabilities of these businesses were reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued
operations held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of July 30, 2006. The company used
approximately $620 million of the net proceeds to purchase company stock. See Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In June 2007, the company completed the sale of its ownership interest in Papua New Guinea
operations for approximately $23 million. This business had annual sales of approximately $20
million.

On August 9, 2007, the company announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives, including
possible divestiture, for its Godiva Chocolatier business.

The company is organized and reports
operating results as follows: U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages, Baking and Snacking and
International Soup and Sauces, with the balance of the portfolio, which includes Godiva
Chocolatier worldwide and the Away From Home operations, reported as Other. See also Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on segments.

Results of Operations


Earnings from continuing operations were $823 million ($2.08 per share) in 2007 and $755
million ($1.82 per share) in 2006. (All earnings per share amounts included in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis are presented on a diluted basis.)

There were several items that impacted the comparability of Earnings from continuing operations and
Earnings per share from continuing operations:



•

In 2006, incremental tax expense of $13 million ($.03 per share) was recognized associated
with incremental dividends of $294 million as the company finalized its plan to repatriate earnings
from non-U.S. subsidiaries under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the AJCA); and

•

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $14 million ($.03
per share) from the anticipated use of higher levels of foreign tax credits, which could be
utilized as a result of the sale of the company’s United Kingdom and Ireland businesses in August
2006.

The sum of the individual per share amounts does not equal due to rounding.

In addition, the comparability of Earnings per share from continuing operations was impacted by the
use of proceeds from the sale of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses in the first quarter of
2007. During the first quarter of 2007, the company completed its previously announced program
utilizing $620 million of the net proceeds to repurchase shares. The pro forma impact on 2006 of
utilizing those proceeds to repurchase 17 million shares (based on the average stock price in the
first quarter) and reduce shares outstanding in the calculation of Earnings per share from
continuing operations would have resulted in a $.07 increase in Earnings per share from continuing
operations.

The remaining increase in Earnings from continuing operations in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due
to an increase in sales, a higher gross margin as a percentage of sales, and lower net interest
expense, partially offset by increased marketing expenses and a higher effective tax rate.


Earnings from continuing operations were $755 million ($1.82 per share) in 2006 and $644
million ($1.56 per share) in 2005.

In addition to the 2006 items that impacted the comparability of Earnings from continuing
operations, as of August 1, 2005, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 (revised 2004) “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R). Under SFAS No. 123R, compensation
expense is to be recognized for all stock-based awards, including stock options. Had all
stock-based compensation been expensed in 2005, Earnings from continuing operations would have been
$616 million and Earnings per share from continuing operations would have been $1.49. (See Notes 1
and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The remaining improvement in earnings from 2005 to 2006 was due to an increase in sales, an
improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales, a lower effective tax rate, and higher
interest income, partially offset by higher administrative and marketing and selling costs.

In 2007, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased 7%. U.S. soup sales increased 5% as
condensed soup sales increased 3%, ready-to-serve soup sales increased 5% and broth sales
increased 12%. The introduction in 2007 of new lower sodium varieties of condensed and
ready-to-serve soups contributed to the sales growth. Within condensed soup, both eating and
cooking varieties delivered solid sales gains. Sales growth in ready-to-serve was driven by gains
in

Campbell’s Chunky

and

Campbell’s Select

soups which benefited from higher levels of
advertising. In the convenience platform, which includes soups in microwavable bowls and cups,
sales grew double digits.

Swanson

broth sales grew due to increased advertising and continued
growth of aseptically-packaged products. Beverage sales grew significantly as

V8

vegetable juice
and

V8 V-Fusion

vegetable and fruit juice, introduced in the second quarter of 2006, responded
favorably to new advertising campaigns and increased levels of advertising.

V8 Splash

juice
drinks also experienced sales growth. Sales of

Prego

pasta sauces and

Pace

Mexican sauces
increased.

In 2006, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased 5%. U.S. soup sales increased 4% as
condensed soup sales increased 5%, ready-to-serve soup sales increased 1% and broth sales
increased 11%. The U.S. Soup sales growth was primarily driven by higher prices across the
portfolio. Condensed soup also benefited from the additional installation of gravity-feed
shelving systems and increased advertising. The ready-to-serve sales performance was positively
impacted by the introductions of

Campbell’s Select Gold Label

soups in aseptic packaging and

Campbell’s

Chicken Noodle, Tomato and Vegetable soups in microwavable bowls, which were

partially
offset by the discontinuance of

Campbell’s Kitchen Classics

soups and a decline in

Campbell’s
Chunky

soups. The introduction of

Campbell’s

Chicken Noodle, Tomato and Vegetable soups in
microwavable bowls, combined with sales gains from

Campbell’s Chunky

and

Campbell’s Select

soups
in microwavable bowls and

Campbell’s Soup at Hand

sippable soups, drove significant growth in the
convenience platform.

Swanson

broth sales growth was primarily due to volume gains of
aseptically-packaged products and successful holiday merchandising. In other parts of the
business,

Prego

pasta sauces and

Pace

Mexican sauces delivered solid sales growth. Beverage sales
increased double digits driven by

V8

vegetable juices, which had strong volume growth. The
introduction of

V8 V-Fusion

juice beverages also contributed to sales growth, while sales of

V8
Splash

juice beverages declined.

In 2007, Baking and Snacking sales increased 6%. Pepperidge Farm sales increased primarily as a
result of gains in the bakery and cookies and crackers businesses. The bakery business sales
growth was driven by gains in

Pepperidge Farm

whole grain breads and sandwich rolls. The cookies
and crackers sales growth was primarily due to

Pepperidge Farm Goldfish

snack crackers, partially
offset by a decline in cookies. Arnott’s sales increased, primarily due to the favorable impact of
currency and strong branded biscuits sales performance, partially offset by volume declines in the
Australian snack foods business.

In 2006, Baking and Snacking sales were flat versus 2005 as growth at Pepperidge Farm was offset by
declines in the Arnott’s business. Pepperidge Farm reported sales increases in its bakery and
cookies and crackers businesses. Sales of bakery products increased due to the strong performance
of

Pepperidge Farm

whole grain breads. Sales gains in cookies and crackers were primarily due to
double-digit growth of

Pepperidge Farm Goldfish

snack crackers. Arnott’s sales declined, primarily
due to a decline in the Australian snack foods business and the unfavorable impact of currency.

International Soup and Sauces sales increased 11% in 2007 versus 2006. In Europe, sales increased
primarily due to the
favorable impact of currency and strong wet soup growth in France, Germany and Belgium. In Canada,
sales increased due to growth in soup and the favorable impact of currency.

International Soup and Sauces sales increased 2% in 2006 versus 2005. In Canada, sales increased
due to the favorable impact of currency and a strong performance in ready-to-serve soup, which grew
double digits, aided by the introduction of

Campbell’s Soup at Hand

sippable soups. Sales from the
Australian soup business increased double digits, primarily due to the performance of
ready-to-serve soup and broth. In Europe, sales declined primarily due to currency. Excluding the
impact of currency, sales in Europe grew slightly driven by the business in Belgium and higher
sales of

V8

vegetable juice.



In Other, sales increased 4% in 2007 versus 2006. Godiva Chocolatier sales increased primarily due
to growth in Asia and North America. Away From Home sales increased primarily due to strong growth
of frozen soups and beverages.

In Other, sales increased 8% in 2006 versus 2005. Godiva Chocolatier sales increased primarily due
to same-store sales growth in all regions, new product introductions in the U.S., an increase in
duty-free sales in Europe and new stores in Asia. Away From Home sales increased primarily due to
sales growth in soup, including refrigerated soups, and beverages.

Gross Profit

Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, increased by $226
million in 2007 from 2006 and $177 million in 2006 from 2005. As a percent of sales, gross profit
was 41.9% in 2007, 41.8% in 2006 and 40.9% in 2005. The percentage point increase in 2007 was due
to productivity improvements (approximately 1.9 percentage points), higher selling prices
(approximately 1.2 percentage points), and mix (approximately 0.3 percentage points), partially
offset by a higher level of promotional spending (approximately 0.1 percentage points), costs
associated with the relocation and start-up of a replacement refrigerated soup facility
(approximately 0.1 percentage points), a benefit from a change in the method of accounting for
inventory in 2006 (approximately 0.2 percentage points), and the impact of cost inflation and other
factors (approximately 2.9 percentage points). The percentage point increase in 2006 was due to
higher selling prices (approximately 2.0 percentage points), productivity improvements
(approximately 1.8 percentage points), and a benefit from a change in the method of accounting for
inventory (approximately 0.2 percentage points), partially offset by a higher level of promotional
spending (approximately 0.1 percentage points), mix (approximately 0.2 percentage points) and cost
inflation and other factors (approximately 2.8 percentage points).

Gross profit would have been $4 million lower in 2005 had all stock-based compensation been
expensed.

Marketing and Selling Expenses

Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 16.8% in
2007, 16.7% in 2006 and 16.3% in 2005. Marketing and selling expenses increased 8% in 2007 from
2006. The increase was primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense
(approximately 5 percentage points), higher selling expenses (approximately 1 percentage point)
and the impact of currency (approximately 1 percentage point). Marketing and selling expenses
increased 6% in 2006. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising (approximately 3
percentage points), higher selling expenses (approximately 2 percentage points) and increased
stock-based compensation recognized under SFAS No. 123R (approximately 1 percentage point).

Marketing and selling expenses would have been $12 million higher in 2005 had all stock-based
compensation been expensed.

Administrative Expenses

Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.7% in 2007, 7.9% in
2006 and 7.4% in
2005. Administrative expenses increased 4% in 2007 from
2006. The increase was due to higher incentive compensation costs (approximately 2 percentage
points), costs associated with the ongoing implementation of the SAP enterprise-resource planning
system in North America (approximately 1 percentage point), costs to establish businesses in Russia
and China (approximately 1 percentage point), the impact of currency (approximately 1 percentage
point) and higher general administrative expenses (approximately 2 percentage points), partially
offset by the reversal of $20 million of legal reserves resulting from favorable results in
litigation (approximately 3 percentage points). Administrative expenses increased 12% in 2006 from
2005. The increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation recognized under SFAS No.
123R (approximately 5 percentage points), higher compensation and benefit expenses (approximately 4
percentage points), and an increase in costs associated with the ongoing implementation of the SAP
enterprise-resource planning system in North America (approximately 2 percentage points).

Administrative expenses would have been $25 million higher in 2005 had all stock-based
compensation been expensed.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased $8 million or 8% in
2007 from 2006 primarily due to expenses related to new product development (approximately 4
percentage points), higher incentive compensation costs (approximately 2 percentage points) and
the impact of currency (approximately 1 percentage point). Research and development expenses
increased $11 million or 12% in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to higher stock-based compensation
recognized under SFAS No. 123R (approximately 4 percentage points), higher compensation and
benefit expenses (approximately 4 percentage points) and expenses related to new product
development (approximately 4 percentage points).

Research and development expenses would have been $4 million higher in 2005 had all stock-based
compensation been expensed.

Other Expenses / (Income)

Other income of $35 million in 2007 included a $23 million gain on the
sale of an idle manufacturing facility, a $10 million gain on a settlement in lieu of condemnation
of a refrigerated soup facility, and a $3 million gain on the sale of the company’s business in
Papua New Guinea.



Other expense of $5 million in 2006 included the cost of acquiring the rights to the

Pepperidge Farm Goldfish

trademark in certain non-U.S. countries and a write-down of a trademark
used in the Australian snack foods market.

Other income of $5 million in 2005 was primarily royalty income related to the company’s brands.

Operating Earnings

Segment operating earnings increased 11% in 2007 from 2006. Segment operating
earnings increased 5% in 2006 from 2005. Operating earnings would have been $45 million lower in
2005 had all stock-based compensation been expensed.

Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages increased 6% in 2007 from 2006. The 2006 results
included an $8 million benefit from the change in the method of accounting for inventories. The
remaining increase in earnings was primarily due to the increase in sales and productivity
improvements, partially offset by cost inflation and higher advertising expense.

Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages increased 9% in 2006 from 2005. The 2006 results
included an $8 million benefit from the change in the method of accounting for inventories. The
2005 earnings would have been $4 million lower had all stock-based compensation been expensed. The
remaining increase in earnings was primarily due to higher selling prices and productivity gains,
which were partially offset by cost inflation and higher advertising expense.

Earnings from Baking and Snacking increased 28% in 2007 from 2006. The 2007 results included a $23
million gain from the sale of an idle Pepperidge Farm manufacturing facility. The 2006 results
included a $5 million benefit from the change in the method of accounting for inventories. The
remaining increase was primarily due to higher earnings at Pepperidge Farm and the favorable
impact of currency. Within Arnott’s, excluding the impact of currency, an earnings increase in the
biscuit business was offset by a decline in the Australian snack foods business.

Earnings from Baking and Snacking decreased 6% in 2006 from 2005. The 2006 results included a $5

would have been $8 million lower had all stock-based compensation been expensed. The earnings
results were driven by declines in the Indonesian biscuit business and the Australian snack foods
business, and the unfavorable impact of currency, partially offset by higher earnings at Pepperidge
Farm.

Earnings from International Soup and Sauces increased 17% in 2007 from 2006. The increase in
earnings was primarily due to earnings growth in the businesses in Europe and Canada and the
favorable impact of currency, partially offset by costs to establish businesses in Russia and
China.

Earnings from International Soup and Sauces increased 1% in 2006 from 2005. The 2005 earnings would
have been $3 million lower had all stock-based compensation been expensed. The increase in earnings
was primarily due to strong market performance in Canada, partially offset by expenses associated
with improving the cost structure of the supply chain in Europe and realigning the organizational
structure in Europe following the sale of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses.

Earnings from Other increased 13% in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to improved operating earnings
performance from the Away From Home business and a gain on settlement in lieu of condemnation of a
refrigerated soup facility, partially offset by relocation and start-up costs associated with the
replacement facility.

Earnings from Other were $110 million in both 2006 and 2005. Earnings in 2005 would have been $6
million lower had all stock-based awards been expensed. The increase was primarily due to earnings
growth in Godiva Chocolatier.

Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $3 million from $105 million in 2006 to $102 million in
2007. The decrease was primarily due to the reversal of $20 million of legal reserves resulting
from favorable results in litigation, mostly offset by higher incentive compensation expenses and
higher expenses associated with the ongoing implementation of the SAP enterprise-resource planning
system in North America.

Unallocated corporate expenses increased $39 million from $66 million in 2005 to $105 million in
2006. The 2005 expenses would have been $24 million higher had all stock-based compensation been
expensed. The remaining increase was primarily due to costs associated with the ongoing
implementation of the SAP enterprise-resource planning system in North America.



Interest Expense/Income

Interest expense decreased 1% in 2007 from 2006. The current year included
a $4 million reduction in interest associated with the APA settlement. In 2006, interest expense
included a non-cash reduction of $21 million related to a favorable tax settlement of a U.S. tax
contingency. The remaining net reduction in 2007 was primarily due to lower debt levels and lower
interest expense associated with tax matters, partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest
income increased to $19 million in 2007 from $15 million in 2006 due to higher levels of cash and
cash equivalents.

Interest expense decreased 10% in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to the non-cash reduction of $21
million associated with the favorable settlement of a U.S. tax contingency and lower levels of
debt, partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest income increased to $15 million in 2006
from $4 million in
2005 due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents.

Taxes on Earnings

The effective tax rate was 28.4% in 2007, 24.6% in 2006, and 32.4% in 2005. The
increase in rate from
2006 to 2007 was primarily attributable to lower tax settlement amounts and higher taxes on
foreign earnings in 2007. The current year included a benefit of $22 million resulting from the
favorable settlement of the APA and an additional net benefit of $40 million following the
finalization of the 2002-2004 U.S. federal tax audits. The prior year period included a benefit of
$47 million resulting from the favorable resolution of a U.S. tax contingency and a benefit of $21
million related to the favorable resolution of the 1996-2001 U.S. federal tax audits. After
factoring in these items, the increase in the 2007 effective rate is primarily due to higher taxes
on foreign earnings.

The reduction in rate from 2005 to 2006 was attributable primarily to the favorable resolution of
federal income tax audits, a $10 million increased deduction related to U.S. manufacturing
activities under the AJCA, and higher levels of foreign tax credits of $14 million, partially
offset by incremental tax expense associated with the repatriation of
non-U.S. earnings under the
AJCA of $13 million.

The effective tax rate is expected to increase to 32% to 33% in 2008.

The 2007 results included
a $24 million after-tax gain, or $.06 per share, on the sale. The 2007
results also included a $7 million tax benefit from the favorable resolution of tax audits in the
United Kingdom.

The 2006 results included $56 million of deferred tax expense, which was recognized in accordance
with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 93-17 “Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for a Parent
Company’s Excess Tax Basis in the Stock of a Subsidiary That is Accounted for as a Discontinued
Operation.” Results also included $7 million pre tax ($5 million after tax) of costs associated
with the sale of the businesses. The remaining increase in earnings in 2006 from 2005 was
primarily due to lower marketing and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decline in
sales, the unfavorable impact of currency, and a higher tax rate.

The company used $620 million of the net proceeds from the sale to purchase company stock. The
remaining net proceeds were used to settle foreign currency hedging contracts associated with
intercompany financing transactions of the business, to pay taxes and expenses associated with the
sale, and to repay debt.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The company expects that foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements, including
cash outflows to repurchase shares and pay dividends, will be met through cash and cash
equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operations, long-term borrowings under its shelf
registration and short-term borrowings, including commercial paper. Over the last three years,
operating cash flows totaled approximately $2.9 billion. This cash generating capability provides
the company with substantial financial flexibility in meeting its operating



and investing needs. The company believes that its sources of financing are adequate to meet its
future liquidity and capital resource requirements. The cost and terms of any future financing
arrangements depend on the market conditions and the company’s financial position at that time.

Net cash flows from operating activities provided $674 million in 2007, compared to $1,226
million in 2006. The reduction was due primarily to an increase in working capital in 2007 as
compared to a decline in 2006 and payments of $186 million to settle hedging transactions,
primarily related to foreign currency. Net cash flows from operating activities provided $1,226
million in 2006, compared to $990 million in 2005. The increase was due primarily to a reduction
in working capital and an increase in earnings.

Capital expenditures were $334 million in 2007, $309 million in 2006 and $332 million in 2005.
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million in 2008. Capital expenditures
in 2007 and 2006 included investments to increase the manufacturing capacity for refrigerated
soups in a new facility, implement the SAP enterprise-resource planning system in North America,
and implement certain productivity and quality projects in manufacturing facilities. Capital
expenditures in 2005 included investments to increase manufacturing capacity for microwavable
products, implement the SAP enterprise-resource planning system in North America, increase
manufacturing capacity for refrigerated soups, and implement a new sales and distribution system
in Australia.

Net cash provided by investing activities in 2007 includes $906 million of proceeds from the sale
of the businesses in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Papua New Guinea, net of cash divested.

There were no new long-term borrowings in 2007 and 2005. Long-term borrowings in 2006 included the
issuance of $202 million of five-year variable-rate debt in Australia due July 2011. The proceeds
were used to repatriate earnings pursuant to the AJCA. While planning for the issuance of the
debt, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the interest rate
on $149 million of the debt prior to its issuance.

Dividend payments were $308 million in 2007, $292 million in 2006 and $275 million in 2005. Annual
dividends declared in 2007 were $.80 per share, $.72 per share in 2006 and $.68 per share in 2005.
The 2007 fourth quarter rate was $.20 per share.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on
vesting of restricted shares, the company repurchased 30 million
shares at a cost of $1,140 million during 2007.

Of the 2007 repurchases, approximately 21 million shares at a cost of $820
million were made pursuant to the company’s two publicly announced share repurchase programs. The
remaining shares were repurchased to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the
company’s stock compensation plans. Under the first share repurchase program, which was announced
on November 21, 2005, the company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $600
million of company stock through fiscal 2008. Under the second share repurchase program, which was
announced on August 15, 2006, the company’s Board of Directors authorized using up to $620 million
of the net proceeds from the sale of United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to purchase company
stock. The August 2006 program terminated at the end of fiscal 2007. Pursuant to the publicly
announced programs, the company entered into two accelerated share repurchase agreements on
September 28, 2006, with a financial institution to repurchase approximately $600 million of
stock. These agreements were settled in July 2007. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements and “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for additional information on these agreements.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on
vesting of restricted shares, the company repurchased 15 million shares at a cost of $506 million
during 2006 and 4 million shares at a cost of $110 million during 2005. Of the 2006 repurchases, 6
million shares at a cost of $200 million were under the Board of Directors authorization announced
on November 21, 2005. See “Market for Registrant’s Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for more information.

At July 29, 2007, the company had $595 million of notes payable due within one year and $33
million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. The company maintained a
$1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility, which was unused at July 29, 2007, except for $1
million of standby letters of credit. Another $32 million of standby letters of credit was issued
under a separate facility. In September 2006, the company entered into the $1.5 billion, 5-year
revolving credit facility that will mature in September 2011. This agreement supports the
company’s commercial paper programs.

As of July 29, 2007, the company had $300 million available for issuance under a $1 billion shelf
registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2002. Under the
registration statement, the company may issue debt securities, depending on market conditions.

The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its revolving credit facilities and
debt securities.



Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the company’s obligations and
commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations. For additional
information on debt, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases are
primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities, retail store space, and certain
equipment. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements
related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. These
commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other long-term liabilities
primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations. For additional
information on other long-term liabilities, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Includes capital lease obligations totaling $13 million, unamortized net premium on debt
issuances, unamortized gain on a terminated interest rate swap and a loss on fair-value
interest rate swaps.
For additional information on debt obligations, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.


Interest payments for notes payable, long-term debt and derivative instruments are calculated
as follows. For notes payable, interest is based on par values and rates of contractually
obligated issuances at fiscal year end. For fixed-rate long-term debt, interest is based on
principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at fiscal year end. For variable-rate long-term debt,
interest is based on principal amounts and rates estimated over the life of the instrument
using forward interest rates and applicable spreads. Interest on fixed-rate derivative
instruments is based on notional amounts and fixed interest rates contractually obligated at
fiscal year end. Interest on variable-rate derivative instruments is based on notional amounts
contractually obligated at fiscal year end and rates estimated over the instrument’s life
using forward interest rates plus applicable spreads.


Represents payments of cross-currency swaps and forward exchange contracts.


Represents other long-term liabilities, excluding deferred taxes and minority interest. This
table does not include postretirement benefits, payments related to pension plans or unvested
stock-based compensation. The company made a $35 million voluntary contribution to a U.S.
pension plan subsequent to July 29, 2007. For additional information on pension and
postretirement benefits, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments

The company guarantees approximately
1,700 bank loans to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party financial
institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The maximum potential amount

of the future payments the company could be required to
make under the guarantees is $136 million. The company’s guarantees are indirectly secured by the
distribution routes. The company does not believe that it is probable that it will be required to
make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. See also Note 12 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off-balance sheet arrangements.

On
September 28, 2006, the company entered into two accelerated share repurchase agreements
(Agreements) with Lehman Brothers Financial S.A. (Lehman), an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc., to
repurchase approximately $600 million of common stock. Under the first Agreement, the company
purchased approximately 8.3 million shares of its common stock from Lehman for $300 million, or
$35.95 per share, subject to a purchase price adjustment payable upon settlement of the Agreement.
Lehman was expected to purchase an equivalent number of shares during the term of the Agreement. On
July 5, 2007, upon conclusion of the Agreement, the company made a settlement payment of $22
million to Lehman, which was recorded as a reduction of Additional paid-in capital, based upon the
difference between the volume weighted-average price of the company’s common stock during the
Agreement’s term of $38.90 and the purchase price of $35.95.

Under the second Agreement, the company purchased approximately $300 million of its common stock
from Lehman. Under this Agreement, Lehman made an initial delivery of 6.3 million shares on
September 29, 2006 at $35.95 per share and a second delivery of 1.3 million shares on October 25,
2006 at $36.72 per share. Under the Agreement, the number of additional shares (if any) to be
delivered to the company at settlement would be based on the volume weighted-average price of
company stock during the term of the Agreement, subject to a minimum and maximum price for the
purchased shares. The volume weighted-average price during the term of the Agreement was $38.90. On
July 5, 2007, upon conclusion of the Agreement, Lehman delivered approximately 200,000 shares to
the company as a final settlement. For additional information on the Agreements, see Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements and “Market for Registrant’s Capital Stock, Related Shareowner
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.”

Inflation

During the past three years, inflation, on average, has been higher than previous years but
has not had a significant effect on the company. The company uses a number of strategies to
mitigate the effects of cost inflation. These strategies include increasing prices, pursuing cost
productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies, and making capital investments
that improve the efficiency of operations.



Market Risk Sensitivity

The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in commodity prices,
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the company is exposed to equity
price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. The company manages its
exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt
and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable-to-total debt ratio within
targeted guidelines. International operations, which accounted for approximately 30% of 2007 net
sales, are concentrated principally in Australia, Canada, France and Germany. The company manages
its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing
cross-currency swaps and forward contracts. Swaps and forward contracts are entered into for
periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of
those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and does not
use leveraged instruments.

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term
supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain
commodities and agricultural products. The company may also enter
into commodity futures contracts, as considered

appropriate, to reduce the
volatility of price fluctuations for commodities such as corn, cocoa, soybean meal, soybean oil,
wheat, dairy and natural gas. At July 29, 2007 and July 30, 2006, the notional values and
unrealized gains or losses on commodity futures contracts held by the company were not material.

The information below summarizes the company’s market risks associated with debt obligations and
other significant financial instruments as of July 29, 2007. Fair values included herein have been
determined based on quoted market prices. The information presented below should be read in
conjunction with Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The table below presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity
for debt obligations. Interest rates disclosed on variable-rate debt maturing in 2008 represent the
weighted-average rates at the period end. Interest rates disclosed on variable-rate debt maturing
in 2011 represent the weighted-average forward rates for the term. Notional amounts and related
interest rates of interest rate swaps are presented by fiscal year of maturity. For the swaps,
variable rates are the weighted-average forward rates for the term of each contract.

The company had an additional $17 million in a number of smaller contracts to purchase or sell
various other currencies, such as the Australian dollar, euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and
Swedish krona, as of July 29, 2007. The aggregate fair value of all contracts was a loss of $4
million as of July 29, 2007. The total forward exchange contracts outstanding, excluding
contracts related to the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses, as of July 30, 2006 were $110
million with a fair value of a gain of $2 million.

The forward exchange contracts related to the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses outstanding
as of July 30, 2006, which were settled in August 2006 in connection with the sale, were $413
million and had an aggregate fair value of a loss of $5 million as of July 30, 2006.

The company had swap contracts outstanding as of July 29, 2007, which hedge a portion of
exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return



of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the total return of the company’s capital stock and the total
return of the Puritan Fund. Under these contracts, the company pays variable interest rates and
receives from the counterparty either the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index total return, the Puritan
Fund total return, or the total return on company capital stock. The notional value of the contract
that is linked to the return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was $22 million at July 29, 2007
and $18 million at July 30, 2006. The average forward interest rate applicable to the contract,
which expires in 2008, was 5.30% at July 29, 2007. The notional value of the contract that is linked
to the return on the Puritan Fund was $13 million at July 29, 2007 and $10 million at July 30,
2006. The average forward interest rate applicable to the contract, which expires in 2008, was
5.54% at July 29, 2007. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on
company capital stock was $29 million at July 29, 2007 and $27 million at July 30, 2006. The
average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2008, was 5.50% at July
29, 2007. The fair value of these contracts was a $2 million loss at July 29, 2007 and a $2 million
gain at July 30, 2006.

The company’s utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described
above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a
function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt
and foreign currency, and the company’s acquisition and divestiture activities.

Significant Accounting Estimates

The consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those
estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of
significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex
judgments, estimates and assumptions:

Trade and consumer promotion programs

The company offers various sales incentive programs to
customers and consumers, such as cooperative advertising programs, feature price discounts,
in-store display incentives and coupons. The recognition of the costs for these programs, which are
classified as a reduction of revenue, involves use of judgment related to performance and
redemption estimates. Estimates

are made based on historical experience and other factors. Actual expenses may differ if the level
of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates.

Valuation of long-lived assets

Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangibles, are
reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess
nonamortizable intangible asset impairment, while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to
assess other long-lived asset impairment. The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable
management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance.
Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. The actual cash flows
could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating
performance, and economic conditions.

Pension and postretirement benefits

The company provides certain pension and postretirement
benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is
dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan
assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries,
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the
required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that differ from the actuarial
assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods.

The discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal year-end measurement date. In
establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high-quality debt
securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply
high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return
on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future
performance, considering the company’s current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based
on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a
premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise
between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in
the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the
difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method. Gains and
losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at
each measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or
liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year.



Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was $57 million in 2007, $77 million in 2006, and
$67 million in 2005. Significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year are as
follows:

Pension




Discount rate for benefit obligations

6.40

6.05

Ultimate health care trend rate

Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50 basis point
reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $11 million; a 50 basis
point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by
approximately $9 million. A one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would
increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $1 million.

Although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the U.S. plans in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
the company made a $22 million contribution in 2007 and a $35 million contribution in 2006 and
2005 to a U.S. plan based on expected future funding requirements. Contributions to international
plans were $10 million in 2007, $17 million in 2006 and $26 million in 2005. Subsequent to July
29, 2007, the company made a $35 million voluntary contribution to a U.S. plan in anticipation of
future funding requirements. Contributions to non-U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $9
million in 2008.

As of July 29, 2007, the company
adopted SFAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined benefit
postretirement plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and requires any unrecognized
prior service cost and actuarial gains/losses to be recognized in other comprehensive income.

See also Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension
and postretirement expenses.

Income taxes

The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities
available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management’s estimate of
the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in
determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Tax reserves are established
when, despite the company’s belief that tax return positions are fully supportable, certain
positions are subject to challenge and the

company may not successfully defend its position. These reserves, as
well as the related interest, are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as
the progress of a tax audit. While it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of
resolution of any particular tax matter, the company believes that the reserves reflect the
probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable
or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for
deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. See
also the section entitled Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Notes 2 and 8 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes, including the impact of
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48 “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.”

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 clarifies the criteria that must be met for
financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return. This Interpretation also addresses derecognition, recognition of related penalties
and interest, classification of liabilities and disclosures of unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The company will adopt FIN 48 as of
July 30, 2007 and will record the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 as a charge to fiscal 2008
opening retained earnings and accrued taxes. Interest recognized in accordance with FIN 48 may be
classified in the financial statements as either income taxes or interest expense. Historically the
company recorded interest on tax matters in interest expense and accrued interest. The company will
record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense and accrued
income taxes upon adoption of FIN 48. The adoption of FIN 48 will not have a significant impact on
the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. Upon
adoption, a cumulative effect adjustment of $6 million will be charged to retained earnings to
increase reserves for uncertain tax positions.



In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements,” which provides enhanced
guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 establishes a
definition of fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the
disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted. The company is currently
evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” SFAS No. 159 allows companies to
choose, at specific election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair
value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company elects the fair
value option for an eligible item, changes in that item’s fair value in subsequent reporting
periods must be recognized in current earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. The company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159.

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results

This Report contains “forward-looking” statements that reflect the company’s current
expectations regarding future results of operations, economic performance, financial condition and
achievements of the company. The company tries, wherever possible, to identify these
forward-looking statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,”
“will” and similar expressions. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. These statements reflect the company’s current plans and
expectations and are based on information currently available to it. They rely on a number of
assumptions regarding future events and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are
inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.

The company wishes to caution the reader that the following important factors and those important
factors described in Part 1, Item 1A and elsewhere in the commentary, or in the Securities and
Exchange Commission filings of the company, could affect the company’s actual results and could
cause such results to vary materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made
by, or on behalf of, the company:

•

the impact of strong competitive response to the company’s efforts to leverage its brand
power with product innovation, promotional programs and new advertising, and of changes in
consumer demand for the company’s products;

•

the risks in the marketplace associated with trade and consumer acceptance of product
improvements, shelving initiatives and new product introductions;

This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important
factors that may impact the company’s outlook. The company disclaims any obligation or intent to
update forward-looking statements made by the company in order to reflect new information, events
or circumstances after the date they are made.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

NOTE 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated in
consolidation. Certain amounts in prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to
the current-year presentation. The company’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest July 31. There
were 52 weeks in 2007, 2006, and 2005. There will be 53 weeks in 2008.

On August 15, 2006, the company completed the sale of its United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to
Premier Foods Investments Limited, HL Foods Limited and Premier Foods pic for £460, or
approximately $870, pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated July 12, 2006. The company has
reflected the results of these businesses as discontinued operations in the consolidated
statements of earnings for all years presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses
were reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale in the
consolidated balance sheet as of July 30,
2006. See Note 3 for additional information on the sale.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete. This occurs when
products are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to
customers, collection is probable and pricing is fixed or determinable. Revenues are recognized net
of provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Certain sales promotion expenses, such as
coupon redemption costs, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, feature
price discounts and in-store display incentives are classified as a reduction of sales.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less are classified as cash equivalents.

Inventories

In 2006 and 2007, all inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
Prior to 2006, substantially all U.S. inventories were valued based on the last in, first out
(LIFO) method. See also Note 13.

In November 2004, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151 “Inventory Costs — an
amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4” was issued. SFAS No. 151 is the result of efforts to converge
U.S. accounting standards for inventories with International Accounting Standards. SFAS No. 151
requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage to be
recognized as current-period charges. It also requires that allocation of fixed production
overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
SFAS No. 151 was effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 in 2006 did not have a material impact on the financial
statements.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost and
are depreciated over estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings and
machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods not exceeding 45 years and 15 years,
respectively. Assets are evaluated for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable. Such conditions include significant adverse changes in business climate or
a plan of disposal.

In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No.
(FIN) 47 “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 143.” This Interpretation clarifies that a conditional retirement obligation refers
to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method
of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the
entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though
uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. Accordingly, an entity is
required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation
if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The liability should be recognized
when incurred, generally upon acquisition, construction or development of the asset. The company
adopted FIN 47 in 2006. The adoption did not have a material impact on the financial statements.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized
but rather are tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets.” Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated
useful life and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets.” Goodwill impairment testing first requires a
comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value. If the carrying value
exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of impairment is the difference
between the carrying value of goodwill and the “implied” fair value, which is calculated as if the
reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination. Impairment
testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value and
carrying value of the asset. If carrying value exceeds the fair value, the asset is reduced to
fair value. Fair values are primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses. See Note 5
for information on goodwill and other intangible assets.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for
purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
commodities and equity-linked employee benefit obligations. All derivatives are recognized on the
balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings or
other comprehensive



income, based on whether the instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so,
the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by
the underlying hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in earnings in the
current period. See Note 10 for additional information.

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) “Share-Based
Payment” (SFAS No. 123R), which requires stock-based compensation to be measured based on the
grant-date fair value of the awards and the cost to be recognized over the period during which an
employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The company adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 123R as of August 1, 2005. The company provides compensation benefits by
issuing stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock (including
EPS performance restricted stock and total shareowner return (TSR) performance restricted stock)
and restricted stock units.

Prior to August 1, 2005, the company accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related
Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense had been recognized for stock options since
all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the
grant date. SFAS No. 123R was adopted using the modified prospective transition method. Under this
method, the provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of
adoption. In addition, compensation expense must be recognized for any unvested stock option awards
outstanding as of the date of adoption. Prior periods have not been restated. See also Note 11.
Total pre-tax stock-based compensation recognized in the Statements
of Earnings was $83, $85 and
$26 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Tax related benefits of $31 were also recognized for
2007 and 2006 and $10 for 2005. Amounts recorded in 2005 primarily represent expenses related to
restricted stock awards since no expense was recognized for stock options. Stock-based compensation
associated with discontinued operations was not material.

SFAS No. 123R requires disclosure of pro forma information for periods prior to the adoption. The
pro forma disclosures are based on the fair value of awards at the grant date, amortized to expense
over the service period. The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings per share if
the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R to stock-based
employee compensation.

Use of Estimates

Generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues
and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109 “Accounting for Income
Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets
when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (the AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA provides
for a deduction of 85% of certain non-U.S. earnings that are repatriated, as defined by the AJCA,
and a phased-in tax deduction related to profits from domestic manufacturing activities. In
December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 109-1 and 109-2 to address the accounting
and disclosure requirements related to the AJCA. The total amount repatriated in 2006 under the
AJCA was $494 and the related tax cost was $20. In 2005, the company recorded $7 in tax expense
for $200 of anticipated earnings to be repatriated. In 2006, the company finalized its plan under
the AJCA and recorded tax expense of $13 for $294 of earnings repatriated.



NOTE 2.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 clarifies the criteria that must be met for
financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return. This Interpretation also addresses derecognition, recognition of related penalties
and interest, classification of liabilities and disclosures of unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The company will adopt FIN 48 as of
July 30, 2007 and will record the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 as a charge to fiscal 2008
opening retained earnings and accrued taxes. Interest recognized in accordance with FIN 48 may be
classified in the financial statements as either income taxes or interest expense. Historically the
company recorded interest on tax matters in interest expense and accrued interest. The company will
record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense and accrued
income taxes upon adoption of FIN 48. The adoption of FIN 48 will not have a significant impact on
the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. Upon
adoption, a cumulative effect adjustment of $6 will be charged to retained earnings to increase
reserves for uncertain tax positions.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).” SFAS
No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans
as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and requires any unrecognized prior service cost and
actuarial gains/losses to be recognized in other comprehensive income. In addition, SFAS No. 158
requires that changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan be recognized
in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The requirement to recognize the
funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and other disclosure requirements of SFAS
No. 158 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The company adopted SFAS No.
158 as of the end of fiscal 2007. The adoption does not impact the consolidated results of
operations or cash flows of the company. See also Note 7 for additional information.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements,” which provides enhanced
guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 establishes a
definition of fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the
disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted. The company is currently
evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” SFAS No. 159 allows companies to
choose, at specific election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair
value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company elects the fair
value option for an eligible item, changes in that item’s fair value in subsequent reporting
periods must be recognized in current earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. The company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No.
159.

Divestitures

Discontinued Operations

On August 15, 2006, the company completed the sale of its businesses in the United Kingdom
and Ireland for £460, or approximately $870, pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated July
12, 2006. The United Kingdom and Ireland businesses included

Homepride

sauces,

OXO

stock cubes,

Batchelors

soups and

McDonnells

and

Erin

soups. The Sale and Purchase Agreement provides for
working capital and other post-closing adjustments. Additional proceeds of $19 were received from
the finalization of the post-closing adjustment. The company has reflected the results of these
businesses as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all years
presented. The businesses were historically included in the International Soup and Sauces
segment.

Results of discontinued operations were as follows:

The 2007 results included a $24 after-tax gain, or $.06 per share, on the sale. The 2007
results also included a $7 tax benefit from the favorable resolution of tax audits in the United
Kingdom.

The 2006 results included deferred tax expense of $56, which was recognized in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 93-17 “Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for a Parent
Company’s Excess Tax Basis in the Stock of a



Subsidiary That is Accounted for as a Discontinued Operation” due to book/tax basis differences of
these businesses as of July 30, 2006. The 2006 results also
included $7 pre tax ($5 after tax) of
costs associated with the sale, for a total net after-tax cost of $61 (or $.15 per share)
recognized in connection with the sale in 2006.

The assets and liabilities of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses are reflected as
discontinued operations held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of July 30, 2006 and
are comprised of the following:


Cash

The company used approximately $620 of the net proceeds to repurchase shares. See Note 11 to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Upon completion of the sale, the
company paid $83 to settle cross-currency swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts
which hedged exposures related to the businesses. The remaining net proceeds were used to pay
taxes and expenses associated with the business and to repay debt.

Other Divestitures

On June 7, 2007, the company completed the sale of its ownership interest in Papua New Guinea
operations for approximately $23. The company recognized a $3 gain on the sale. This business was
historically included in the Baking and Snacking segment and had annual sales of approximately
$20.

NOTE 4.

Comprehensive Income

Total comprehensive income is comprised of net earnings, net foreign currency translation
adjustments, minimum pension liability adjustments (see Note 7), and net unrealized gains and
losses on cash-flow hedges (see Note 10). Accumulated other comprehensive loss at July 29, 2007
also includes the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158. (See Notes 2 and 7.) Total comprehensive income
for the twelve months ended July 29, 2007, July 30, 2006 and July 31, 2005 was $957, $993 and
$688, respectively.

the results of operations in the following segments: U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages, Baking and
Snacking, International Soup and Sauces, and Other.

The U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment includes the following retail businesses:

Campbell’s

condensed and ready-to-serve soups;

Swanson

broth and canned poultry;

Prego

pasta sauce;

Pace

Mexican sauce;

Campbell’s Chunky

chili;

Campbell’s

crackers, bakery and frozen products in U.S. retail;

Arnott’s

biscuits in Australia and Asia
Pacific; and

Arnott’s

salty snacks in Australia. In June 2007, the company sold its ownership
interest in Papua New Guinea operations, which historically were included in this segment.

The International Soup and Sauces segment includes the soup, sauce and beverage businesses outside
of the United States, including Europe, Mexico, Latin America, the Asia Pacific region and the
retail business in Canada. See also Note 3 for information on the sale of the businesses in the
United Kingdom and Ireland. These businesses were historically included in this segment. The assets
of these businesses were reflected as discontinued operations as of July 30, 2006. The results of
operations of these businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations for all years
presented.

The balance of the portfolio reported in Other includes Godiva Chocolatier worldwide and the
company’s Away From Home operations, which represent the distribution of products such as soup,
specialty entrees, beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm products through
various food service channels in the United States and Canada.

Accounting policies for measuring segment assets and earnings before interest and taxes are
substantially consistent with those described in Note 1. The company evaluates segment performance
before interest and taxes. Away From Home products are principally produced by the tangible assets
of the company’s other segments, except for refrigerated soups, which are produced in a separate
facility, and certain other products, which are produced under contract manufacturing agreements.
Accordingly, with the exception of the designated refrigerated soup facility, plant assets are not
allocated to the Away From Home operations. Depreciation, however, is allocated to Away From Home
based on production hours.

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for
approximately 15% of consolidated net sales in 2007 and 14% in 2006 and 2005. All of the company’s
segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates.

NOTE 7.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

Substantially all of the company’s U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees are
covered by noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. In 1999, the company implemented
significant amendments to certain U.S. plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are
determined based on percentages of annual pay and age. To minimize the impact of converting to the
new formula, service and earnings credit continues to accrue for active employees participating in
the plans under the formula prior to the amendments through the year 2014. Employees will receive
the benefit from either the new or old formula, whichever is higher. Benefits become vested upon
the completion of five years of service. Benefits are paid from funds previously provided to
trustees and insurance companies or are paid directly by the company from general funds. Plan
assets consist primarily of investments in equities, fixed income securities, and real estate.



Postretirement Benefits

The company provides postretirement benefits including health care and
life insurance to substantially all retired U.S. employees and their dependents. In 1999, changes
were made to the postretirement benefits offered to certain U.S. employees. Participants who were
not receiving postretirement benefits as of May 1, 1999 will no longer be eligible to receive such
benefits in the future, but the company will provide access to health care coverage for
non-eligible future retirees on a group basis. Costs will be paid by the participants. To preserve
the economic benefits for employees near retirement as of May 1, 1999, participants who were at
least age 55 and had at least 10 years of continuous service remain eligible for postretirement
benefits.

In 2005, the company established retiree medical account benefits for eligible U.S. retirees,
intended to provide reimbursement for eligible health care expenses.

On July 29, 2007, the company adopted SFAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined
postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and requires any
unrecognized prior service cost and actuarial gains/losses to be recognized in other comprehensive
income. SFAS No. 158 does not affect the company’s consolidated results of operations or cash
flows.

The company uses the fiscal year end as the measurement date for the benefit plans.

The following table illustrates the incremental effect of applying SFAS No. 158 on individual
line items on the July 29, 2007 Consolidated Balance Sheet:

The expected rate of return on assets for the company’s global plans is a weighted average of the
expected rates of return selected for the various countries where the company has funded pension
plans. These rates of return are set annually and are based upon an estimate of future long-term
investment returns for the projected asset allocation.

The discount rate used to determine net periodic postretirement expense was 6.25% in 2007,
5.5% in 2006 and 6.25% in 2005.

The fundamental goal underlying the pension plans’ investment policy is to ensure that the
assets of the plans are invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the plans as
these obligations come due. Investment practices must comply with applicable laws and
regulations.



The company’s investment strategy is based on an expectation that equity securities will
outperform debt securities over the long term. Accordingly, in order to maximize the return on
assets, a majority of assets are invested in equities. Additional asset classes with dissimilar
expected rates of return, return volatility, and correlations of returns are utilized to reduce
risk by providing diversification relative to equities. Investments within each asset class are
also diversified to further reduce the impact of losses in single investments. The use of
derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary to achieve overall investment
policy objectives and asset class targets.

The company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks
for each significant asset class to obtain a prudent balance between return and risk. The
interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied to assist in the
establishment of strategic asset allocation targets.

The benefit payments include payments from funded and unfunded plans.

Estimated future Medicare subsidy receipts are $3 – $4 annually from 2008 through 2012, and $20
for the period 2013 through 2017.

The company made a voluntary contribution of $35 to a U.S. pension plan subsequent to July 29,
2007. The company is not required to make additional contributions to the U.S. plans in fiscal
2008. Contributions to non-U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $9 in 2008.

Savings Plan

The company sponsors employee savings plans which cover substantially all U.S.
employees. The company provides a matching contribution of 60% (50% at certain locations) of the
employee contributions up to 5% of compensation after one year of continued service. Amounts
charged to Costs and expenses were $17 in 2007, $16 in 2006 and $14 in 2005.

In the third quarter of 2007, the company recorded a tax benefit of $22 resulting from the
settlement of bilateral advance pricing agreements (APA) among the company, the United States,
and Canada related to royalties. In addition, the company reduced net interest expense by $4
($3 after tax). The aggregate impact on Earnings from continuing operations was $25, or $.06 per
share. In 2007, the company also recognized an additional tax benefit of $40 following the
finalization of the 2002 – 2004 U.S. federal tax audits.

In 2006, the tax effect of international items in 2006 included a $14 deferred tax benefit
related to foreign tax credits, which could be utilized as a result of the sale of the United
Kingdom and Ireland businesses. See also Note 3 for information on the divestiture.

The company received an Examination Report from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on December
23, 2002, which included a challenge to the treatment of gains and interest



deductions claimed in the company’s fiscal 1995 federal income tax return, relating to
transactions involving government securities. If the proposed adjustment were upheld, it would
have required the company to pay a net amount of over $100 in taxes, accumulated interest and
penalties. The company had maintained a reserve for a portion of this contingency. In November
2005, the company negotiated a settlement of this matter with the IRS. As a result of the
settlement in the first quarter ended October 30, 2005, the company adjusted tax reserves and
recorded a $47 tax benefit. In addition, the company reduced interest expense and accrued interest
payable by $21 and adjusted deferred tax expense by $8 ($13 after tax). The aggregate non-cash
impact of the settlement on Earnings from continuing operations was $60, or $.14 per share. The
settlement did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated cash flow. In 2006, the
company also recognized an additional tax benefit of $21 related to the resolution of certain U.S.
tax issues for open tax years through 2001.

See also Note 1 for additional information on the tax impact of the repatriation of earnings under

At July 29, 2007, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company have tax loss carryforwards of
approximately $117. Of these carry-forwards, $17 expire between 2012 and 2017 and $100 may be
carried forward indefinitely. The current statutory tax rates in these countries range from 24% to
39%.

The company has undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $551. U.S. income
taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings, which are deemed to be permanently
reinvested. It is not practical to estimate the tax liability that might be incurred if such
earnings were remitted to the U.S.

NOTE 10.

Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts
payable and short-term debt approximate fair value. The fair values of long-term debt, as
indicated in Note 9, and derivative financial instruments are based on quoted market prices.

In 2001, the company adopted SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” as amended by SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149. The standard requires



that all derivative instruments
be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes
criteria for designation and effectiveness of the hedging relationships.

The company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to enhance its ability to manage
risk, including interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and
certain equity-linked deferred
compensation exposures that exist as part of ongoing business operations. Derivative instruments
are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute
positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for speculative
purposes, nor is it a party to any leveraged derivative instrument.

The company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties on
derivative contracts. The company minimizes its credit risk on these transactions by dealing only
with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions having long-term credit ratings of “A” or better
and, therefore, does not anticipate nonperformance. In addition, the contracts are distributed
among several financial institutions, thus minimizing credit risk concentration.

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative
contract is entered into, the company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of
a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair-value hedge), (2) a
hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid
related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge), (3) a foreign-currency fair-value or
cash-flow hedge (foreign-currency hedge), or (4) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation. Some derivatives may also be considered natural hedging instruments (changes in fair
value are recognized to act as economic offsets to changes in fair value of the underlying hedged
item and do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133).

Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or
liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on firm commitments),
are recorded in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a cash-flow hedge are
recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash
flows. Changes in the fair value of a foreign-currency hedge are recorded in either current-period
earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the hedge transaction is a fair-value
hedge (e.g., a hedge of a firm commitment that is to be settled in foreign currency) or a cash-flow
hedge (e.g., a hedge of a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction). If, however, a
derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair
value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustments
account within Shareowners’ equity.

The company finances a portion of its operations through debt instruments primarily consisting of
commercial paper, notes, debentures and bank loans. The company utilizes interest rate swap
agreements to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a targeted ratio of variable-rate
versus fixed-rate debt.

In July 2006, the company entered into three interest rate swaps that converted $154 of the $207
Australian variable-rate debt to a weighted-average fixed rate of 6.73%.

Fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair-value hedges. Gains and losses on
these instruments are recorded in earnings as adjustments to interest expense, offsetting gains and
losses on the hedged item. The notional amount of fair-value interest rate swaps was $675 at July
29, 2007 and $875 at July 30, 2006. The swaps had a fair value of a loss of $19 at July 29, 2007
and $29 at July 30, 2006.

Variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash-flow hedges. Consequently, the
effective portion of unrealized gains (losses) is deferred as a component of Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects
earnings. The amounts paid or received on the hedge are recognized as adjustments to interest
expense. The fair value of the swaps was not material as of July 29, 2007 and July 30, 2006. The
notional amount was $85 at July 29, 2007 and $154 at July 30, 2006.

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies
other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary financing
transactions. The company utilizes foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts and
cross-currency swaps in order to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases
and sales and certain intercompany transactions in the normal course of business.

Qualifying foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts are accounted for as
cash-flow hedges when the hedged item is a forecasted transaction, or when future cash flows
related to a recognized asset or liability are expected to be received or paid. The effective
portion of the changes in fair value on these instruments is recorded in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into the Statements of Earnings on the same line
item and in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The
assessment of effectiveness for contracts is based on changes in the spot rates. The fair value of
these instruments was a loss of $56 and $202 at July 29, 2007 and July 30, 2006, respectively. The
notional amount was $437 and $756 as of July 29, 2007 and July 30, 2006, respectively. Of the July
30, 2006 amounts, fair value of a loss of $71 was related to $270 notional value of pay fixed
GBP/receive fixed USD swaps settled upon completion of the sale of the United Kingdom and Ireland
businesses in August 2006.



Qualifying foreign exchange forward contracts are accounted for as fair-value hedges when the
hedged item is a recognized asset, liability or firm commitment. These contracts were not material
at July 29, 2007. There were no such contracts outstanding as of July 30, 2006.

The
company also enters into certain foreign exchange forward contracts and variable-to-variable
cross-currency swap contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges. These instruments are
primarily intended to reduce volatility of certain intercompany financing transactions. Gains and
losses on derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are typically recorded in Other
expenses/(income), as an offset to gains (losses) on the underlying transactions. Cross-currency
contracts mature in 2008 through 2014. The fair value of these instruments was a loss of $10 and
$18 at July 29, 2007 and July 30, 2006, respectively. Of the July 30, 2006 amount, a loss of $6 was
related to forward contracts to hedge the company’s investment in the United Kingdom and Ireland
businesses and a cross-currency swap associated with intercompany financing, which were settled
upon completion of the sale in August
2006. The notional amount of all instruments was $331 and $723 at July 29, 2007 and July 30, 2006,
respectively.

Foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of less than eighteen months.
Principal currencies include the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, euro, Japanese
yen, New Zealand dollar and Swedish krona.

As of July 29, 2007, the accumulated derivative net loss in other comprehensive income for
cash-flow hedges, including the foreign exchange forward and cross-currency contracts,
forward-starting swap contracts and treasury lock agreements, was $6, net of tax. As of July 30,
2006, the accumulated derivative net loss in other comprehensive income was $15, net of tax.
Reclassifications from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into the Statements of
Earnings during the period ended July 29, 2007 were losses of $9, primarily related to the
settlement of derivatives that hedged exposures related to the businesses in the United Kingdom
and Ireland sold in August 2006. Except for the derivatives settled in connection with the sale of
the businesses, there were no discontinued cash-flow hedges during the year. At July 29,
2007, the maximum maturity date of any cash-flow hedge was approximately 6 years. The amount
expected to be reclassified into the Statements of Earnings in 2008 is not material.

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short-and long-term
supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities
and agricultural products. The company may also enter into commodity futures contracts, as
considered appropriate, to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities such as
corn, cocoa, soybean meal, soybean oil, wheat, dairy and natural gas.
As of July 29, 2007, the
notional values and the fair values of open contracts related to commodity hedging activity were
not material.

The
company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation
obligations. Swap contracts are utilized to hedge exposures relating
to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the total
return of the company’s capital stock and the total return of the Puritan Fund. The company pays a
variable interest rate and receives the equity returns under these instruments. The notional value
of the equity swap contracts, which mature in 2008, was $64 at July 29, 2007. These instruments are
not designated as accounting hedges. Gains and losses are recorded in the Statements of Earnings.
The net liability recorded under these contracts at July 29, 2007 was approximately $2.

NOTE 11.

Shareowners’ Equity

The company has authorized 560 million shares of Capital stock with $.0375 par value and 40
million shares of Preferred stock, issuable in one or more classes, with or without par as may be
authorized by the Board of Directors. No Preferred stock has been issued.

Share Repurchase Programs

In November 2005, the company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $600 of company
stock through fiscal 2008. In August 2006, the company’s Board of Directors authorized using up to
$620 of the net proceeds from the sale of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to purchase
company stock. The August 2006 program terminated at the end of fiscal 2007. In addition to these
two publicly announced programs, the company repurchases shares to offset the impact of dilution
from shares issued under the company’s stock compensation plans.

In 2007, the company repurchased 30 million shares at a cost of $1,140. Of the 2007 repurchases,
approximately 21 million shares at a cost of $820 were made pursuant to the company’s publicly
announced share repurchase programs, with a portion executed under the accelerated share repurchase
agreements described below.

Pursuant to the publicly announced programs, the company entered into two accelerated share
repurchase agreements (Agreements) on September 28, 2006 with Lehman Brothers Financial S.A.
(Lehman), an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc., for approximately $600 of common stock.

Under the first Agreement, the company purchased approximately 8.3 million shares of its common
stock from Lehman for $300, or $35.95 per share, subject to a purchase price adjustment payable
upon settlement of the Agreement. Lehman was expected to purchase an equivalent number of shares
during the term of the Agreement. On July 5, 2007,



upon conclusion of the Agreement, the company made a settlement payment of $22 to Lehman, which was
recorded as a reduction of Additional paid-in capital, based upon the difference between the volume
weighted-average price of the company’s common stock during the Agreement’s term of $38.90 and the
purchase price of $35.95.

Under the second Agreement, the company purchased approximately $300 of its common stock from
Lehman. Under this Agreement, Lehman made an initial delivery of 6.3 million shares on September
29, 2006 at $35.95 per share and a second delivery of 1.3 million shares on October 25, 2006 at
$36.72 per share. Under the Agreement, the number of additional shares (if any) to be delivered to
the company at settlement would be based on the volume weighted-average price of company stock
during the term of the Agreement, subject to a minimum and maximum price for the purchased shares.
The volume weighted-average price during the term of the Agreement was $38.90. On July 5, 2007,
upon conclusion of the Agreement, Lehman delivered approximately 200,000 shares to the company as a
final settlement. Approximately $20 paid under the Agreement was recorded as a reduction of
Additional paid-in capital.

In 2006,
the company repurchased 15 million shares at a cost of $506. Of these repurchases, 6
million at a cost of $200 were made pursuant to the November 2005 program. The remaining
repurchases were made to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the company’s stock
compensation plans.

In 2005, the company repurchased 4 million shares at a cost of $110 million to offset the impact
of dilution from shares issued under the company’s stock compensation plans.

Stock Plans

In 2003, shareowners approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of
28 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted
stock, restricted stock (including performance restricted stock) and performance units.
Approximately 3.2 million shares available under a previous long-term plan were rolled into the
2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, making the total number of available shares approximately 31.2 million. In November 2005, shareowners approved the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized
the issuance of an additional 6 million shares to satisfy the same types of awards.

Awards under the 2003 and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans may be granted to employees and directors.
The term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of
grant. Options granted under these plans vest cumulatively over a three-year

period at a rate of 30%, 60% and 100%, respectively. The
option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of
the grant. Restricted stock granted in fiscal
2004 and 2005 vests in three annual installments of 1/3 each, beginning 2


/


years from the date of
grant.

Pursuant to the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, in July
2005 the company adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of
total shareowner return (TSR) performance restricted stock, EPS performance restricted stock, and
time-lapse restricted stock. Initial grants made in accordance with this program were approved in
September 2005. Under the program, awards of TSR performance restricted stock will be earned by
comparing the company’s total shareowner return during the period 2006 to 2008 to the respective
total shareowner returns of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon the company’s
ranking in the performance peer group, a recipient of TSR performance restricted stock may earn a
total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted
stock will be earned based upon the company’s achievement of annual earnings per share goals.
During the period 2006 to 2008, a recipient of EPS performance restricted stock may earn a total
award ranging from 0% to 100% of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted stock will
vest ratably over the three-year period. Annual stock option grants are not part of the long-term
incentive compensation program for 2006 and 2007. However, stock options may still be granted on a
selective basis under the 2003 and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $76, $35, and
$15, respectively. As of July 29, 2007, total remaining unearned compensation related to unvested
stock options was $2, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period
of less than 1 year. There were no options granted during 2007. Options granted during 2006 were
not material. The weighted-average fair value of options granted in 2006 and 2005 was



estimated as $6.85 and $4.74, respectively. The fair value of each option grant at grant date is
estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following weighted-average

The fair value of time-lapse restricted stock and EPS performance restricted stock is
determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the company’s stock at
the date of grant. Time-lapse restricted stock granted in fiscal 2004 and 2005 is expensed on a
graded-vesting basis. Time-lapse restricted stock granted in fiscal 2006 and 2007 is expensed on
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible
participants, which are expensed on an accelerated basis. EPS performance restricted stock is
expensed on a graded-vesting basis, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants,
which are expensed on an accelerated basis.

As of July 29, 2007, total remaining unearned compensation related to nonvested time-lapse
restricted stock and EPS performance restricted stock was $42, which will be amortized over the
weighted-average remaining service period of 1.7 years. The fair value of restricted stock vested
during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $53, $16, and $24, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date
fair value of restricted stock granted during 2006 and 2005 was $29.48 and $26.32, respectively.

The fair value of TSR performance restricted stock is estimated at the grant date using a Monte
Carlo simulation. The grant-date fair value of TSR performance restricted stock granted during 2006
was $28.73. Expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period. As of July 29,
2007, total remaining unearned compensation related to TSR performance restricted stock was $39
which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of 1.7 years.

Employees can elect to defer all types of restricted stock awards. These awards are classified as
liabilities because of the possibility that they may be settled in cash. The fair value is adjusted
quarterly. The total cash paid to settle the liabilities in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was not material.
The liability for deferred awards was $17 at July 29, 2007.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the company presented the tax benefits of deductions
resulting from the exercise of stock options as cash flows from operating activities in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires the cash flows from the excess tax
benefits the company realizes on stock-based compensation to be presented as cash flows from
financing activities. The excess tax benefits on the exercise of stock options and vested
restricted stock presented as cash flows from financing activities in 2007 and 2006 were $25 and
$11, respectively and presented as cash flows from operating activities in 2005 were $6. Cash
received from the exercise of stock options was $165, $236, and $71 for 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively, and is reflected in cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.

For the periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the calculations of basic
earnings per share and earnings per share assuming dilution vary in that the weighted average
shares outstanding assuming dilution include the incremental effect of stock options and restricted
stock programs, except when such effect would be antidilutive. The dilutive impact of the
accelerated share repurchase agreements described under “Share Repurchase Programs” was not
material. Stock options to purchase 1 million shares of capital stock for 2007, 3 million shares of
capital stock for 2006 and 10 million shares of capital stock for 2005 were not included in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of the stock options exceeded
the average market price of the capital stock, and therefore, would be antidilutive.



NOTE 12.

Commitments and Contingencies

On March 30, 1998, the company effected a spinoff of several of its non-core businesses to
Vlasic Foods International Inc. (VFI). VFI and several of its affiliates (collectively, Vlasic)
commenced cases under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 29, 2001 in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Vlasic’s Second Amended Joint Plan of Distribution
under Chapter 11 (the Plan) was confirmed by an order of the Bankruptcy Court dated November 16,
2001, and became effective on or about November 29, 2001. The Plan provided for the assignment of
various causes of action allegedly belonging to the Vlasic estates, including claims against the
company allegedly arising from the spinoff, to VFB L.L.C., a limited liability company (VFB) whose
membership interests were to be distributed under the Plan to Vlasic’s general unsecured creditors.

On February 19, 2002, VFB commenced a lawsuit against the company and several of its subsidiaries
in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging, among other things,
fraudulent conveyance, illegal dividends and breaches of fiduciary duty by Vlasic directors alleged
to be under the company’s control. The lawsuit sought to hold the company liable in an amount
necessary to satisfy all unpaid claims against Vlasic (which VFB estimated in the amended complaint
to be $200), plus unspecified exemplary and punitive damages.

Following a trial on the merits, on September 13, 2005, the District Court issued Post-Trial
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, ruling in favor of the company and against VFB on all
claims. The Court ruled that VFB failed to prove that the spinoff was a constructive or actual
fraudulent transfer. The Court also rejected VFB’s claim of breach of fiduciary duty, VFB’s claim
that VFI was an alter ego of the company, and VFB’s claim that the spinoff should be deemed an
illegal dividend. The judgment of the District Court was affirmed by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit on March 30, 2007. The time for any further appeal has expired.

The company is a party to other legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of
business.

Management assesses the probability of loss for all legal proceedings and claims and has recognized
liabilities for such contingencies, as appropriate. Although the results of these matters cannot be
predicted with certainty, in management’s opinion, the final outcome of legal proceedings and
claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or
financial condition of the company.

The company has certain operating lease commitments, primarily related to warehouse and office
facilities, retail store space and certain equipment. Rent expense under operating lease
commitments was $82 in 2007 and in 2006 and $84 in 2005. Future minimum annual rental payments
under these operating leases are as follows:

The company guarantees approximately 1,700 bank loans made to Pepperidge Farm independent
sales distributors by third party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes.
The maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under the
guarantees is $136. The company’s guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes.
The company does not believe it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee payments as
a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. The amounts recognized as of July 29, 2007 and
July 30, 2006 were not material.

The company has provided certain standard indemnifications in connection with divestitures,
contracts and other transactions. Certain indemnifications have finite expiration dates.
Liabilities recognized based on known exposures related to such matters were not material at July
29, 2007.

As of August 1, 2005, the company changed the method of accounting for certain U.S.
inventories from the LIFO method to the average cost method. The company believes that the
average cost method of accounting for U.S. inventories is preferable and will improve
financial reporting by better matching revenues and expenses as average cost reflects the
physical flow of inventory and current cost. In addition, the change from LIFO to average cost
will enhance the comparability of the company’s financial statements with peer companies since
the average cost method is consistent with methods used in the industry. The impact of the
change was a pre-tax $13 benefit ($8 after tax or $.02 per share). Prior periods were not
restated since the impact of the change on previously issued financial statements was not
considered material.

The deferred compensation obligation represents unfunded plans maintained for the purpose of
providing the company’s directors and certain of its executives the opportunity to defer a
portion of their compensation. All forms of compensation contributed to the deferred
compensation plans are accounted for in accordance with the underlying program. Contributions
are credited to an investment account in the participant’s name, although no funds are
actually contributed to the investment account and no investment choices are actually
purchased. Six investment choices are available, including: (1) a book account that tracks the
total return on company stock; (2) a book account that tracks performance of Fidelity’s
Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund; (3) a book account that tracks the performance of Fidelity’s
Puritan Fund; (4) a book account that tracks the performance of Fidelity’s Spartan
International Index Fund; (5) a book account that tracks the performance of Fidelity’s Spartan
Extended Market Index Fund; and (6) a book account that credits interest based on the Wall
Street Journal indexed prime rate. Participants can reallocate investments daily and are
entitled to the gains and losses on investment funds. The company recognizes an amount in the
Statements of Earnings for the market appreciation/depreciation of each fund.

REPORTS OF MANAGEMENT

Management’s Report on Financial Statements

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the company’s management in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles to reflect the financial position of the company and
its operating results. The financial information appearing throughout this Annual Report is
consistent with the financial statements. Management is responsible for the information and
representations in such financial statements, including the estimates and judgments required for
their preparation. The financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed entirely of Directors who are not
officers or employees of the company, meets regularly with the company’s worldwide internal
auditing department, other management personnel, and the independent auditors. The independent
auditors and the internal auditing department have had, and continue to have, direct access to the
Audit Committee without the presence of other management personnel, and have been directed to
discuss the results of their audit work and any matters they believe should be brought to the
Committee’s attention. The internal auditing department and the independent auditors report
directly to the Audit Committee.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America.

The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and Directors of the company; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of July 29, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on this assessment using those criteria, management
concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 29,
2007.

The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 29, 2007
has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their report, which appears herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE SHAREOWNERS AND DIRECTORS OF CAMPBELL SOUP COMPANY

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, of shareowners’ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Campbell Soup Company and its subsidiaries at July
29, 2007 and July 30, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended July 29, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 29, 2007,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audits also included performing

such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 and Note 2, the company changed its accounting for defined benefit pension
and other postretirement plans as of July 29, 2007 and share-based compensation as of August 1,
2005.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Column (a) represents stock options and restricted stock units outstanding under the 2005
Long-Term Incentive Plan, the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 1994 Long-Term Incentive
Plan. No additional awards can be made under the 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Future equity
awards under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan may take
the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance unit awards, restricted
stock, restricted performance stock, restricted stock units or stock awards. Column (b)
represents the weighted-average exercise price of the outstanding stock options only; the
outstanding restricted stock units are not included in this calculation. Column (c) represents
the maximum aggregate number of future equity awards that can be made under the 2005 Long-Term
Incentive Plan and the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan as of July 29, 2007. The maximum number
of future equity awards that can be made under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan as of July
29, 2007 is 3,473,286. The maximum number of future equity awards that can be made under the
2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan as of July 29, 2007 is 12,811,226 (the “2003 Plan Limit”). Each
stock option or stock appreciation right awarded under the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan
reduces the 2003 Plan Limit by one share. Each restricted stock unit, restricted stock,
restricted performance stock or stock award under the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan reduces
the 2003 Plan Limit by four shares. In the event any award (or portion thereof) under the 1994
Long-Term Incentive Plan lapses, expires or is otherwise terminated without the issuance of
any company stock or is settled by delivery of consideration other than company stock, the
maximum number of future equity awards that can be made under the 2003 Long-Term Incentive
Plan automatically increases by the number of such shares.


The company’s Deferred Compensation Plans (the “Plans”) allow participants the opportunity to
invest in various book accounts, including a book account that tracks the performance of the
company’s stock (the “Stock Account”). Upon distribution, participants may receive the amounts
invested in the Stock Account in the form of shares of company stock. Column (a) represents
the maximum number of shares that could be issued upon a complete distribution of all amounts
in the Stock Account. This calculation is based upon the amount of funds in the Stock Account
as of July 29, 2007 and a $37.49 share price, which was the closing price of a share of
company stock on July 27, 2007 (the last business day before July 29, 2007). 1,078,385 of the
total number of shares that could be issued upon a complete distribution of the Plans are
fully vested, and 606,032 of the shares are subject to restrictions.



Deferred Compensation Plans

The Plans are unfunded and maintained for the purpose of providing the company’s directors and
U.S.-based executives and key managers the opportunity to defer a portion of their earned
compensation. Participants may defer a portion of their base salaries and all or a portion of their
annual incentive compensation, long-term incentive awards, and director retainers and fees. The
Plans were not submitted for security holder approval because they do not provide additional
compensation to participants. They are vehicles for participants to defer earned compensation.

Each participant’s contributions to the Plans are credited to an investment account in the
participant’s name. Gains and losses in the participant’s account are based on the performance of
the investment choices the participant has selected. Six investment choices are available,
including the Stock Account. In addition to the Stock Account, participants also generally have the
opportunity to invest in (i) a book account that tracks the performance of Fidelity’s Spartan U.S.
Equity Index Fund, (ii) a book account that tracks the performance of Fidelity’s Puritan Fund,
(iii) a book account that tracks the performance of the Fidelity Spartan Extended Market Index
Fund, (iv) a book account that tracks the performance of the Fidelity Spartan International Index
Fund, and (v) a book account that credits interest at the Wall Street Journal indexed prime rate
(determined on November 1 for the subsequent calendar year).

A participant may reallocate his or her investment account at any time among the six investment
choices, except that (i) restricted stock awards must be invested in the Stock Account during the
restriction period, (ii) reallocations of the Stock Account must be made in compliance with the
company’s policies on trading company stock, and (iii) amounts invested prior to January 1, 2005
may not be reallocated to the Fidelity Spartan Extended Market Index Fund or the Fidelity Spartan
International Index Fund. Dividends on amounts invested in the Stock Account may be reallocated
among the six investment accounts, except that dividends on amounts invested in the Stock Account
prior to January 1, 2005 may not be invested in the Fidelity Spartan Extended Market Index Fund or
the Fidelity Spartan International Index Fund. The company credits a participant’s account with an
amount equal to the matching contribution that the company would have made to the participant’s
401(k) Plan account if the participant had not deferred compensation under the Plan. In addition,
for those individuals whose base salary and annual incentive compensation exceed the Internal Revenue

Service indexed compensation limit for the
401(k) Plan, the company credits such individual’s account with an amount equal to the contribution
the company would have made to the 401(k) Plan but for the compensation limit. These company
contributions vest in 20% increments over the participant’s first five (5) years of credited
service; after the participant’s first five (5) years of service, the company contributions vest
immediately. Except as described above, there is no company match on deferred compensation.

For terminations and retirements, a participant’s account is generally paid out in accordance with
the last valid distribution election made by the participant. The applicable elections include: (i)
a lump sum, (ii) 5 annual installments, (iii) 10 annual installments, (iv) 15 annual installments
(not available to participants terminated prior to their 55th birthday), and (v) 20 annual
installments (not available to participants terminated prior to their 55th birthday). For
distributions upon death, if a participant’s beneficiary is his or her spouse, the account is
generally paid out in accordance with the last valid death distribution election (or, if there is
no death distribution election, the regular distribution election). If a participant’s beneficiary
is not his or her spouse, then the account is generally paid out in a lump sum. The administrator
of the Plans has also established procedures for hardship withdrawals and, for amounts vested prior
to January 1, 2005, unplanned withdrawals. In the event of a change in control of the company, the
Stock Account is automatically converted into cash based upon a formula provided in the Plans.
