PART I

Item 1. Business

The Company

Campbell Soup Company (“Campbell” or the “company”), together with its
consolidated subsidiaries, is a global manufacturer and marketer of high
quality, branded convenience food products. Campbell was incorporated as a
business corporation under the laws of New Jersey on November 23, 1922;
however, through predecessor organizations, it traces its heritage in the food
business back to 1869. The company’s principal executive offices are in
Camden, New Jersey 08103-1799.

The company’s operations are managed and reported in four segments: North
America Soup and Away From Home, North America Sauces and Beverages, Biscuits
and Confectionery, and International Soup and Sauces. The segments are
discussed in greater detail below.

As previously reported, on July 27, 2001, the company announced a series of
multi-year initiatives aimed at strengthening the company’s position in the
soup, sauces, beverages and indulgent snack categories, both in the United
States and internationally. Over the past two years, the company has focused
its efforts on revitalizing the U.S. soup business, strengthening the company’s
broader portfolio, building new growth avenues, driving quality and
productivity and building organizational excellence. The initiatives included,
among other things:


Based on the progress to date on these initiatives and on-going assessment of
the company’s
capabilities, the company has broadened its strategic framework. In this
regard, the company’s primary focus will be all the North American thermally
processed businesses (including U.S. soup, beverages, sauces and simple meals).
Strengthening the broader portfolio for consistent sales and earnings growth
will continue to be an important commitment. The company intends to continue
to pursue both product and packaging quality improvements, and to broaden its
productivity program. Building organizational excellence and vitality will
continue to be an important initiative.

As also previously reported, on October 1, 2001, Pepperidge Farm, Incorporated,
a leading provider of premium quality baked goods, cookies and crackers and one
of the company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, announced plans to build a new
bakery in the greater Hartford area of Connecticut. The new facility, which
replaces the existing Norwalk, Connecticut bakery, is operational. It is
currently producing breads and stuffing and is expected to produce rolls in the
near future. Pepperidge Farm continues to maintain executive offices in
Norwalk, Connecticut.

See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition” and the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements (and
the Notes thereto) at pages 19 through 49 of the company’s 2003 Annual Report
to Shareowners for the fiscal year ended August 3, 2003 (“2003 Annual Report”),
which is incorporated herein by reference.

North America Soup and Away From Home

The North America Soup and Away From Home segment comprises the retail soup and
Away From Home business in the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. retail business
includes the

Campbell’s

brand condensed and ready-to-serve soups and

Swanson

broths. The segment includes the company’s total business in Canada, which
comprises

Habitant

and

Campbell’s

soups,

Prego

pasta sauce and

V8

juices. The
Away From Home operations represent the distribution of products such as

Campbell’s

soups,

Campbell’s

specialty entrees, beverage products, other
prepared foods and

Pepperidge Farm

products through various food service
channels in North America.

North America Sauces and Beverages

The North America Sauces and Beverages segment includes U.S. retail sales for

canned pastas and
gravies,

chain organization, in which both operations share substantially all
manufacturing, warehouse, distribution and sales activities.

Biscuits and Confectionery

The Biscuits and Confectionery segment includes all retail sales of

Pepperidge

Asia/Pacific, operations include

Campbell’s

soup and stock and

Swanson

broths
across the region.

Ingredients

The ingredients required for the manufacture of the company’s food products are
purchased from various suppliers. While all such ingredients are available
from numerous independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations
in price attributable to a number of factors, including changes in crop size,
cattle cycles, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export
requirements and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons.
Ingredient inventories are at a peak during the late fall and decline during
the winter and spring. Since many ingredients of suitable quality are
available in sufficient quantities only at certain seasons, the company makes
commitments for the purchase of such ingredients during their respective
seasons. In spite of the foregoing, the company does not anticipate any
material restrictions on availability or shortages of ingredients that would
have a significant impact on the company’s businesses.

Customers

In the United States, Canada, Europe and the Asia/Pacific region, sales
solicitation activities are conducted by the company’s own sales force and
through broker and distributor arrangements. In the United States and Canada,
the company’s products are generally resold to consumers in retail food chains,
mass discounters, club stores and other retail establishments. In Europe, the
company’s products are generally resold to consumers in retail food chains,
mass discounters and other retail establishments. In the Asia/Pacific region,
the company’s products are generally resold to consumers through retail food
chains, convenience stores, vending machines and other retail establishments.
In all cases, the company makes shipments promptly after receipt and acceptance
of orders.

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
accounted for approximately 12% of the company’s consolidated net sales during
fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. All of the company’s segments sold products to
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates.

Trademarks And Technology

The company owns over 6,000 trademark registrations and applications in over
160 countries and believes that its trademarks are of material importance to
its business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally are
valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly
maintained and have not been found to have become generic. Trademark
registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks
are in use. The company believes that its principal brands, including

Campbell’s, Erasco, Liebig, Pepperidge Farm, V8, Pace, Prego, Swanson,
Franco-American, Batchelors, Arnott’s,

and

Godiva,

are protected by trademark
law in the company’s relevant major markets. Some of the company’s products
are sold under brands that have been licensed from third parties.

Although the company owns a number of valuable patents, it does not regard any
segment of its business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of
related patents. In addition, the company owns copyrights, both registered and
unregistered, and proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes,
and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.


Competition

The company experiences worldwide competition in all of its principal products.
This competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes, including
producers of generic and private label products, as well as from manufacturers
of other food products, which compete for trade merchandising support and
consumer dollars. As such, the number of competitors cannot be reliably
estimated. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, quality,
price, advertising, promotion and service.

Working Capital

For information relating to the company’s cash and other working capital items,
see pages 19 through 29 of the company’s 2003 Annual Report in the section
entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition,” which are incorporated herein by reference.

Research And Development

During the last three fiscal years, the company’s expenditures on research
activities relating to new products and the improvement and maintenance of
existing products were approximately $88 million in 2003, $79 million in 2002
and $64 million in 2001. The increase in research and development spending in
2003 is consistent with the previously announced investment initiatives. The
company conducts this research primarily at its headquarters in Camden, New
Jersey, although important research is also undertaken in various other
locations inside and outside the United States.

Environmental Matters

The company has programs for the operation and design of its facilities that
meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations. The company’s
capital expenditures during fiscal 2003 were approximately $283 million, of
which approximately $7.6 million was for compliance with environmental laws and
regulations in the United States. The company further estimates that
approximately $6 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during fiscal
2004 will be for compliance with such environmental laws and regulations. The
company believes that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and
regulations will not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings,
or the competitive position of the company. Additional information regarding
the company’s environmental matters is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of this
report on pages 9 and 10 under the heading “Legal Proceedings.”

Employees

At August 3, 2003, there were
approximately 25,000 full-time employees of the
company.

Financial Information

For information with respect to revenue, operating profitability and
identifiable assets attributable to the company’s business segments and
geographic areas, see pages 37 through 38 of the 2003 Annual Report in the
section of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements entitled “Business
and Geographic Segment Information,” which are incorporated herein by
reference.


Company Website

The company’s primary website can be found at www.campbellsoup.com. The
company makes available free of charge at this website (under the “Investor
Center – Financial Reports – SEC Financial Reports” caption) all of its reports
filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, including its annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q and its Current Reports on Form 8-K. These reports are
made available on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after their
filing with, or furnishing to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Cautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results

From time to time, the company makes oral and written statements that reflect
the company’s current expectations regarding future results of operations,
economic performance, financial condition and achievements of the company. The
company tries, wherever possible, to identify these forward looking statements
by using words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “will”
and similar expressions. One can also identify them by the fact that they do
not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements reflect
the company’s current plans and expectations and are based on information
currently available to it. They rely on a number of assumptions regarding
future events and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are inherently
subject to risks and uncertainties.

The company wishes to caution the reader that the following important factors
and those important factors described in other Securities and Exchange
Commission filings of the company, or in the company’s 2003 Annual Report,
could affect the company’s actual results and could cause such results to vary
materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of, the company:


customer inventory levels and access to shelf space;

•

the impact of fluctuations in the supply and cost of raw materials;

•

the impact of unforeseen economic changes in currency exchange rates,
tax rates, interest rates, equity markets, inflation rates, recession
and other external factors over which the company has no control,
including the possibility of increased pension expense and contributions
resulting from lower interest rates and declines in stock market
returns; and

•

the impact of unforeseen business disruptions in one or more of the
company’s markets due to political instability, civil disobedience,
armed hostilities or other calamities.

This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to
highlight important factors that may impact the company’s outlook. The company
disclaims any obligation or intent to update any forward-looking statements
made by the company in order to reflect new information, events or
circumstances after the date they are made.


Item 2. Properties

The company’s principal executive offices and main research facilities are
company-owned and located in Camden, New Jersey. The following table sets
forth the company’s principal manufacturing facilities:

Principal Manufacturing Facilities

Each of the foregoing manufacturing facilities is company-owned, except that
the Utrecht, Netherlands facility, the Woodinville, Washington facility, the
Scoresby, Australia facility and portions of the Ashford, United Kingdom
facility are subject to leases. The company also operates retail confectionery
shops in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia; retail bakery thrift
stores in the United States; and other plants, facilities and offices at
various locations in the United States and abroad, including additional
executive offices in Norwalk, Connecticut; Cambourne, United Kingdom; Paris,
France; and Homebush, Australia.

Management believes that the company’s manufacturing and processing plants are
well maintained and are generally adequate to support the current operations of
the businesses.


Item 3. Legal Proceedings

As previously reported, ten purported class action lawsuits were commenced
against the company and two of its former executives in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey. The lawsuits were subsequently
consolidated, and an amended consolidated complaint was filed alleging, among
other things, that the company and the former executives misrepresented the
company’s financial condition between September 8, 1997 and January 8, 1999, by
failing to disclose alleged shipping and revenue recognition practices in
connection with the sale of certain company products at the end of the
company’s fiscal quarters in violation of Section 10 (b) and 20 (a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated
thereunder. On February 6, 2003, the company announced it had reached an
agreement in principle to settle this case. The district court’s order
approving the settlement was issued on May 22, 2003 and became effective June
23, 2003. Pursuant to the court’s order, all claims have been dismissed and
the litigation has been terminated in exchange for a payment of $35 million,
which was made in June 2003. The full amount of the payment was covered by
insurance. The settlement does not constitute an admission of fault or
liability by the company or any other defendant.

As also previously reported, on March 30, 1998, the company effected a spinoff
of several of its non-core businesses to Vlasic Foods International Inc.
(“VFI”). VFI and several of its affiliates (collectively, “Vlasic”) commenced
cases under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 29, 2001 in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Vlasic’s Second Amended
Joint Plan of Distribution under Chapter 11 (the “Plan”) was confirmed by an
order of the Bankruptcy Court dated November 16, 2001, and became effective on
or about November 29, 2001. The Plan provides for the assignment of various
causes of action allegedly belonging to the Vlasic estates, including claims
against the company allegedly arising from the spinoff, to VFB L.L.C., a
limited liability company (“VFB”) whose membership interests are to be
distributed under the Plan to Vlasic’s general unsecured creditors.

On February 19, 2002, VFB commenced a lawsuit against the company and several
of its subsidiaries in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware alleging, among other things, fraudulent conveyance, illegal dividends
and breaches of fiduciary duty by Vlasic directors alleged to be under the
company’s control. The lawsuit seeks to hold the company liable in an amount
necessary to satisfy all unpaid claims against Vlasic (which VFB estimates in
the amended complaint to be $200 million), plus unspecified exemplary and
punitive damages. While this case is still in the discovery stage and the
ultimate disposition of complex litigation is inherently difficult to assess,
the company believes the action is without merit and is defending the case
vigorously.

As also previously reported, the company received an Examination Report from
the Internal Revenue Service on December 23, 2002, which included a challenge
to the treatment of gains and interest deductions claimed in the company’s
fiscal 1995 federal income tax return, relating to transactions involving
government securities. If the proposed adjustment were upheld, it would
require the company to pay a net amount of approximately $100 million in taxes,
accumulated interest to date, and penalties. Interest will continue to accrue
until the matter is resolved. The company believes these transactions were
properly reported on its federal income tax return in accordance with
applicable tax laws and regulations in effect during the period involved and is
challenging these adjustments vigorously. While the outcome of proceedings of
this type cannot be predicted with certainty, the company believes that the
ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on the
consolidated financial condition or results of operation of the company.

As also previously reported, in April 2003, the company began discussions with
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”) regarding
certain air emissions from the


company’s South Plainfield, New Jersey flavoring and spice mix plant. These
emissions may exceed limits established pursuant to the New Jersey Air
Pollution Control Act. The discussions are likely to result in the company
installing air emission control equipment on an agreed upon schedule. The
NJDEP may require additional expenditures, which can not be determined at this
time. As of August 31, 2003, the company incurred costs of approximately $120
thousand related to the evaluation of this issue, and the company expects to
spend up to $1 million (exclusive of any other amounts) on the installation of
required air emissions control equipment. The company does not expect that the
cost of installing the emission control equipment or any other expenditures
required by the NJDEP will have a material impact on the consolidated financial
condition or results of operation of the company.

In July 2003, the company began discussions with the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources (“WDNR”) regarding certain air emissions from the company’s
Milwaukee, Wisconsin flavoring and spice mix plant. These emissions may exceed
limits established pursuant to the Wisconsin Clean Air Act Program. The
discussions are likely to result in the company installing air emission control
equipment on an agreed upon schedule. The WDNR may require additional
expenditures, which can not be determined at this time. As of August 31, 2003,
the company incurred costs of approximately $42 thousand related to the
evaluation of this issue, and the company expects to spend up to $1 million
(exclusive of any other amounts) on the installation of required air emissions
control equipment. The company does not expect that the cost of installing the
emission control equipment or any other expenditures required by the WDNR will
have a material impact on the consolidated financial condition or results of
operation of the company.

On July 15, 2003, Pepperidge Farm, Incorporated, an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of the company, made a submission to the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) relating to its use and replacement of certain
appliances containing ozone-depleting refrigerants. The submission was made
pursuant to the terms of the Ozone-Depleting Substance Emission Reduction
Bakery Partnership Agreement (the “EPA Agreement”) entered into by and between
Pepperidge Farm and the EPA. Pepperidge Farm executed the EPA Agreement in
April 2002 as part of a voluntary EPA-sponsored program relating to the
reduction of ozone-depleting refrigerants used in the bakery industry. As a
result of the EPA Agreement, as of August 31, 2003, Pepperidge Farm has
incurred costs of approximately $4 million relating to the evaluation and
replacement of certain of its refrigerant appliances. If the submission is
approved by the EPA, in addition to the expenditures previously made,
Pepperidge Farm will be required to (i) pay a penalty in the amount of
approximately $362 thousand, and (ii) replace certain additional refrigerant
appliances, which Pepperidge Farm expects to cost approximately $750 thousand.
The company does not expect that the cost of complying with the EPA Agreement
will have a material impact on the consolidated financial condition or results
of operation of the company.
