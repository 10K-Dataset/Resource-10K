PART I

Item 1.

Business

The
    Company

Campbell Soup Company (“Campbell” or the
    “company”), together with its consolidated
    subsidiaries, is a global manufacturer and marketer of
    high-quality, branded convenience food products. Campbell was
    incorporated as a business corporation under the laws of New
    Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through predecessor
    organizations, it traces its heritage in the food business back
    to 1869. The company’s principal executive offices are in
    Camden, New Jersey

08103-1799.

In fiscal 2008, the company continued its focus on achieving
    long-term sustainable sales and earnings growth by executing
    against the following seven key strategies:

•

Expanding the company’s icon brands within simple meals,
    baked snacks and healthy beverages;

•

Trading consumers up to higher levels of satisfaction centering
    on wellness, quality and convenience;

•

Making the company’s products more broadly available in
    existing and new markets;

•

Strengthening the company’s business through outside
    partnerships and acquisitions;

•

Increasing margins by improving price realization and
    company-wide productivity;

•

Improving overall organizational excellence, diversity,
    engagement and innovation; and

•

Advancing a powerful commitment to sustainability and corporate
    social responsibility.

Consistent with these strategies, the company has undertaken
    several portfolio adjustments. The company divested its Godiva
    Chocolatier business on March 18, 2008 and certain
    Australian salty snack food brands and assets on May 12,
    2008. On July 31, 2008, the company announced that it had
    entered into an agreement to divest its French sauce and
    mayonnaise business, which is marketed under the

Lesieur

brand. The sale of the French sauce and mayonnaise business
    was completed on September 29, 2008. These portfolio
    adjustments are designed to enhance the company’s focus on
    the core simple meals, baked snacks and healthy beverages
    businesses in markets with the greatest potential for growth.
    For additional information relating to the company’s seven
    key strategies, see “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”

Prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the company’s
    operations were organized and reported in the following
    segments: U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages; Baking and
    Snacking; International Soup, Sauces and Beverages; and Other.
    Other included the Godiva Chocolatier business and the
    company’s Away From Home operations. As of the second
    quarter of fiscal 2008, the results of the Godiva Chocolatier
    business were reported as discontinued operations for the
    periods presented due to the previously discussed divestiture.
    See Note 3 for additional information on the sale.
    Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Away From
    Home business was reported as North America Foodservice.

The segments are discussed in greater detail below.

U.S.
    Soup, Sauces and Beverages

The U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment includes the
    following retail businesses:

Campbell’s

    frozen products in U.S. retail;

Arnott’s

biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific; and

Arnott’s

salty snacks in


Australia. As previously discussed, in May 2008, the company
    completed the divestiture of certain salty snack food brands and
    assets in Australia, which were historically included in this
    segment.

International
    Soup, Sauces and Beverages

The International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment includes
    the soup, sauce and beverage businesses outside of the United
    States, including Europe, Mexico, Latin America, the Asia
    Pacific region and the retail business in Canada. The
    segment’s operations include

Erasco

and

Heisse
    Tasse

soups in Germany,

Liebig

and

Royco

soups
    in France,

Devos Lemmens

mayonnaise and cold sauces and

Campbell’s

and

Royco

soups in Belgium, and

Blå Band

soups and sauces in Sweden. In Asia
    Pacific, operations include

Campbell’s

soup and
    stock,

Swanson

broths and

V8

beverages. In Canada,
    operations include

Habitant

and

Campbell’s

soups,

Prego

pasta sauce,

V8

beverages and certain
    Pepperidge Farm products. The French sauce and mayonnaise
    business, which was marketed under the

Lesieur

brand and
    divested on September 29, 2008, was historically included
    in this segment.

North
    America Foodservice

The North America Foodservice segment includes the
    company’s Away From Home operations, which represent the
    distribution of products such as soup, specialty entrees,
    beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm
    products through various food service channels in the United
    States and Canada.

Ingredients

The ingredients required for the manufacture of the
    company’s food products are purchased from various
    suppliers. While all such ingredients are available from
    numerous independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to
    fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors,
    including changes in crop size, cattle cycles, product scarcity,
    demand for raw materials, energy costs, government-sponsored
    agricultural programs, import and export requirements and
    weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons. To
    help reduce some of this volatility, the company uses various
    commodity risk management tools for a number of its ingredients
    and commodities, such as soybean oil, wheat, soybean meal, corn,
    cocoa and natural gas. Ingredient inventories are at a peak
    during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring.
    Since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in
    sufficient quantities only at certain seasons, the company makes
    commitments for the purchase of such ingredients during their
    respective seasons. At this time, the company does not
    anticipate any material restrictions on availability or
    shortages of ingredients that would have a significant impact on
    the company’s businesses. For additional information on the
    impact of inflation on the company, see “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition.”

Customers

In most of the company’s markets, sales activities are
    conducted by the company’s own sales force and through
    broker and distributor arrangements. In the United States,
    Canada and Latin America, the company’s products are
    generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass
    discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience
    stores, drug stores and other retail, commercial and
    non-commercial establishments. In Europe, the company’s
    products are generally resold to consumers in retail food
    chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores,
    convenience stores and other retail, commercial and
    non-commercial establishments. In Mexico, the company’s
    products are generally resold to consumers in retail food
    chains, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores,
    drug stores and other retail establishments. In the Asia Pacific
    region, the company’s products are generally resold to
    consumers through retail food chains, convenience stores and
    other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. The
    company makes shipments promptly after receipt and acceptance of
    orders.

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and
    its affiliates, accounted for approximately 16% of the
    company’s consolidated net sales during fiscal 2008 and 15%
    during fiscal 2007. All of the company’s segments sold
    products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates. No other
    customer accounted for 10% or more of the company’s
    consolidated net sales.



Trademarks
    And Technology

As of September 15, 2008, the company owned over 4,400
    trademark registrations and applications in over 150 countries
    and believes that its trademarks are of material importance to
    its business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks
    generally are valid as long as they are in use

and/or

their
    registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to
    have become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be
    renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. The
    company believes that its principal brands, including

Campbell’s,

Erasco,

Liebig,

Pepperidge Farm,

V8,

Pace,

Prego,

Swanson,

and

Arnott’s,

are protected by
    trademark law in the company’s relevant major markets. In
    addition, some of the company’s products are sold under
    brands that have been licensed from third parties.

Although the company owns a number of valuable patents, it does
    not regard any segment of its business as being dependent upon
    any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, the
    company owns copyrights, both registered and unregistered, and
    proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and
    other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Competition

The company experiences worldwide competition in all of its
    principal products. This competition arises from numerous
    competitors of varying sizes, including producers of generic and
    private label products, as well as from manufacturers of other
    branded food products, which compete for trade merchandising
    support and consumer dollars. As such, the number of competitors
    cannot be reliably estimated. The principal areas of competition
    are brand recognition, quality, price, advertising, promotion,
    convenience and service.

Working
    Capital

For information relating to the company’s cash and working
    capital items, see “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”

Capital
    Expenditures

During fiscal 2008, the company’s aggregate capital
    expenditures were $298 million. The company expects to
    spend approximately $400 million for capital projects in
    fiscal 2009. The anticipated major fiscal 2009 capital projects
    include the previously announced expansion and enhancement of
    the company’s corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey,
    which is expected to continue into fiscal years following 2009,
    and expansion of the company’s beverage production capacity.

Research
    And Development

During the last three fiscal years, the company’s
    expenditures on research activities relating to new products and
    the improvement and maintenance of existing products for
    continuing operations were $115 million in 2008,
    $111 million in 2007 and $103 million in 2006. The
    increase from 2007 to 2008 was primarily due to the impact of
    currency. The increase from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to
    expenses related to new product development, higher incentive
    compensation costs and the impact of currency. The company
    conducts this research primarily at its headquarters in Camden,
    New Jersey, although important research is undertaken at various
    other locations inside and outside the United States.

Environmental
    Matters

The company has requirements for the operation and design of its
    facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules
    and regulations. Of the company’s $298 million in
    capital expenditures made during fiscal 2008, approximately
    $6 million was for compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations in the United States. The company further estimates
    that approximately $7 million of the capital expenditures
    anticipated during fiscal 2009 will be for compliance with
    United States environmental laws and regulations. The company
    believes that continued compliance with existing environmental
    laws and regulations will not have a material effect on capital
    expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the
    company.



Seasonality

Demand for the company’s products is somewhat seasonal,
    with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the
    highest sales volume due primarily to demand for the
    company’s soup and sauce products. Demand for the
    company’s beverage, baking and snacking products, however,
    is generally evenly distributed throughout the year.

Regulation

The manufacture and marketing of food products is highly
    regulated. In the United States, the company is subject to
    regulation by various government agencies, including the Food
    and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
    and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as various state and
    local agencies. The company is also regulated by similar
    agencies outside the United States and by voluntary
    organizations such as the National Advertising Division and the
    Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative of the
    Council of Better Business Bureaus.

Employees

On August 3, 2008, there were approximately
    19,400 employees of the company.

Financial
    Information

    and identifiable assets attributable to the company’s

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report,
    the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely
    affect the company’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known to the company or that the company currently
    deems immaterial also may impair the company’s business
    operations and financial condition.

The
    company operates in a highly competitive industry

The company operates in the highly competitive food industry and
    experiences worldwide competition in all of its principal
    products. A number of the company’s primary competitors
    have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. A
    strong competitive response from one or more of these
    competitors to the company’s marketplace efforts, or a
    consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in
    the company reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other
    expenditures, or losing market share. These changes may have a
    material adverse effect on the business and financial results of
    the company.

The
    company’s results may be adversely impacted by increases in
    the price of raw and packaging materials

The raw and packaging materials used in the company’s
    business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry,
    vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these
    materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of
    factors, including product scarcity, demand for raw materials,
    commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency
    fluctuations, weather conditions, import and export requirements
    and changes in government-sponsored agricultural programs. To
    the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and
    packaging material prices,



the company may not be able to offset such increases through
    productivity or price increases. In such cases, the
    company’s business or financial results could be negatively
    impacted.

The
    company’s results are dependent on successful marketplace
    initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the company’s
    products

The company’s results are dependent on successful
    marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the
    company’s products. The company’s product
    introductions and product improvements, along with its other
    marketplace initiatives, are designed to capitalize on new
    customer or consumer trends. In order to remain successful, the
    company must anticipate and react to these new trends and
    develop new products or processes to address them. While the
    company devotes significant resources to meeting this goal, the
    company may not be successful in developing new products or
    processes, or its new products or processes may not be accepted
    by customers or consumers. These results could have a material
    adverse effect on the business and financial results of the
    company.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by the increased significance
    of some of its customers

The disruption of supply to any of the company’s large
    customers, such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., for an extended period
    of time could adversely affect the company’s business or
    financial results. In addition, the retail grocery trade
    continues to consolidate, and mass market retailers continue to
    become larger. In such an environment, large retail customers
    may attempt to increase their profitability by seeking lower
    prices or increased promotional programs funded by their
    suppliers. If the company is unable to use its scale, marketing
    expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions
    to respond to these customer demands, the company’s
    business or financial results could be negatively impacted.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or failure
    of, its information technology systems

Each year the company engages in several billion dollars of
    transactions with its customers and vendors. Because the amount
    of dollars involved is so significant, the company’s
    information technology resources must provide connections among
    its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer
    service, and accounting functions. If the company does not
    allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build
    and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure and to
    maintain the related computerized and manual control processes,
    the company’s business or financial results could be
    negatively impacted.

The
    company may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost
    savings or benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information
    technology or other initiatives

The company’s success is partly dependent upon properly
    executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from,
    its ongoing supply chain, information technology and other
    initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make
    the company more efficient in the manufacture and distribution
    of its products, which is necessary in the company’s highly
    competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a
    failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not
    meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an
    interruption to the company’s sales, manufacturing,
    logistics, customer service or accounting functions. Any of
    these results could have a material adverse effect on the
    business and financial results of the company.

Disruption
    to the company’s supply chain could adversely affect its
    business

Damage or disruption to the company’s suppliers or to the
    company’s manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to
    weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes,
    or other reasons could impair the company’s ability to
    manufacture

and/or

sell
    its products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the
    likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively
    manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is
    sourced from a single location, could adversely affect the
    company’s business or financial results.



The
    company may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully
    execute acquisitions and divestitures

From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or
    divestitures. The success of any such acquisition or divestiture
    depends, in part, upon the company’s ability to identify
    suitable buyers or sellers, negotiate favorable contractual
    terms and, in many cases, obtain governmental approval. For
    acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently
    integrating the acquired business into the company’s
    existing operations. In cases where acquisitions or divestitures
    are not successfully implemented or completed, the
    company’s business or financial results could be negatively
    impacted.

The
    company’s results may be impacted negatively by political
    and/or economic conditions in the United States or other
    nations

The company is a global manufacturer and marketer of
    high-quality, branded convenience food products. Because of its
    global reach, the company’s performance may be impacted
    negatively by political

and/or

economic conditions in the United States, as well as other
    nations. A change in any one or more of the following factors in
    the United States, or in other nations, could impact the
    company: currency exchange rates, tax rates, interest rates,
    legal or regulatory requirements, tariffs, export and import
    restrictions or equity markets. The company may also be impacted
    by recession, political instability, civil disobedience, armed
    hostilities, natural disasters and terrorist acts in the United
    States or throughout the world. Any one of the foregoing could
    have a material adverse effect on the business and financial
    results of the company.

If the
    company’s food products become adulterated or are
    mislabeled, the company might need to recall those items and may
    experience product liability claims if consumers are
    injured

The company may need to recall some of its products if they
    become adulterated or if they are mislabeled. The company may
    also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes
    injury. A widespread product recall could result in significant
    losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product
    inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product
    for a period of time. The company could also suffer losses from
    a significant product liability judgment against it. A
    significant product recall or product liability case could also
    result in adverse publicity, damage to the company’s
    reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the
    company’s food products, which could have a material
    adverse effect on the business and financial results of the
    company.

    as part of the divestiture of their respective businesses. The
    Dunkirk, France, facility was sold as part of the company’s
    divestiture of the

Lesieur

branded sauce and mayonnaise
    business, which was completed on September 29, 2008. The
    Gerwisch, Germany, facility was closed during fiscal 2008. The
    company expects to close the Listowel, Canada, and the Miranda,
    Australia, facilities in fiscal 2009.

Management believes that the company’s manufacturing and
    processing plants are well maintained and are generally adequate
    to support the current operations of the businesses.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition

Overview

Description
    of the Company

Campbell Soup Company is a global manufacturer and marketer of
    high-quality, branded convenience food products. Prior to the
    second quarter of fiscal 2008, the company’s operations
    were organized and reported in the following segments:
    U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages; Baking and Snacking;
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages; and Other. Other
    included the Godiva Chocolatier worldwide business and the
    company’s Away From Home operations. As of the second
    quarter of fiscal 2008, the results of the Godiva Chocolatier
    business were reported as discontinued operations for the
    periods presented due to the divestiture of the business.
    Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Away From
    Home business was reported as North America Foodservice. See
    Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information on segments.

The company’s well-known brands are sold in approximately
    120 countries. Its principal geographies are North America,
    France, Germany, Belgium, and Australia.

Key
    Strategies

To achieve its financial goal of long-term sustainable sales and
    earnings growth, the company is focused on executing seven
    strategies:

1. expand its icon brands within simple meals, baked snacks
    and healthy beverages;

2. trade consumers up to higher levels of satisfaction
    centering on wellness, quality and convenience;

3. make its products more broadly available in existing and
    new markets;

4. strengthen its business through outside partnerships and
    acquisitions;

5. increase margins by improving price realization and
    company-wide productivity;

6. improve overall organizational excellence, diversity,
    engagement, and innovation; and

7. advance a powerful commitment to sustainability and
    corporate social responsibility.

Expand the company’s icon brands within simple meals,
    baked snacks and healthy beverages.

The
    company’s overarching business strategy is focused on
    driving profitable growth in three large, global
    categories — simple meals, baked snacks, and healthy
    beverages — that are well aligned with consumer
    trends, and are growing in most of the markets in which the
    company does business. Principal brands in these core categories
    include

Campbell’s, Swanson, Pace, Liebig, Erasco,
    Pepperidge Farm, Goldfish, Arnott’s,

and

V8.

The
    company



has strong market positions in the segments within these
    categories in the geographies in which it competes, and its
    businesses in these categories respond well to product
    innovation and consumer support.

Recent portfolio changes have been intended to enhance the
    company’s focus in these three core categories, in markets
    with the greatest potential for growth. In fiscal 2008, the
    company announced the divestiture of the Godiva Chocolatier
    business, which was completed in the third quarter of the fiscal
    year, and the divestiture of certain salty snack food brands and
    assets in Australia, which was completed in the fourth fiscal
    quarter. The company also announced the divestiture of its sauce
    and mayonnaise business in France marketed under the

Lesieur

brand, which was completed on September 29, 2008.

Trade consumers up to higher levels of satisfaction centering
    on wellness, quality and convenience.

Within its
    core categories, the company is focused on meeting the demand
    for products that respond to growing consumer interest in health
    and nutrition, quality and convenience. In the past two years,
    the company introduced new and reformulated condensed and

ready-to-serve

soups with reduced sodium in the U.S., Canada, Australia and
    Europe. In fiscal 2008, it introduced

Campbell’s Select
    Harvest

soups, a new line of

ready-to-serve

soups with lower sodium, and a line of 100% vegetable soups in
    aseptic packaging marketed under the

V8

brand. Responding
    to consumer interest in weight management, in fiscal 2008 the
    company also introduced

Campbell’s Select Harvest

Light soups and other lower calorie offerings. In the
    category of baked snacks, the company expanded the health
    credentials of its product lines through the introduction of

Pepperidge Farm

whole-grain breads, rolls and bagels and
    whole-grain

Arnott’s Vita-Weat

biscuits. It also
    expanded its healthy beverage portfolio with new varieties of

V8 V-Fusion

vegetable and fruit juice, a fast-growing
    extension of the

V8

vegetable juice franchise. In the
    convenience arena, the company continues to focus on
    single-serve microwavable soups in North America, Europe and
    Australia, portable packages of cookie and cracker products, and
    merchandising innovations, such as gravity-feed shelving, that
    enhance the convenience of the shopping experience for the
    consumer.

Make the company’s products more broadly available in
    existing and new markets.

The company is pursuing
    strategies designed to expand the availability of its products
    in existing markets and to capitalize on opportunities in
    emerging channels and markets around the globe. In North
    America, for example, it is developing distribution in
    convenience and other channels through its agreement with The

Coca-Cola

Company and

Coca-Cola

Enterprises Inc. for the distribution of refrigerated
    single-serve beverages. To realize the potential of emerging
    markets, the company is implementing its previously announced
    plans to establish soup businesses in Russia and the
    People’s Republic of China.

Strengthen the company’s business through outside
    partnerships and acquisitions.

In fiscal 2008,
    the company announced a new commitment to enhance sales and
    earnings growth through value-creating external development. In
    July 2008, it acquired the existing Wolfgang Puck U.S. soup
    business and entered into a license agreement for the

Wolfgang Puck

brand on soup, stock and broth products in
    North America retail locations.

Wolfgang Puck

is one of
    the leading organic soup brands in the U.S.

Increase margins by improving price realization and
    company-wide productivity.

The company remains
    focused on increasing margins though a combination of pricing
    and productivity improvements that are intended to cover cost
    increases and build margins over time. In April 2008, it
    announced a series of initiatives designed to improve
    operational efficiency and long-term profitability, including
    (i) plans for the closure of its plant in Listowel,
    Ontario, Canada; (ii) the sale of certain salty snack food
    brands and assets in Australia; (iii) plans for the
    discontinuation of private label biscuit and industrial
    chocolate production at the company’s Miranda, Australia
    facility, and the closure of the facility; and
    (iv) streamlining of the company’s management
    structure.

Improve overall organizational excellence, diversity,
    engagement and innovation.

The company remains
    committed to building a diverse and engaged workforce that is
    focused on excellence and innovation. Its efforts span three
    primary areas: (1) capabilities, including improving
    skills, innovation capabilities, and manager and team
    effectiveness; (2) culture, including values, workplace
    flexibility and employee wellness, and (3) human resources
    infrastructure, including processes and technology. Ensuring an
    effective, motivated, inclusive and diverse workplace will be
    the foundation of all organizational initiatives. The company
    will continue to use annual employee surveys to assess its
    progress in building employee satisfaction and engagement.

Advance a powerful commitment to sustainability and corporate
    social responsibility.

In August 2008, the
    company affirmed its commitment to corporate social
    responsibility and environmental sustainability and issued its



first corporate social responsibility report, “Nourishing
    People’s Lives,” which describes the company’s
    strategies, policies, programs and initiatives. The report
    focuses on four areas of primary importance to the
    company’s stakeholders: Campbell’s consumers; the
    planet; Campbell’s employees; and Campbell’s
    communities.

Basis
    of Presentation

On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its
    Godiva Chocolatier business for $850 million, pursuant to a
    Sale and Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The
    purchase price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments,
    which resulted in an additional $20 million of proceeds.
    The company has reflected the results of this business as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    earnings for all years presented. The company used approximately
    $600 million of the net proceeds to purchase company stock.
    See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

In the third quarter of 2008, the company entered into an
    agreement to sell certain Australian salty snack food brands and
    assets. The transaction, which was completed on May 12,
    2008, included salty snack brands such as

Cheezels,

Thins,

Tasty Jacks,

French Fries,

and

Kettle Chips,

certain other assets and the assumption of
    liabilities. Proceeds of the sale were nominal. The business had
    annual net sales of approximately $150 million. This
    transaction is included in the restructuring initiatives
    described in Note 7.

In July 2008, the company entered into an agreement to sell its
    sauce and mayonnaise business comprised of products sold under
    the

Lesieur

brand in France. The business had annual net
    sales of approximately $70 million. The assets and
    liabilities of this business were reflected as assets and
    liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as
    of August 3, 2008. The sale was completed on
    September 29, 2008. See Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional information.

In June 2008, the company acquired the Wolfgang Puck soup
    business from Country Gourmet Foods for approximately
    $10 million of which approximately $1 million will be
    paid in the next two years. The company also entered into a
    master licensing agreement with Wolfgang Puck Worldwide, Inc.
    for the use of the

Wolfgang Puck

brand on soup, stock,
    and broth products in North America retail locations. This
    business is included in the U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages
    segment. The business had annual sales of approximately
    $20 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information.

On August 15, 2006, the company completed the sale of its
    businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland for
    £460 million, or approximately $870 million,
    pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated July 12,
    2006. The United Kingdom and Ireland businesses included

Homepride

sauces,

OXO

stock cubes,

Batchelors

soups and

McDonnells

and

Erin

soups. The
    purchase price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments,
    which resulted in an additional $19 million of proceeds.
    The company has reflected the results of these businesses as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    earnings for all years presented. The company used approximately
    $620 million of the net proceeds to purchase company stock.
    See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

In June 2007, the company completed the sale of its ownership
    interest in Papua New Guinea operations for approximately
    $23 million. This business had annual sales of
    approximately $20 million.

Results
    of Operations


Net earnings were $1,165 million in 2008 ($3.06 per share)
    and $854 million ($2.16 per share) in 2007. (All earnings
    per share amounts included in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis are presented on a diluted basis.)

The following items impacted the comparability of net earnings
    and net earnings per share:

Continuing
    Operations

•

In fiscal 2008, the company recorded a pre-tax restructuring
    charge of $175 million ($102 million after tax or $.27

    with initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term
    profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands
    and assets in



Australia, closing certain production facilities in Australia
    and Canada, and streamlining the company’s management
    structure. In addition, in connection with these initiatives,
    the company recorded $7 million ($5 million after tax
    or $.01 per share) of accelerated depreciation in Cost of
    products sold. The aggregate impact was $182 million
    ($107 million after tax or $.28 per share). See Note 7

•

In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the company recorded a
    pre-tax non-cash benefit of $20 million ($13 million
    after tax or $.03 per share) in earnings from continuing
    operations from the reversal of legal reserves due to favorable
    results in litigation;

•

In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the company recorded a tax
    benefit of $22 million resulting from the settlement of
    bilateral advance pricing agreements (“APA”) among the
    company, the United States, and Canada related to royalties. In
    addition, the company reduced net interest expense by
    $4 million ($3 million after tax). The aggregate
    impact on earnings from continuing operations was
    $25 million or $.06 per share; and

•

In the second quarter of 2007, the company recorded a pre-tax
    gain of $23 million ($14 million after tax or $.04 per

Earnings from continuing operations were $671 million in
    2008 ($1.76 per share) and $792 million
    ($2.00 per share) in 2007.

After factoring in the items impacting comparability, earnings
    from continuing operations increased primarily due to higher
    sales, productivity improvements, the impact of currency and the
    benefit of the

rd

week, partially offset by a reduction of gross margin as a
    percentage of sales and a higher effective tax rate. The
    additional week contributed approximately $.02 per share to
    earnings from continuing operations in 2008. Earnings per share
    from continuing operations also benefited from a reduction in
    weighted average diluted shares outstanding.

Earnings from discontinued operations were $494 million in
    2008 ($1.30 per share) and $62 million ($.16 per share) in
    2007. After factoring items impacting comparability, earnings at
    Godiva increased slightly.


Earnings from continuing operations were $792 million
    ($2.00 per share) in 2007 and $720 million ($1.74 per
    share) in 2006.

In addition to the 2007 items that impacted the comparability of
    Earnings from continuing operations and Earnings per share from
    continuing operations, the following items also impacted
    comparability:

•

In the first quarter of 2006, a $13 million pre-tax gain
    was recognized due to a change in the method of accounting for
    certain U.S. inventories from the LIFO method to the
    average cost method. The impact on Earnings from continuing
    operations was $8 million ($.02 per share). Prior periods
    were not restated since the impact of the change on previously
    issued financial statements was not considered material. (See
    Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);

•

In the first quarter of 2006, the company recorded a non-cash
    tax benefit of $47 million resulting from the favorable
    resolution of a U.S. tax contingency related to
    transactions in government securities in a prior period. In
    addition, the company reduced interest expense and accrued
    interest payable by $21 million and adjusted deferred tax
    expense by $8 million ($13 million after tax). The
    aggregate non-cash impact of the settlement on Earnings from
    continuing operations was $60 million, or $.14 per share.
    (See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);

•

In 2006, incremental tax expense of $13 million ($.03 per
    share) was recognized associated with incremental dividends of
    $294 million as the company finalized its plan to
    repatriate earnings from

non-U.S. subsidiaries

under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the
    AJCA); and

•

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the company recorded a deferred
    tax benefit of $14 million ($.03 per share) from the
    anticipated use of higher levels of foreign tax credits, which
    could be utilized as a result of the sale of the company’s
    United Kingdom and Ireland businesses in August 2006.

The sum of the individual per share amounts does not equal due
    to rounding.

In addition, the comparability of Earnings per share from
    continuing operations was impacted by the use of proceeds from
    the sale of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses in the
    first quarter of 2007. During the first quarter of 2007, the
    company completed its previously announced program utilizing
    $620 million of the net proceeds to repurchase shares. The
    impact in 2007 of utilizing those proceeds to repurchase shares
    and reduce shares outstanding in the calculation of Earnings per
    share from continuing operations was a benefit of approximately
    $.07 in Earnings per share from continuing operations.

The remaining increase in Earnings from continuing operations in
    2007 from 2006 was primarily due to an increase in sales, a
    higher gross margin as a percentage of sales, and lower net
    interest expense, partially offset by increased marketing
    expenses and a higher effective tax rate.

In 2008, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased
    5%. As reported, U.S. soup sales increased 2% as condensed
    soup sales increased 1%,

ready-to-serve

soup sales increased 1%, and broth sales increased 12%.
    Excluding the benefit of the

rd

week, U.S. soup sales increased 1% as condensed soup sales
    were flat,

ready-to-serve

soup sales increased 1%, and broth sales increased 11%. Within
    condensed soup, gains in cooking varieties were offset by
    declines in eating varieties. In

ready-to-serve,

sales gains in

Campbell’s Chunky

and

Campbell’s Select

canned soups were partially offset
    by a decline in the convenience platform, which includes soups
    in microwavable bowls and cups. Condensed and

ready-to-serve

soups benefited from the lower sodium varieties.

Swanson

broth sales increased due to continued growth of
    aseptically-packaged varieties. Excluding the impact of the

rd

week, beverage sales increased double digits, primarily due to
    consumer demand for healthy beverages.

V8

vegetable
    juice,

V8 V-Fusion

vegetable and fruit juice, and

V8
    Splash

juice drinks contributed to the sales growth. Sales
    of

Campbell’s

tomato juice declined. Beverage sales
    benefited from expanded distribution of single-serve beverages
    due to the distribution agreement for refrigerated single-serve
    beverages with The

Coca-Cola

Company and

Coca-Cola

Enterprises Inc. Sales of

Prego

pasta sauces and

Pace

Mexican sauces increased.

In 2007, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased
    7%. U.S. soup sales increased 5% as condensed soup sales
    increased 3%,

ready-to-serve

soup sales increased 5% and broth sales increased 12%. The
    introduction in 2007 of new lower sodium varieties of condensed
    and

ready-to-serve

soups contributed to the sales growth. Within condensed soup,
    both eating and cooking varieties delivered solid sales gains.
    Sales growth in

ready-to-serve

soup was driven by gains in

Campbell’s Chunky

and

Campbell’s Select

soups which benefited from higher
    levels of advertising. In the convenience platform, which
    includes soups in microwavable bowls and cups, sales grew double
    digits.

Swanson

broth sales grew due to increased
    advertising and continued growth of aseptically-packaged
    products. Beverage sales grew significantly as

V8

vegetable juice and

V8 V-Fusion

vegetable and fruit
    juice, introduced in the second quarter of 2006, responded
    favorably to new advertising campaigns and increased levels of
    advertising

. V8 Splash

juice drinks also experienced
    sales growth. Sales of

Prego

pasta sauces and

Pace

Mexican sauces increased.



In 2008, Baking and Snacking sales increased 11%. Excluding the
    impact of the

rd

week, Pepperidge Farm sales increased with growth in all
    businesses: cookies and crackers, bakery, and frozen. The sales
    increase in the cookies and crackers business was primarily due
    to the growth of

Pepperidge Farm Goldfish

snack crackers,
    the launch of Baked Naturals, a line of adult savory snack
    crackers, and growth in Distinctive cookie varieties. Bakery
    sales increased driven by gains in whole-grain varieties and
    sandwich rolls. Arnott’s sales increased due to the
    favorable impact of currency, growth in biscuits, and the
    benefit of the

rd

week, partially offset by the divestitures of certain salty
    snack food brands and the business in Papua New Guinea.

In 2007, Baking and Snacking sales increased 6%. Pepperidge Farm
    sales increased primarily as a result of gains in the bakery and
    cookies and crackers businesses. The bakery business sales
    growth was driven by gains in

Pepperidge Farm

whole-grain
    breads and sandwich rolls. The cookies and crackers sales growth
    was primarily due to

Pepperidge Farm Goldfish

snack
    crackers, partially offset by a decline in cookies.
    Arnott’s sales increased, primarily due to the favorable
    impact of currency and strong branded biscuits sales
    performance, partially offset by volume declines in the
    Australian snack foods business.

International Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased 15% in
    2008 from 2007. In Europe, sales increased due to the favorable
    impact of currency, the benefit of the

rd

week, and volume gains in Belgium, partially offset by a decline
    in Germany. In the Asia Pacific region, sales increased due to
    the favorable impact of currency, growth in the Australian soup
    business and the benefit of the

rd

week. In Canada, sales increased primarily due to the favorable
    impact of currency, the benefit of the

rd

week, and growth in soup and beverages.

International Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased 12% in
    2007 versus 2006. In Europe, sales increased primarily due to
    the favorable impact of currency and strong wet soup growth in
    France, Germany and Belgium. In Canada, sales increased due to
    growth in soup and the favorable impact of currency.

In 2008, sales in North America Foodservice increased 3%
    primarily due to the benefit of the

rd

week and the impact of currency. Excluding the impact of
    currency and the benefit of the

rd

week, sales declined due primarily to weakness in the food
    service sector.

In North America Foodservice, sales increased 2% in 2007 versus
    2006 primarily due to strong growth of frozen soups and
    beverages.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold,
    increased by $170 million in 2008 from 2007 and by
    $207 million in 2007 from 2006. As a percent of sales,
    gross profit was 39.6% in 2008, 40.6% in 2007 and 40.5% in 2006.
    The percentage point decrease in 2008 was due to the impact of
    cost inflation and other factors (approximately
    3.8 percentage points), a higher level of promotional
    spending (approximately 0.5 percentage points), partially
    offset by higher selling prices (approximately
    1.5 percentage points), productivity improvements
    (approximately 1.7 percentage points) and mix
    (approximately 0.1 percentage points). The percentage point
    increase in 2007 was due to productivity improvements
    (approximately 2.0 percentage points) and higher selling
    prices (approximately 1.3 percentage points), partially
    offset by mix (approximately 0.1 percentage point), a
    higher level of promotional spending (approximately
    0.1 percentage points), costs associated with the
    relocation and

start-up

of
    a replacement refrigerated soup facility (approximately
    0.1 percentage points), a benefit from a change in the
    method of accounting for inventory in 2006 (approximately
    0.2 percentage points), and the impact of cost inflation
    and other factors (approximately 2.7 percentage points).

Marketing
    and Selling Expenses

Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 14.5%
    in 2008 and 15.0% in both 2007 and 2006. Marketing and selling
    expenses increased 5% in 2008 from 2007. The increase was
    primarily due to the impact of currency (approximately
    3 percentage points) and higher advertising (approximately
    1 percentage point). Marketing and selling expenses
    increased 7% in 2007 from 2006. The increase was primarily due
    to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense
    (approximately 5 percentage points), higher selling
    expenses (approximately 1 percentage point) and the impact
    of currency (approximately 1 percentage point).



Administrative
    Expenses

Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.6% in 2008,
    7.7% in 2007 and 8.0% in 2006. Administrative expenses increased
    6% in 2008 from 2007. Administrative expenses in 2007 included
    the reversal of $20 million of legal reserves from
    favorable results in litigation, which accounted for
    approximately 4 percentage points of the increase from 2007
    to 2008. The remaining increase in 2008 was primarily due to the
    impact of currency (approximately 3 percentage points).
    Administrative expenses increased 3% in 2007 from 2006. The
    increase was due to higher incentive compensation costs
    (approximately 3 percentage points), costs associated with
    the ongoing implementation of the SAP enterprise-resource
    planning system in North America (approximately
    1 percentage point), costs to establish businesses in
    Russia and China (approximately 1 percentage point), the
    impact of currency (approximately 1 percentage point) and
    higher general administrative expenses (approximately
    1 percentage point), partially offset by the reversal of
    $20 million of legal reserves resulting from favorable
    results in litigation (approximately 4 percentage points).

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased $4 million or
    4% in 2008 from 2007. The increase was primarily due to the
    impact of currency (approximately 3 percentage points).
    Research and development expenses increased $8 million or
    8% in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to expenses related to new
    product development (approximately 5 percentage points),
    higher incentive compensation costs (approximately
    1 percentage point) and the impact of currency
    (approximately 1 percentage point).

Other
    Expenses/(Income)

Other expense in 2008 included $6 million of impairment
    charges associated with certain trademarks used in the
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment and the pending
    sale of the sauce and mayonnaise business comprised of products
    sold under the

Lesieur

brand in France. See also
    Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other income of $30 million in 2007 included a
    $23 million gain on the sale of an idle manufacturing
    facility, a $10 million gain on a settlement in lieu of
    condemnation of a refrigerated soup facility, and a
    $3 million gain on the sale of the company’s business
    in Papua New Guinea.

Other expense of $9 million in 2006 included the cost of
    acquiring the rights to the

Goldfish

trademark in certain

non-U.S. countries

and an impairment charge on a trademark used in the Australian
    snack foods market.

Operating
    Earnings

Segment operating earnings decreased 9% in 2008 from 2007. The
    2008 results included $182 million of restructuring charges
    and related costs.

Segment operating earnings increased 12% in 2007 from 2006.

Operating earnings by segment include the effect of a 2008
    restructuring charge and related costs of $182 million as
    follows: Baking and Snacking — $144 million;
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages —
    $9 million; and North America Foodservice —
    $29 million. See Note 7 for additional information.

Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages increased 3%
    in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher sales volume,
    productivity savings, and higher price realization, partially
    offset by cost inflation.

Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages increased 6%
    in 2007 from 2006. The 2006 results included an $8 million
    benefit from the change in the method of accounting for
    inventories. The remaining increase in earnings was primarily
    due to the increase in sales and productivity improvements,
    partially offset by cost inflation and higher advertising
    expense.

Earnings from Baking and Snacking decreased 50% in 2008 from
    2007. Earnings in 2008 included $144 million in
    restructuring charges. Earnings in 2007 included a
    $23 million gain from the sale of an idle Pepperidge Farm
    manufacturing facility. Excluding these items, the remaining
    increase in earnings was due to earnings growth in the
    Australian biscuit business, the favorable impact of currency
    and gains in Pepperidge Farm.

Earnings from Baking and Snacking increased 29% in 2007 from
    2006. The 2007 results included a $23 million gain from the
    sale of an idle Pepperidge Farm manufacturing facility. The 2006
    results included a $5 million benefit from the change in
    the method of accounting for inventories. The remaining increase
    was primarily due to higher earnings at Pepperidge Farm and the
    favorable impact of currency. Within Arnott’s, excluding
    the impact of currency, an earnings increase in the biscuit
    business was offset by a decline in the Australian snack foods
    business.

Earnings from International Soup, Sauces, and Beverages
    increased 7% in 2008 from 2007. The 2008 earnings included
    $9 million of restructuring charges. Excluding this item,
    the remaining increase was due to the favorable impact of
    currency and growth in Canada and Australia soup, partially
    offset by costs to launch products in Russia and China and
    impairment charges on certain trademarks.

Earnings from International Soup, Sauces and Beverages increased
    17% in 2007 from 2006. The increase in earnings was primarily
    due to earnings growth in the businesses in Europe and Canada
    and the favorable impact of currency, partially offset by costs
    to establish businesses in Russia and China.

Earnings from North America Foodservice decreased 49%, or
    $38 million, in 2008 from 2007. Earnings in 2008 included
    $29 million of restructuring charges and related costs.
    Earnings in 2007 included a $10 million gain related to a
    settlement in lieu of condemnation of a refrigerated soup
    facility, which was partially offset by relocation and

start-up

costs associated with the replacement facility. Earnings in 2008
    were also adversely impacted by cost inflation, partially offset
    by higher selling prices and productivity gains.

Earnings from North America Foodservice increased 32% in 2007
    from 2006 due to higher net sales, productivity improvements,
    and a gain on settlement in lieu of condemnation of a
    refrigerated soup facility, partially offset by cost inflation
    and relocation and

start-up

costs associated with the replacement facility.

Unallocated corporate expenses increased $30 million from
    $102 million in 2007 to $132 million in 2008. The
    increase was primarily due to the reversal of $20 million
    of legal reserves in 2007 due to favorable results in
    litigation, a gain on the sale of the Papua New Guinea business
    in 2007 and an impairment charge in 2008 associated with the
    pending sale of the sauce and mayonnaise business sold under the

Lesieur

brand in France.

Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $3 million from
    $105 million in 2006 to $102 million in 2007. The
    decrease was primarily due to the reversal of $20 million
    of legal reserves resulting from favorable results in
    litigation, mostly offset by higher incentive compensation
    expenses and higher expenses associated with the ongoing
    implementation of the SAP enterprise-resource planning system in
    North America.

Interest
    Expense/Income

Interest expense increased 2% in 2008 from 2007. The prior year
    included a $4 million reduction in interest related to the
    APA settlement. The remaining increase was due to a reduction in
    interest in 2007 related to the favorable settlement of
    U.S. federal income tax audits and lower capitalized
    interest, partially offset by lower debt



levels. Interest income declined to $8 million in 2008 from
    $19 million in 2007 primarily due to lower levels of cash
    and cash equivalents.

Interest expense decreased 1% in 2007 from 2006. In 2007, the
    company recognized a $4 million reduction in interest
    associated with the APA settlement. In 2006, interest expense
    included a non-cash reduction of $21 million related to a
    favorable tax settlement of a U.S. tax contingency. The
    remaining net reduction in 2007 was primarily due to lower debt
    levels and lower interest expense associated with tax matters,
    partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest income
    increased to $19 million in 2007 from $15 million in
    2006 due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents.

Taxes
    on Earnings

The effective tax rate was 28.5% in 2008, 27.9% in 2007 and
    24.0% in 2006. The following factors impacted the comparability
    of the tax rate in 2008 versus 2007:

•

In 2008, the company recognized a tax benefit of
    $75 million on the $182 million pre-tax restructuring
    charge and related costs.

•

In 2008, the company recognized a $13 million benefit from
    the resolution of a state tax contingency.

•

In 2007, the company recognized a $22 million benefit from
    the favorable settlement of the APA among the company, the
    United States and Canada related to royalties.

In 2007, the company also recognized an additional net benefit
    of $40 million, following the finalization of the

2002-2004

U.S. federal tax audits.

The increase in the rate from 2006 to 2007 was primarily
    attributable to lower tax settlement amounts and higher taxes on
    foreign earnings in 2007. The 2007 effective rate included a
    benefit of $22 million resulting from the favorable
    settlement of the APA and an additional net benefit of
    $40 million following the finalization of the

2002-2004

U.S. federal tax audits. The 2006 effective rate included a
    benefit of $47 million resulting from the favorable
    resolution of a U.S. tax contingency and a benefit of
    $21 million related to the favorable resolution of the

1996-2001

U.S. federal tax audits. After factoring in these items,
    the increase in the 2007 effective rate from 2006 was primarily
    due to higher taxes on foreign earnings.

Restructuring
    Charges

On April 28, 2008, the company announced a series of
    initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term
    profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands
    and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities
    in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the company’s
    management structure. As a result of these initiatives, the
    company expects to incur aggregate pre-tax costs of
    approximately $230 million, consisting of the following:
    approximately $120 million associated with a loss on the
    sale of certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets;
    approximately $62 million in employee severance and benefit
    costs, including the estimated impact of curtailment and other
    pension charges; approximately $38 million in asset
    write-offs and accelerated depreciation of property, plant and
    equipment; and approximately $10 million in other exit
    costs. Of the aggregate $230 million of pre-tax costs, the
    company expects approximately $65 million will be cash
    expenditures, the majority of which will be spent in 2009. The
    cash outflows related to these programs are not expected to have
    a material adverse impact on the company’s liquidity.
    Annual pre-tax benefits are expected to be approximately
    $15-$20 million beginning in 2009. In 2008, the company
    recorded a restructuring charge of $175 million
    ($102 million after tax or $.27 per share) related to these
    initiatives. The charge consisted of a net loss of
    $120 million ($64 million after tax) on the sale of
    certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets,
    $45 million ($31 million after tax) of employee
    severance and benefit costs, including the estimated impact of
    curtailment and other pension charges, and $10 million
    ($7 million after tax) of property, plant and equipment
    impairment charges. In addition, approximately $7 million
    ($5 million after tax or $.01 per share) of costs related
    to these initiatives were recorded in Cost of products sold,
    primarily representing accelerated depreciation on property,
    plant and equipment. The aggregate after-tax impact of
    restructuring charges and related costs was $107 million,
    or $.28 per share.

In the third quarter of 2008, as part of the previously
    discussed initiatives, the company entered into an agreement to
    sell certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets. The
    transaction was completed on May 12,



2008. Proceeds of the sale were nominal. In connection with this
    transaction, the company recognized a net loss of
    $120 million ($64 million after tax). The terms of the
    agreement require the company to provide a loan facility to the
    buyer of AUD $10 million, or approximately USD
    $9 million. The facility can be drawn down in AUD
    $5 million increments, six months and nine months after the
    closing date. Any borrowings under the facility are to be repaid
    five years after the closing date. The company will also provide
    transition services for approximately one year. See also
    Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

In April 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives,
    the company announced plans to close the Listowel, Ontario,
    Canada food plant. The Listowel facility produces primarily
    frozen products, including soup, entrees, and Pepperidge Farm
    products, as well as ramen noodles. The facility employs
    approximately 500 people. The company plans to operate the
    facility through April 2009 and transition production to its
    network of North American contract manufacturers and to its
    Downingtown, Pennsylvania plant. As a result, the company
    recorded $20 million ($14 million after tax) of
    employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated
    impact of curtailment and other pension charges, and
    $7 million ($5 million after tax) in accelerated
    depreciation of property, plant and equipment in 2008. The
    company expects to incur approximately $15 million in
    additional employee severance and benefit costs, approximately
    $19 million in accelerated depreciation of property, plant
    and equipment, and approximately $6 million in other exit
    costs.

In April 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives,
    the company also announced plans to discontinue the private
    label biscuit and industrial chocolate production at its
    Miranda, Australia facility. The company plans to close the
    Miranda facility, which employs approximately 150 people,
    by the second quarter of 2009. In connection with this action,
    the company recorded $10 million ($7 million after
    tax) of property, plant and equipment impairment charges and
    $8 million ($6 million after tax) in employee
    severance and benefit costs. The company expects to incur an
    additional $2 million in accelerated depreciation of
    property, plant, and equipment, and approximately
    $4 million in other exit costs.

As part of the previously discussed initiatives, the company
    also plans to streamline its management structure and eliminate
    certain overhead costs. These actions began in the fourth
    quarter of 2008 and will be substantially completed in 2009. In
    connection with this action, the company recorded
    $17 million ($11 million after tax) in employee
    severance and benefit costs. The company expects to incur
    approximately $2 million of additional employee severance
    and benefit costs.

The total pre-tax costs of $230 million expected to be
    incurred by segment are as follows: Baking and
    Snacking — $151 million, International Soup,
    Sauces and Beverages — $7 million, North America
    Foodservice — $69 million, and $3 million to
    be allocated among all segments. The company incurred pre-tax
    costs of approximately $182 million in 2008 by segment as
    follows: Baking and Snacking — $144 million,
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages —
    $9 million and North America Foodservice —
    $29 million.

    additional information.

Discontinued
    Operations

On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its
    Godiva Chocolatier business for $850 million, pursuant to a
    Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The
    purchase price was subject to working capital and other
    post-closing adjustments, which resulted in an additional
    $20 million of proceeds. The company has reflected the
    results of this business as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented.
    This business was historically included in Other for segment
    reporting purposes. The company recognized a pre-tax gain of
    $698 million ($462 million after tax or $1.21 per
    share) on the sale. The company used $600 million of the
    net proceeds from the sale to purchase company stock.



The results of the company’s businesses in the United
    Kingdom and Ireland sold in August 2006 are included in
    discontinued operations. Results of the businesses are
    summarized below:

The 2007 results included a $24 million after-tax gain, or
    $.06 per share, on the sale of the businesses in the United
    Kingdom and Ireland. The 2007 results also included a
    $7 million tax benefit from the favorable resolution of tax
    audits in the United Kingdom.

The 2006 results included $56 million of deferred tax
    expense, which was recognized in accordance with Emerging Issues
    Task Force Issue

No. 93-17

“Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for a Parent
    Company’s Excess Tax Basis in the Stock of a Subsidiary
    That is Accounted for as a Discontinued Operation.” Results
    also included $7 million pre tax ($5 million after
    tax) of costs associated with the sale of the businesses.

The company used $620 million of the net proceeds from the
    sale of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to purchase
    company stock. The remaining net proceeds were used to settle
    foreign currency hedging contracts associated with intercompany
    financing transactions of the business, to pay taxes and
    expenses associated with the sale, and to repay debt.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The company expects that foreseeable liquidity and capital
    resource requirements, including cash outflows to repurchase
    shares and pay dividends, will be met through cash and cash
    equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operations, long-term
    borrowings under shelf registration statements and short-term
    borrowings, including commercial paper. Over the last three
    years, operating cash flows totaled approximately
    $2.7 billion. This cash generating capability provides the
    company with substantial financial flexibility in meeting its
    operating and investing needs. The company expects that its
    sources of financing are adequate to meet its future liquidity
    and capital resource requirements. The cost and terms of any
    future financing arrangements depend on the market conditions
    and the company’s financial position at that time.

Net cash flows from operating activities provided
    $766 million in 2008, compared to $674 million in
    2007. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in payments
    to settle foreign currency hedging transactions and lower
    investments in working capital, partially offset by tax payments
    associated with the divestiture of Godiva.

Net cash flows from operating activities provided
    $674 million in 2007, compared to $1,226 million in
    2006. The reduction was due primarily to an increase in working
    capital in 2007 as compared to a decline in 2006 and payments of
    $186 million to settle hedging transactions, primarily
    related to foreign currency.

Capital expenditures were $298 million in 2008,
    $334 million in 2007 and $309 million in 2006. Capital
    expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million
    in 2009. The increase in 2009 is primarily due to the previously
    announced expansion and enhancements of the company’s
    corporate headquarters (approximately $40 million in total)
    and expansion of the U.S. beverage production capacity
    (approximately $60 million in total). Capital expenditures
    in 2008 included investments to expand the Pepperidge Farm
    bakery production capacity, implement the SAP
    enterprise-resource planning system in North America, expand the
    U.S. beverage production capacity, and expand the warehouse
    at the Maxton, North Carolina facility. Capital expenditures in
    2007 and 2006



included investments to increase the manufacturing capacity for
    refrigerated soups in a new facility, implement the SAP
    enterprise-resource planning system in North America, and
    implement certain productivity and quality projects in
    manufacturing facilities.

Business acquired, as presented in the Statement of Cash Flows,
    represents the acquisition of the Wolfgang Puck soup business in
    the fourth quarter of 2008.

Net cash provided by investing activities includes
    $828 million of proceeds from the sale of the Godiva
    Chocolatier business and certain Australian salty snack food
    brands and assets, net of cash divested. Net cash provided by
    investing activities in 2007 includes $906 million of
    proceeds from the sale of the businesses in the United Kingdom,
    Ireland and Papua New Guinea, net of cash divested.

There were no new long-term borrowings in 2008 and 2007.
    Long-term borrowings in 2006 included the issuance of
    $202 million of five-year variable-rate debt in Australia
    due July 2011. The proceeds were used to repatriate earnings
    pursuant to the AJCA. While planning for the issuance of the
    debt, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to
    effectively fix the interest rate on $149 million of the
    debt prior to its issuance.

Dividend payments were $329 million in 2008,
    $308 million in 2007 and $292 million in 2006. Annual
    dividends declared in 2008 were $.88 per share, $.80 per share
    in 2007 and $.72 per share in 2006. The 2008 fourth quarter rate
    was $.22 per share.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares,
    the company repurchased 26 million shares at a cost of
    $903 million during 2008. During fiscal 2008, the company
    purchased shares pursuant to two publicly announced share
    repurchase programs. Under the first program, which was
    announced on November 21, 2005, the company’s Board of
    Directors authorized the purchase of up to $600 million of
    company stock through the end of fiscal 2008. The November 2005
    program was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
    Under the second program, which was announced on March 18,
    2008, the company’s Board of Directors authorized using
    approximately $600 million of the net proceeds from the
    sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business to purchase company
    stock. The March 2008 program was completed during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008. Under a new program, which was announced
    on June 30, 2008 and will begin in fiscal 2009, the
    company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up
    to $1.2 billion of company stock through the end of fiscal
    2011. In addition to the publicly announced share repurchase
    programs, the company also purchased shares to offset the impact
    of dilution from shares issued under the company’s stock
    compensation plans. The company expects to continue this
    practice in the future. Of the 2008 repurchases, approximately
    23 million shares at a cost of $800 million were made
    pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. The
    remaining shares were repurchased to offset the impact of
    dilution from shares issued under the company’s stock
    compensation plans.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements on vesting of restricted shares, the
    company repurchased 30 million shares at a cost of
    $1,140 million during 2007. Of the 2007 repurchases,
    approximately 21 million shares at a cost of
    $820 million were made pursuant to the company’s then
    two publicly announced share repurchase programs. The remaining
    shares were repurchased to offset the impact of dilution from
    shares issued under the company’s stock compensation plans.
    The first share repurchase program was the previously discussed
    Board of Directors authorization announced on November 21,
    2005. Under the second share repurchase program, which was
    announced on August 15, 2006, the company’s Board of
    Directors authorized using up to $620 million of the net
    proceeds from the sale of United Kingdom and Ireland businesses
    to purchase company stock. The August 2006 program terminated at
    the end of fiscal 2007. See “Market for Registrant’s
    Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and Issuer Purchases
    of Equity Securities” for more information.

At August 3, 2008, the company had $982 million of
    notes payable due within one year and $33 million of
    standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. The
    company has a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit
    facility maturing in 2011, which was unused at August 3,
    2008, except for $33 million of standby letters of credit.
    This agreement supports the company’s commercial paper
    programs.

As of August 3, 2008, the company had $300 million
    available for issuance under a $1 billion shelf
    registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission in June 2002. Under the registration statement, the
    company may issue debt securities, depending on market
    conditions. The June 2002 registration statement will expire in
    December 2008.



The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its
    revolving credit facilities and debt securities.

    Obligations and Other Commitments

Contractual
    Obligations

The following table summarizes the company’s obligations
    and commitments to make future payments under certain
    contractual obligations. For additional information on debt, see
    Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating
    leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office
    facilities and certain equipment. Purchase commitments represent
    purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements related to
    the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment
    and services. These commitments are not expected to have a
    material impact on liquidity. Other long-term liabilities
    primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation
    obligations. For additional information on other long-term
    liabilities, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments

The company guarantees approximately 1,800 bank loans to
    Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party
    financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The
    maximum potential amount of the future payments the company
    could be required to make under the guarantees is
    $151 million. The company’s



guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes.
    The company does not believe that it is probable that it will be
    required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on
    the bank loans guaranteed. In connection with the sale of
    certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets, the
    company agreed to provide a loan facility to the buyer of AUD
    $10 million, or approximately USD $9 million. The
    facility can be drawn down in AUD $5 million increments,
    six and nine months after the closing date, which was
    May 12, 2008. Any borrowings under the facility are to be
    repaid five years after the closing date. See also Note 14
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on
    off-balance sheet arrangements.

Inflation

In fiscal 2008, inflation, on average, has been significantly
    higher than previous years. The company uses a number of
    strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation. These
    strategies include increasing prices, pursuing cost productivity
    initiatives such as global procurement strategies, commodity
    hedging and making capital investments that improve the
    efficiency of operations.

Market
    Risk Sensitivity

The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are
    changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency
    exchange rates. In addition, the company is exposed to equity
    price changes related to certain deferred compensation
    obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in
    interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and
    fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to
    maintain its variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted
    guidelines. International operations, which accounted for
    approximately 32% of 2008 net sales, are concentrated
    principally in Australia, Canada, France and Germany. The
    company manages its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in
    various foreign currencies and utilizing cross-currency swaps
    and forward contracts. Swaps and forward contracts are entered
    into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures
    and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures.
    The company does not enter into contracts for speculative
    purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders
    and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in
    connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain
    commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters
    into commodity futures contracts, as considered appropriate, to
    reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities such
    as soybean oil, wheat, soybean meal, corn, cocoa and
    natural gas.

The information below summarizes the company’s market risks
    associated with debt obligations and other significant financial
    instruments as of August 3, 2008. Fair values included
    herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or
    pricing models using current market rates. The information
    presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 11
    and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



The table below presents principal cash flows and related

As of July 29, 2007, fixed-rate debt of approximately
    $1.9 billion with an average interest rate of 6.17% and
    variable-rate debt of approximately $756 million with an
    average interest rate of 6.40% were outstanding. As of
    July 29, 2007, the company had swapped $675 million of
    fixed-rate debt to variable. The average rate to be received on
    these swaps was 5.17% and the average rate paid was estimated to
    be 5.88% over the remaining life of the swaps. As of
    July 29, 2007, the company had also swapped
    $85 million of variable-rate debt to fixed. The average
    rate estimated to be received on these swaps was 7.15% and the
    average rate to be paid was 6.73%.

The company is exposed to foreign exchange risk related to its
    international operations, including non-functional currency
    intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries.

The cross-currency swap contracts outstanding at July 29,
    2007 represented one pay fixed SEK/receive fixed USD swap with a
    notional value of $32 million, one pay variable SEK/receive
    variable USD swap with a notional value of $9 million, two
    pay fixed CAD/receive fixed USD swaps with notional values
    totaling $120 million, one pay variable CAD/receive
    variable USD swap with a notional value of $38 million, two
    pay fixed EUR/receive fixed USD swaps with notional values
    totaling $171 million and two pay variable EUR/receive
    variable USD swaps with notional values totaling
    $171 million. The aggregate notional value of these swap
    contracts was $541 million as of July 29, 2007, and
    the aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was a loss of
    $62 million as of July 29, 2007.

The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result
    of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency
    of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. The company
    utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to
    hedge these exposures. The table below summarizes the foreign
    exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related

The company had an additional $10 million in a number of
    smaller contracts to purchase or sell various other currencies,
    such as the Australian dollar, euro, British pound, Japanese
    yen, and Swedish krona, as of August 3, 2008. The aggregate
    fair value of all contracts was a gain of $1 million as of
    August 3, 2008. The total forward exchange contracts
    outstanding as of July 29, 2007 were $228 million with
    a fair value of a loss of $4 million.

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders
    and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in
    connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain
    commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters
    into commodity futures and options contracts, as considered
    appropriate, to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for
    commodities. The notional value of these contracts was
    $146 million and the aggregate fair value of these
    contracts was a loss of $3 million as of August 3,
    2008.

The company had swap contracts outstanding as of August 3,
    2008, which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain
    deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of
    the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the total return
    of the company’s capital stock and the total return of the
    Puritan Fund. Under these contracts, the company pays variable
    interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Index total return, the
    Puritan Fund total return, or the total return on company
    capital stock. The notional value of the contract that is linked
    to the return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
    was $16 million at August 3, 2008 and $22 million
    at July 29, 2007. The average interest rate applicable to
    the contract, which expires in 2009, was 3.19% at August 3,
    2008. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the
    return on the Puritan Fund was $9 million at August 3,
    2008 and $13 million at July 29, 2007. The average
    interest rate applicable to the contract, which expires in 2009,
    was 3.59% at August 3, 2008. The notional value of the
    contract that is linked to the total return on company capital
    stock was $31 million at August 3, 2008 and
    $29 million at July 29, 2007. The average interest
    rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2009, was
    3.39% at August 3, 2008. The fair value of these contracts
    was a $1 million gain at August 3, 2008 and a
    $2 million loss at July 29, 2007.

The company’s utilization of financial instruments in
    managing market risk exposures described above is consistent
    with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial
    instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt
    repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign
    currency, and the company’s acquisition and divestiture
    activities.

Significant
    Accounting Estimates

The consolidated financial statements of the company are
    prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States. The preparation of these
    financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported
    amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates and
    assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies.
    The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex
    judgments, estimates and assumptions:

Trade and consumer promotion programs

— The
    company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and
    consumers, such as cooperative advertising programs, feature
    price discounts, in-store display incentives and coupons. The
    recognition of the costs for these programs, which are
    classified as a reduction of revenue, involves use of judgment
    related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are
    made based on



historical experience and other factors. Actual expenses may
    differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary
    from estimates.

Valuation of long-lived assets

— Long-lived
    assets, including fixed assets and intangibles, are reviewed for
    impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur
    indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
    recoverable. Discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess
    nonamortizable intangible asset impairment, while undiscounted
    cash flow analyses are used to assess other long-lived asset
    impairment. The estimates of future cash flows involve
    considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions
    about expected future operating performance. Assumptions used in
    these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. The
    actual cash flows could differ from management’s estimates
    due to changes in business conditions, operating performance,
    and economic conditions.

Pension and postretirement benefits

— The
    company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to
    employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with
    such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions,
    including discount rates, expected return on plan assets,
    compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend
    rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the
    required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that
    differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated
    and amortized over future periods.

The discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal
    year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate,
    the company reviews published market indices of high-quality
    debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In
    addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield
    curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The
    expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based
    upon historical experience and expected future performance,
    considering the company’s current and projected investment
    mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation,
    long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a
    premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period,
    significant differences may arise between the actual return and
    the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets,
    used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a
    calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between
    the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated
    method. Gains and losses resulting from differences between
    actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each
    measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the
    greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized
    into earnings in the following year.

Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was
    $54 million in 2008, $57 million in 2007 and
    $77 million in 2006. The 2008 expense included
    $2 million of special termination benefits and curtailment
    costs related to the Godiva divestiture, which was recorded in
    discontinued operations. The 2008 expense also included
    $4 million of special termination and curtailment costs
    related to the restructuring initiatives. Significant
    weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year are as
    follows:




Pension

Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are
    as follows: a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate
    would increase expense by approximately $11 million; a
    50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets
    assumption would increase expense by approximately
    $10 million. A one percentage point increase in assumed
    health care costs would increase postretirement service and
    interest cost by approximately $1 million.

Although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the
    U.S. plans in 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company made
    voluntary contributions of $70 million in 2008,
    $22 million in 2007 and $35 million in 2006 to a
    U.S. plan based on expected future funding requirements.
    Contributions to international plans were $8 million in



2008, $10 million in 2007 and $17 million in 2006. The
    company does not expect to make any contributions to the
    U.S. plans in 2009. Contributions to

non-U.S. plans

are expected to be approximately $9 million in 2009.

As of July 29, 2007, the company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).” SFAS No. 158
    requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined
    benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability on the
    balance sheet and requires any unrecognized prior service cost
    and actuarial gains/losses to be recognized in other
    comprehensive income.

See also Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information on pension and postretirement
    expenses.

Income taxes

— The effective tax rate reflects
    statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the
    various jurisdictions in which the company operates and
    management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various
    tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in
    determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax
    positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable
    or payable in the current year and include the effect of
    deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the future impact of differences between the
    financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
    and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss
    and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences
    are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances
    are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely
    than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

In 2008, the tax reserves are established in accordance with
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No.
    (FIN) 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109,” which was adopted at the beginning of fiscal
    2008. Upon adoption, the company recognized a cumulative-effect
    adjustment of $6 million as an increase in the liability
    for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties,
    and a reduction in retained earnings. Prior to the adoption of
    FIN 48, tax reserves were established to reflect the
    probable outcome of known tax contingencies. As of
    August 3, 2008, the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits, including interest and penalties, was $61 million.

See also Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion on income taxes.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157
    “Fair Value Measurements,” which provides guidance for
    using fair value to measure assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 157 establishes a definition of fair value,
    provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands the
    disclosure requirements about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 as issued is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is
    permitted. On February 12, 2008, FASB Staff Position

No. FAS 157-2

was issued which delays the effective date to fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2008 for certain nonfinancial
    assets and liabilities. The company is currently evaluating the
    impact of SFAS No. 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” SFAS No. 159 allows companies to
    choose, at specific election dates, to measure eligible
    financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not
    otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company
    elects the fair value option for an eligible item, changes in
    that item’s fair value in subsequent reporting periods must
    be recognized in current earnings. SFAS No. 159 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. The company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS No. 159.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007) “Business Combinations,” which
    establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer
    recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date.
    This Statement applies to business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is after the beginning of the first annual
    reporting period beginning after December 15, 2008. Earlier
    adoption is not permitted. The company is currently evaluating
    the impact of SFAS No. 141 as revised.



In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an Amendment of ARB No. 51.”
    SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting
    standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and
    for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be recorded as equity in
    the consolidated financial statements. This Statement also
    requires that consolidated net income shall be adjusted to
    include the net income attributed to the noncontrolling
    interest. Disclosure on the face of the income statement of the
    amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent
    and to the noncontrolling interest is required.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted.
    The company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS No. 160.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133,” which enhances the disclosure requirements
    for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are
    required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) the
    location and amounts of derivative instruments in an
    entity’s financial statements, (b) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under
    Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
    entity’s financial position, financial performance, and
    cash flows. The guidance in SFAS No. 161 is effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim
    periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early
    application encouraged. This Statement encourages, but does not
    require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial
    adoption. The company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS No. 161.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162 “The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.”
    SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting
    principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be
    used in the preparation of financial statements of
    nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United
    States (the GAAP hierarchy). This Statement is effective
    60 days following the SEC’s approval of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU
    Section 411,

The Meaning of

Present Fairly in
    Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The
    company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS No. 162.

Cautionary
    Factors That May Affect Future Results

This Report contains “forward-looking” statements that
    reflect the company’s current expectations regarding future
    results of operations, economic performance, financial condition
    and achievements of the company. The company tries, wherever
    possible, to identify these forward-looking statements by using
    words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “estimate,” “expect,” “will” and
    similar expressions. One can also identify them by the fact that
    they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
    These statements reflect the company’s current plans and
    expectations and are based on information currently available to
    it. They rely on a number of assumptions regarding future events
    and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are inherently
    subject to risks and uncertainties.

The company wishes to caution the reader that the following
    important factors and those important factors described in
    Part 1, Item 1A and elsewhere in the commentary, or in
    the Securities and Exchange Commission filings of the company,
    could affect the company’s actual results and could cause
    such results to vary materially from those expressed in any
    forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company:

•

the impact of strong competitive response to the company’s
    efforts to leverage its brand power with product innovation,
    promotional programs and new advertising, and of changes in
    consumer demand for the company’s products;

•

the risks in the marketplace associated with trade and consumer
    acceptance of product improvements, shelving initiatives and new
    product introductions;

•

the company’s ability to achieve sales and earnings
    guidance, which are based on assumptions about sales volume,
    product mix, the development and success of new products, the
    impact of marketing and pricing actions and product costs;



•

the company’s ability to realize projected cost savings and
    benefits, including those contemplated by restructuring programs
    and other cost-savings initiatives;

•

the company’s ability to successfully manage changes to its
    business processes, including selling, distribution, product
    capacity, information management systems and the integration of
    acquisitions;

•

the increased significance of certain of the company’s key
    trade customers;

•

the impact of fluctuations in the supply and inflation in
    energy, raw and packaging materials cost;

•

the risks associated with portfolio changes and completion of
    acquisitions and divestitures;

•

the uncertainties of litigation described from time to time in
    the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings;

•

the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, tax rates,
    interest rates, debt and equity markets, inflation rates,
    economic conditions and other external factors; and

•

the impact of unforeseen business disruptions in one or more of
    the company’s markets due to political instability, civil
    disobedience, armed hostilities, natural disasters or other
    calamities.

This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but
    is designed to highlight important factors that may impact the
    company’s outlook. The company disclaims any obligation or
    intent to update forward-looking statements made by the company
    in order to reflect new information, events or circumstances
    after the date they are made.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

— The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of the company and its
    majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are
    eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior year
    financial statements were reclassified to conform to the
    current-year presentation. The company’s fiscal year ends
    on the Sunday nearest July 31. There were 53 weeks in
    2008 and 52 weeks in 2007 and 2006. There will be
    52 weeks in 2009.

On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its
    Godiva Chocolatier business for $850, pursuant to a Sale and
    Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The company has
    reflected the results of this business as discontinued
    operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all
    years presented. See Note 3 for additional information on
    the sale.

On August 15, 2006, the company completed the sale of its
    United Kingdom and Ireland businesses for £460, or
    approximately $870, pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement
    dated July 12, 2006. The company has reflected the results
    of these businesses as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. See
    Note 3 for additional information on the sale.

Revenue Recognition

— Revenues are recognized
    when the earnings process is complete. This occurs when products
    are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements, title and
    risk of loss transfer to customers, collection is probable and
    pricing is fixed or determinable. Revenues are recognized net of
    provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Certain sales
    promotion expenses, such as coupon redemption costs, cooperative
    advertising programs, new product introduction fees, feature
    price discounts and in-store display incentives are classified
    as a reduction of sales.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— All highly liquid
    debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or
    less are classified as cash equivalents.

Inventories

— All inventories are valued at the
    lower of average cost or market. Prior to 2006, substantially
    all U.S. inventories were valued based on the last in,
    first out (LIFO) method. As of August 1, 2005, the company
    changed the method of accounting for certain
    U.S. inventories from the LIFO method to the average cost
    method. The company believes the average cost method of
    accounting for inventories is preferable and improves financial
    reporting by better matching revenues and expenses as average
    cost reflects the physical flow of inventory and current cost.
    The impact of the change was a pre-tax $13 benefit ($8 after tax
    or $.02 per share). Prior periods were not restated since the
    impact of the change on previously issued financial statements
    was not considered material.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant
    and equipment are recorded at historical cost and are
    depreciated over estimated useful lives using the straight-line
    method. Buildings and machinery and equipment are depreciated
    over periods not exceeding 45 years and 15 years,
    respectively. Assets are evaluated for impairment when
    conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Such conditions include significant adverse changes
    in business climate or a plan of disposal.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

— Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather
    are tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Intangible
    assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful
    life and reviewed for impairment in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-lived Assets.” Goodwill impairment testing
    first requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting
    unit to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds fair
    value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of impairment
    is the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and the
    “implied” fair value, which is calculated as if the
    reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a
    business combination. Impairment testing for indefinite-lived
    intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value
    and carrying value of the asset. If carrying value exceeds the
    fair value, the asset is reduced to fair value. Fair values are
    primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses. See
    Note 5 for information on goodwill and other intangible
    assets.

Derivative Financial Instruments

— The company
    uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of
    hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign
    currency exchange rates, commodities and equity-linked employee
    benefit obligations. All derivatives are recognized on the
    balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives are recorded in earnings or other comprehensive
    income, based on whether the instrument is designated as part of
    a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction.
    Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other
    comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period
    in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item.
    The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in earnings
    in the current period. See Note 12 for additional
    information.

Stock-Based Compensation

— In December 2004,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) “Share-Based
    Payment” (SFAS No. 123R), which requires
    stock-based compensation to be measured based on the grant-date
    fair value of the awards and the cost to be recognized over the
    period during which an employee is required to provide service
    in exchange for the award. The company adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R as of August 1, 2005. The company
    provides compensation benefits by issuing unrestricted stock,
    restricted stock (including EPS performance restricted stock and
    total shareowner return (TSR) performance restricted stock) and
    restricted stock units. In previous fiscal years, the company
    also issued stock options and stock appreciation rights to
    provide compensation benefits.

Prior to August 1, 2005, the company accounted for
    stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees” and related Interpretations.
    Accordingly, no compensation expense had been recognized for
    stock options since all options granted had an exercise price
    equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the grant
    date. SFAS No. 123R was adopted using the modified
    prospective transition method. Under this method, the provisions
    of SFAS No. 123R apply to all awards granted or
    modified after the date of adoption. In addition, compensation
    expense must be recognized for any unvested stock option awards
    outstanding as of the date of adoption.

Total pre-tax stock-based compensation recognized in Earnings
    from continuing operations was $83 for 2008 and $79 for 2007 and
    2006. Tax related benefits of $31 were recognized for 2008 and
    $29 were recognized for 2007 and 2006. Stock-based compensation
    associated with discontinued operations was $3, $2 and $4
    after-tax in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. See also
    Note 13.

Use of Estimates

— Generally accepted
    accounting principles require management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect assets and liabilities, contingent
    assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Income Taxes

— Income taxes are accounted for
    in accordance with SFAS No. 109 “Accounting for Income
    Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
    for the future impact of differences between the financial
    statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
    respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
    income in the years in which those temporary differences are
    expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
    assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
    income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation
    allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is
    more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    (FIN 48) “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No.
    109.” FIN 48 clarifies the criteria that must be met
    for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax
    positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This
    Interpretation also addresses derecognition, recognition of
    related penalties and interest, classification of liabilities
    and disclosures of unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2006. The company adopted FIN 48 as of July 30, 2007
    (the beginning of fiscal 2008). See Note 10 for additional
    information.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (the AJCA) was
    signed into law. The AJCA provides for a deduction of 85% of
    certain

non-U.S. earnings

that are repatriated, as defined by the AJCA, and a phased-in
    tax deduction related to profits from domestic manufacturing
    activities. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB

and

to
    address the accounting and disclosure requirements related to
    the AJCA. The total amount repatriated in 2006 under the AJCA
    was $494 and the related tax cost was $20. In 2005, the company
    recorded $7 in tax expense for $200 of anticipated earnings to
    be repatriated. In 2006, the company finalized its plan under
    the AJCA and recorded tax expense of $13 for $294 of earnings
    repatriated.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157
    “Fair Value Measurements,” which provides guidance for
    using fair value to measure assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 157 establishes a definition of fair value,
    provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands the
    disclosure requirements about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 as issued is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is
    permitted. On February 12, 2008, FASB Staff Position
    No. FAS

157-2

was
    issued which delays the effective date to fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008 for certain nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities. The company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS No. 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” SFAS No. 159 allows companies to
    choose, at specific election dates, to measure eligible
    financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not
    otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company
    elects the fair value option for an eligible item, changes in
    that item’s fair value in subsequent reporting periods must
    be recognized in current earnings. SFAS No. 159 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. The company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS No. 159.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007) “Business Combinations,” which
    establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer
    recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date.
    This Statement applies to business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is after the beginning of the first annual
    reporting period beginning after December 15, 2008. Earlier
    adoption is not permitted. The company is currently evaluating
    the impact of SFAS No. 141 as revised.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an Amendment of ARB No. 51.”
    SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards
    for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be recorded as equity in
    the consolidated financial statements. This Statement also
    requires that consolidated net income shall be adjusted to
    include the net income attributed to the noncontrolling
    interest. Disclosure on the face of the income statement of the
    amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent
    and to the noncontrolling interest is required.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted.
    The company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No.
    160.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No.
    133,” which enhances the disclosure requirements for
    derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are
    required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) the
    location and amounts of derivative instruments in an
    entity’s financial statements, (b) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under
    Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
    entity’s financial position, financial performance, and
    cash flows. The guidance in SFAS No. 161 is effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim
    periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early
    application encouraged. This Statement encourages, but does not
    require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial
    adoption. The company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS No. 161.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162 “The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.”
    SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting
    principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be
    used in the preparation of financial statements of
    nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United
    States (the GAAP hierarchy). This Statement is effective
    60 days following the SEC’s approval of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU
    Section 411,

The Meaning of

Present Fairly in
    Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The
    company is currently evaluating the impact of

Divestitures

Discontinued
    Operations

On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its
    Godiva Chocolatier business for $850. The purchase price was
    subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in
    an additional $20 of proceeds. The company has reflected the
    results of this business as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. The
    business was historically included in Other for segment
    reporting purposes. The company used approximately $600 of the
    net proceeds to purchase company stock.

On August 15, 2006, the company completed the sale of its
    businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland for £460, or
    approximately $870, pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement
    dated July 12, 2006. The United Kingdom and Ireland
    businesses included

The 2007 results included a $24 after-tax gain, or $.06 per
    share, on the United Kingdom and Ireland sale. The 2007 results
    also included a $7 tax benefit from the favorable resolution of
    tax audits in the United Kingdom.

The 2006 results included deferred tax expense of $56, which was
    recognized in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue

No. 93-17

“Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for a Parent
    Company’s Excess Tax Basis in the Stock of a Subsidiary
    That is Accounted for as a Discontinued Operation” due to
    book/tax basis differences of these businesses as of
    July 30, 2006. The 2006 results also included $7 pre tax
    ($5 after tax) of costs associated with the sale, for a total
    net after-tax cost of $61 (or $.15 per share) recognized in
    connection with the sale in 2006.

The company used approximately $620 of the net proceeds from the
    sale of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to repurchase
    shares. Upon completion of the sale, the company paid $83 to
    settle cross-currency swap contracts and foreign exchange
    forward contracts which hedged exposures related to the
    businesses. The remaining net proceeds were used to pay taxes
    and expenses associated with the business and to repay debt.

Business
    and Geographic Segment Information

Campbell Soup Company, together with its consolidated
    subsidiaries, is a global manufacturer and marketer of
    high-quality, branded convenience food products. Prior to the
    second quarter of fiscal 2008, the company managed and reported
    the results of operations in the following segments:
    U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages, Baking and Snacking,
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages, and the balance of the
    portfolio in Other. Other included the Godiva Chocolatier
    worldwide business and the company’s Away From Home
    operations, which represent the distribution of products such as
    soup, specialty entrees, beverage products, other prepared foods
    and Pepperidge Farm products through various food service
    channels in the United States and Canada. As of the second
    quarter of fiscal 2008, the results of the Godiva Chocolatier
    business were reported as discontinued operations for the years
    presented due to the sale. See Note 3 for additional
    information on the sale. Beginning with the second quarter of
    fiscal 2008, the Away From Home business was reported as North
    America Foodservice.

In connection with the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business,
    the company modified the allocation methodology of certain
    corporate expenses to the remaining segments. In addition,
    following the recent distribution

agreement with The

Coca-Cola

Company and

Coca-Cola

Enterprises Inc., sales and earnings from certain beverage
    products historically included in North America Foodservice
    segment are now reported in U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages
    and International Soup, Sauces and Beverages. Segment results of
    prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the current
    presentation.

The U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment includes the
    following retail businesses:

Campbell’s

condensed
    and ready-to-serve soups;

Swanson

broth and canned
    poultry;

Prego

pasta sauce;

Pace

Mexican sauce;

Campbell’s Chunky

chili;

Campbell’s

canned pasta, gravies, and beans;

Campbell’s Supper
    Bakes

meal kits;

V8

juice and juice drinks; and

Campbell’s

tomato juice.

The Baking and Snacking segment includes the following
    businesses:

Pepperidge Farm

cookies, crackers, bakery and
    frozen products in U.S. retail;

Arnott’s

biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific; and

Arnott’s

salty snacks in Australia. In May 2008, the
    company sold certain salty snack food brands and assets in
    Australia, which historically were included in this segment. In
    June 2007, the company sold its ownership interest in Papua New
    Guinea operations, which historically were included in this
    segment.

The International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment includes
    the soup, sauce and beverage businesses outside of the United
    States, including Europe, Mexico, Latin America, the Asia
    Pacific region and the retail business in Canada. See also
    Note 3 for information on the sale of the businesses in the
    United Kingdom and Ireland. These businesses were historically
    included in this segment. The results of operations of these
    businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations for
    all years presented.

Accounting policies for measuring segment assets and earnings
    before interest and taxes are substantially consistent with
    those described in Note 1. The company evaluates segment
    performance before interest and taxes. North America Foodservice
    products are principally produced by the tangible assets of the
    company’s other segments, except for refrigerated soups,
    which are produced in a separate facility, and certain other
    products, which are produced under contract manufacturing
    agreements. Accordingly, with the exception of a refrigerated
    soup facility, plant assets are not allocated to the North
    America Foodservice operations. Depreciation, however, is
    allocated to North America Foodservice based on production hours.

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and
    its affiliates, accounted for approximately 16% of consolidated
    net sales in 2008, 15% in 2007 and 14% in 2006. All of the
    company’s segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
    or its affiliates.

Restructuring
    Charges

On April 28, 2008, the company announced a series of
    initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term
    profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands
    and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities
    in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the company’s
    management structure. As a result of these initiatives, the
    company expects to incur aggregate pre-tax costs of
    approximately $230, consisting of the following: approximately
    $120 associated with a loss on the sale of certain Australian
    salty snack food brands and assets; approximately $62 in
    employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated
    impact of curtailment and other pension charges; approximately
    $38 in asset write-offs and accelerated depreciation of
    property, plant and equipment; and approximately $10 in other
    exit costs. Of the aggregate $230 of pre-tax costs, the company
    expects approximately $65 will be cash expenditures, the
    majority of which will be spent in 2009. In 2008, the company
    recorded a restructuring charge of $175 ($102 after tax or $.27
    per share) related to these initiatives. The charge consisted of
    a net loss of $120 ($64 after tax) on the sale of certain
    Australian salty snack food brands and assets, $45 ($31 after
    tax) of employee severance and benefit costs, including the
    estimated impact of curtailment and other pension charges, and
    $10 ($7 after tax) of property, plant and equipment impairment
    charges. In addition, approximately $7 ($5 after tax or $.01 per
    share) of costs related to these initiatives were recorded in
    Cost of products sold, primarily representing accelerated
    depreciation on property, plant and equipment. The aggregate
    after-tax impact of restructuring charges and related costs was
    $107, or $.28 per share.

In the third quarter of 2008, as part of the previously
    discussed initiatives, the company entered into an agreement to
    sell certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets. The
    transaction was completed on May 12, 2008. Proceeds of the
    sale were nominal. See also Note 3.

In April 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives,
    the company announced plans to close the Listowel, Ontario,
    Canada food plant. The Listowel facility produces primarily
    frozen products, including soup, entrees, and Pepperidge Farm
    products, as well as ramen noodles. The facility employs
    approximately 500 people. The company plans to operate the
    facility through April 2009 and transition production to its
    network of North American contract manufacturers and to its
    Downingtown, Pennsylvania plant. As a result, the company
    recorded $20 ($14 after tax) of employee severance and benefit
    costs, including the estimated impact of curtailment and other
    pension charges, and $7 ($5 after tax) in accelerated
    depreciation of property, plant and equipment in 2008. The
    company expects to incur approximately $15 in additional
    employee severance and benefit costs, approximately $19 in
    accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and
    approximately $6 in other exit costs.

In April 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives,
    the company also announced plans to discontinue the private
    label biscuit and industrial chocolate production at its
    Miranda, Australia facility. The company plans to close the
    Miranda facility, which employs approximately 150 people,
    by the second quarter of 2009. In connection with this action,
    the company recorded $10 ($7 after tax) of property, plant and
    equipment impairment charges and $8 ($6 after tax) in employee
    severance and benefit costs. The company expects to incur an
    additional $2 in accelerated depreciation of property, plant,
    and equipment, and approximately $4 in other exit costs.

As part of the previously discussed initiatives, the company
    also plans to streamline its management structure and eliminate
    certain overhead costs. These actions began in the fourth
    quarter of 2008 and will be substantially completed in 2009. In
    connection with this action, the company recorded $17 ($11 after
    tax) in employee severance and benefit costs. The company
    expects to incur approximately $2 of additional employee
    severance and benefit costs.

Acquisitions

In June 2008, the company acquired the Wolfgang Puck soup
    business from Country Gourmet Foods for approximately $10, of
    which approximately $1 will be paid in the next two years. The
    company also entered into a master licensing agreement with
    Wolfgang Puck Worldwide, Inc. for the use of the

Wolfgang
    Puck

brand on soup, stock, and broth products in North
    America retail locations.

Wolfgang Puck

is one of the
    leading organic soup brands in the United States. This business
    is included in the U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment.
    The pro forma impact on sales, net earnings or earnings per
    share for the prior periods would not have been material.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

— Substantially all of the
    company’s U.S. and certain

non-U.S. employees

are covered by noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. In
    1999, the company implemented significant amendments to certain
    U.S. plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are
    determined based on percentages of annual pay and age. To
    minimize the impact of converting to the new formula, service
    and earnings credit continues to accrue for active employees
    participating in the plans under the formula prior to the
    amendments through the year 2014. Employees will receive the
    benefit from either the new or old formula, whichever is higher.
    Benefits become vested upon the completion of three years of
    service. Benefits are paid from funds previously provided to
    trustees and insurance companies or are paid directly by the
    company from general funds. Plan assets consist primarily of
    investments in equities, fixed income securities, and real
    estate.

Postretirement Benefits

— The company provides
    postretirement benefits including health care and life insurance
    to substantially all retired U.S. employees and their
    dependents. In 1999, changes were made to the postretirement
    benefits offered to certain U.S. employees. Participants
    who were not receiving postretirement benefits as of May 1,
    1999 will no longer be eligible to receive such benefits in the
    future, but the company will provide access to health care
    coverage for non-eligible future retirees on a group basis.
    Costs will be paid by the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

participants. To preserve the economic benefits for employees
    near retirement as of May 1, 1999, participants who were at
    least age 55 and had at least 10 years of continuous
    service remain eligible for postretirement benefits.

In 2005, the company established retiree medical account
    benefits for eligible U.S. retirees, intended to provide
    reimbursement for eligible health care expenses.

On July 29, 2007, the company adopted
    SFAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
    132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to
    recognize the funded status of defined postretirement benefit
    plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and requires
    any unrecognized prior service cost and actuarial gains/losses
    to be recognized in other comprehensive income.
    SFAS No. 158 does not affect the company’s
    consolidated results of operations or cash flows. As a result of
    the adoption in 2007, total assets were reduced by $294,
    shareowners’ equity was reduced by $230, and total
    liabilities were reduced by $64.

The company uses the fiscal year end as the measurement date for
    the benefit plans.

The fundamental goal underlying the pension plans’
    investment policy is to ensure that the assets of the plans are
    invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the
    plans as these obligations come due. Investment practices must
    comply with applicable laws and regulations.

The company’s investment strategy is based on an
    expectation that equity securities will outperform debt
    securities over the long term. Accordingly, in order to maximize
    the return on assets, a majority of assets are invested in
    equities. Additional asset classes with dissimilar expected
    rates of return, return volatility, and correlations of returns
    are utilized to reduce risk by providing diversification
    relative to equities. Investments within each asset class are
    also diversified to further reduce the impact of losses in
    single investments. The use of derivative instruments is
    permitted where appropriate and necessary to achieve overall
    investment policy objectives and asset class targets.

The company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage
    targets and appropriate benchmarks for each significant asset
    class to obtain a prudent balance between return and risk. The
    interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is
    periodically studied to assist in the establishment of strategic
    asset allocation targets.

The company made voluntary contributions of $70 to a

    August 3, 2008. The company is not required to make
    additional contributions to the U.S. plans in fiscal 2009.

In the third quarter of 2007, the company recorded a tax benefit

In 2006, the tax effect of international items in 2006 included
    a $14 deferred tax benefit related to foreign tax credits, which
    could be utilized as a result of the sale of the United Kingdom
    and Ireland businesses. See also Note 3 for information on
    the divestiture.

The company received an Examination Report from the Internal
    Revenue Service (IRS) on December 23, 2002, which included
    a challenge to the treatment of gains and interest deductions
    claimed in the company’s fiscal 1995 federal income tax
    return, relating to transactions involving government
    securities. If the proposed adjustment were upheld, it would
    have required the company to pay a net amount of over $100 in
    taxes, accumulated interest and penalties. The company had
    maintained a reserve for a portion of this contingency. In
    November 2005, the company negotiated a settlement of this
    matter with the IRS. As a result of the settlement in the first
    quarter ended October 30, 2005, the company adjusted tax
    reserves and recorded a $47 tax benefit. In addition, the
    company reduced interest expense and accrued interest payable by
    $21 and adjusted deferred tax expense by $8 ($13 after tax). The
    aggregate non-cash impact of the settlement on Earnings from
    continuing operations was $60, or $.14 per share. The settlement
    did not have a material impact on the company’s
    consolidated cash flow. In 2006, the company also recognized an
    additional tax benefit of $21 related to the resolution of
    certain U.S. tax issues for open tax years through 2001.

At August 3, 2008,

    and $127 may be carried forward indefinitely. The current
    statutory tax rates in these countries range from 20% to 31%. At
    August 3, 2008, valuation allowances have been established
    to offset $51 of these tax loss carryforwards. Additionally, at
    August 3, 2008,

non-U.S. subsidiaries

of the company have capital loss carryforwards of approximately
    $346, which are fully offset by valuation allowances. The
    company also has approximately $2 of foreign tax credit
    carryforwards, which expire in 2018.

The company has undistributed earnings of

non-U.S. subsidiaries

of approximately $315. U.S. income taxes have not been
    provided on undistributed earnings, which are deemed to be
    permanently reinvested. It is not practical to estimate the tax
    liability that might be incurred if such earnings were remitted
    to the U.S.

    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” as of
    July 30, 2007 (the beginning of fiscal 2008). The company
    identified approximately $58 of unrecognized tax benefits as of
    July 30, 2007, of which $42 would impact the effective rate
    if

    penalties of approximately $9 (net of a tax benefit of $2). Upon
    adoption, the company recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment
    of $6 as an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits, including interest and penalties, and a corresponding
    reduction in retained earnings. A reconciliation of the activity

The balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of August 3,
    2008 was $54, of which $37 would impact the effective tax rate
    if recognized in future periods. The total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements,
    tax examination activities, statute expirations and the
    recognition and measurement criteria under FIN 48. The
    company is unable to estimate what this change could be within
    the next twelve months, but does not believe it would be
    material to the financial statements.

Approximately $2 of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities,
    including interest and penalties, are expected to be settled
    within the next twelve months and are classified in accrued
    income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining
    $59 of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities are reported as
    other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The company’s accounting policy with respect to interest
    and penalties attributable to income taxes is to reflect any
    expense or benefit as a component of its income tax provision.
    The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the
    current year Statement of Earnings was a benefit of $4. The
    total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of August 3, 2008 was $7 (net
    of a tax benefit of $2).

The company does business globally and, as a result, files
    income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and
    various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of
    business, the company is subject to examination by taxing
    authorities throughout the world, including such major
    jurisdictions as the United States, Australia, Canada, Belgium,
    France and Germany. The tax years 2005 and 2006 are currently
    under audit by the IRS. In addition, several state income tax
    examinations are in progress for fiscal years 2000 to 2007.

In Australia, the company has been subject to a limited scope
    audit by the Australian tax office for fiscal years through
    2002. The statue of limitation is open for fiscal years 2003
    forward. With limited exceptions, the company is no longer
    subject to income tax audits in Canada for fiscal years before
    2004. The company is no longer subject to income tax audits for
    fiscal years 2005 and prior for Belgium and France, and for
    fiscal years 2007 and prior for Germany.

Financial
    Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and
    notes receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt
    approximate fair value. The fair values of long-term debt, as
    indicated in Note 11, and derivative financial instruments
    are based on quoted market prices or pricing models using
    current market rates.

The company accounts for derivatives under
    SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” as amended by
    SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149. The standard
    requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the
    balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for
    designation and effectiveness of the hedging relationships.

The company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to
    enhance its ability to manage risk, including interest rate,
    foreign currency, commodity and certain equity-linked deferred
    compensation exposures that exist as part of ongoing business
    operations. Derivative instruments are entered into for periods
    consistent with related underlying exposures and do not
    constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company
    does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes, nor is
    it a party to any leveraged derivative instrument.

The company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties on derivative contracts.
    The company minimizes its credit risk on these transactions by
    dealing only with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions
    having long-term credit ratings of “A” or better and,
    therefore, does not anticipate nonperformance. In addition, the
    contracts are distributed among several financial institutions,
    thus minimizing credit risk concentration.

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair
    value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the
    company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the
    fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an
    unrecognized firm commitment (fair-value hedge), (2) a
    hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset
    or liability (cash-flow hedge), (3) a foreign-currency
    fair-value or cash-flow hedge (foreign-currency hedge), or
    (4) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
    Some derivatives may also be considered natural hedging
    instruments (changes in fair value are recognized to act as
    economic offsets to changes in fair value of the underlying
    hedged item and do not qualify for hedge accounting under
    SFAS No. 133).

Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the
    loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is
    attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on
    firm commitments), are recorded in current-period earnings.
    Changes in the fair value of a cash-flow hedge are recorded in
    other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the
    variability of cash flows. Changes in the fair value of a
    foreign-currency hedge are recorded in either current-period
    earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the
    hedge transaction is a fair-value hedge (e.g., a hedge of a firm
    commitment that is to be settled in foreign currency) or a
    cash-flow hedge (e.g., a hedge of a foreign-currency-denominated
    forecasted transaction). If, however, a derivative is used as a
    hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its changes in
    fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in
    the cumulative translation adjustments account within
    Shareowners’ equity.

The company finances a portion of its operations through debt
    instruments primarily consisting of commercial paper, notes,
    debentures and bank loans. The company utilizes interest rate
    swap agreements to minimize worldwide financing costs and to
    achieve a targeted ratio of variable-rate versus fixed-rate debt.

In June 2008, the company entered into two forward starting
    interest rate swap contracts with a combined notional value of
    $200 to hedge an anticipated debt offering in fiscal 2009.

In June 2008, the company terminated an interest rate swap
    contract with a notional value of $33 that converted variable
    Australian debt to fixed. The amount received was not material.

In July 2006, the company entered into three interest rate swaps
    that converted $154 of the $207 Australian variable-rate debt to
    a weighted-average fixed rate of 6.73%, all of which have been
    settled as of August 3, 2008.

Fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps are accounted for as
    fair-value hedges. Gains and losses on these instruments are
    recorded in earnings as adjustments to interest expense,
    offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item. The notional
    amount of fair-value interest rate swaps was $675 at
    August 3, 2008 and at July 29, 2007. The swaps had a
    fair value of a gain of $14 at August 3, 2008 and a loss of
    $19 at July 29, 2007.

Variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as
    cash-flow hedges. Consequently, the effective portion of
    unrealized gains (losses) is deferred as a component of
    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is recognized
    in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings. The
    amounts paid or received on the hedge are recognized as
    adjustments to interest expense. There were no variable-to-fixed
    interest rate swaps outstanding as of August 3, 2008. The
    fair value of the swaps was not material as of July 29,
    2007. The notional amount was $85 at July 29, 2007.

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a
    result of transactions in currencies other than the functional
    currency of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary financing
    transactions. The company utilizes foreign currency forward
    purchase and sale contracts and cross-currency swaps in order to
    manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases
    and sales and certain intercompany transactions in the normal
    course of business.

Qualifying foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap
    contracts are accounted for as cash-flow hedges when the hedged
    item is a forecasted transaction, or when future cash flows
    related to a recognized asset or liability are expected to be
    received or paid. The effective portion of the changes in fair
    value on these instruments is recorded in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into the
    Statements of Earnings on the same line item and in the same
    period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects
    earnings. The assessment of effectiveness for contracts is based
    on changes in the spot rates. The fair value of these
    instruments was a loss of $68 and $56 at August 3, 2008 and
    July 29, 2007, respectively. The notional amount was $307
    and $437 as of August 3, 2008 and July 29, 2007,
    respectively.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Qualifying foreign exchange forward contracts are accounted for
    as fair-value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset,
    liability or firm commitment. These contracts were not material
    at July 29, 2007. There were no such contracts outstanding
    as of August 3, 2008.

The company also enters into certain foreign exchange forward
    contracts and variable-to-variable cross-currency swap contracts
    that are not designated as accounting hedges. These instruments
    are primarily intended to reduce volatility of certain
    intercompany financing transactions. Gains and losses on
    derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are typically
    recorded in Other expenses/(income), as an offset to gains
    (losses) on the underlying transactions. Cross-currency
    contracts mature in 2009 through 2014. The fair value of these
    instruments was a loss of $48 and $10 at August 3, 2008 and
    July 29, 2007, respectively. The notional amount of all
    instruments was $582 and $331 at August 3, 2008 and
    July 29, 2007, respectively.

Foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of
    less than eighteen months. Principal currencies include the
    Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, euro,
    Japanese yen, New Zealand dollar and Swedish krona.

As of August 3, 2008, the accumulated derivative net gain
    in other comprehensive income for cash-flow hedges, including
    the foreign exchange forward and cross-currency contracts,
    forward-starting swap contracts and treasury lock agreements and
    commodity futures, was $5, net of tax. As of July 29, 2007,
    the accumulated derivative net loss in other comprehensive
    income was $6, net of tax. At August 3, 2008, the maximum
    maturity date of any cash-flow hedge was approximately
    5 years. The amount expected to be reclassified into the
    Statements of Earnings in 2009 is a gain of approximately $5.

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders
    and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in
    connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain
    commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters
    into commodity futures contracts, as considered appropriate, to
    reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities such
    as soybean oil, wheat, soybean meal, corn, cocoa and natural
    gas. As of August 3, 2008, the notional value and the fair
    value loss related to commodity hedging activity were $146 and
    $3, respectively.

The company is exposed to equity price changes related to
    certain deferred compensation obligations. Swap contracts are
    utilized to hedge exposures relating to certain deferred
    compensation obligations linked to the total return of the
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the total return of
    the company’s capital stock and the total return of the
    Puritan Fund. The company pays a variable interest rate and
    receives the equity returns under these instruments. The
    notional value of the equity swap contracts, which mature in
    2009, was $56 at August 3, 2008. These instruments are not
    designated as accounting hedges. Gains and losses are recorded
    in the Statements of Earnings as an offset to gains and losses
    on the underlying transactions. The net asset recorded under
    these contracts at August 3, 2008 was $1.

Shareowners’
    Equity

The company has authorized 560 million shares of Capital
    stock with $.0375 par value and 40 million shares of
    Preferred stock, issuable in one or more classes, with or
    without par as may be authorized by the Board of Directors. No
    Preferred stock has been issued.

Share
    Repurchase Programs

In November 2005, the company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the purchase of up to $600 of company stock through
    fiscal 2008. This program was completed during the third quarter
    of 2008. In August 2006, the company’s Board of Directors
    authorized using up to $620 of the net proceeds from the sale of
    the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to purchase company
    stock. This program was completed at the end of fiscal 2007. In
    March 2008, the company’s Board of Directors authorized
    using approximately $600 of the net proceeds from the sale of
    the Godiva Chocolatier business to purchase company stock. This
    program was completed during the fourth quarter of 2008. In June
    2008, the company’s Board of Directors authorized the
    purchase of up to $1,200 of company stock through fiscal 2011.
    This program will begin in fiscal 2009. In addition to these
    publicly announced programs, the company



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

repurchases shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares
    issued under the company’s stock compensation plans.

In 2008, the company repurchased 26 million shares at a
    cost of $903. Of the 2008 repurchases, approximately
    23 million shares at a cost of $800 were made pursuant to
    the company’s publicly announced share repurchase programs.

In 2007, the company repurchased 30 million shares at a
    cost of $1,140. Of the 2007 repurchases, approximately
    21 million shares at a cost of $820 were made pursuant to
    the company’s then publicly announced share repurchase
    programs, with a portion executed under two accelerated share
    repurchase agreements (Agreements) with Lehman Brothers
    Financial S.A. (Lehman), an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc.,
    covering approximately $600 of common stock. The Agreements were
    entered into on September 28, 2006.

Under the first Agreement, the company purchased approximately
    8.3 million shares of its common stock from Lehman for
    $300, or $35.95 per share, subject to a purchase price
    adjustment payable upon settlement of the Agreement. Lehman was
    expected to purchase an equivalent number of shares during the
    term of the Agreement. On July 5, 2007, upon conclusion of
    the Agreement, the company made a settlement payment of $22 to
    Lehman, which was recorded as a reduction of Additional paid-in
    capital, based upon the difference between the volume
    weighted-average price of the company’s common stock during
    the Agreement’s term of $38.90 and the purchase price of
    $35.95.

Under the second Agreement, the company purchased approximately
    $300 of its common stock from Lehman. Under this Agreement,
    Lehman made an initial delivery of 6.3 million shares on
    September 29, 2006 at $35.95 per share and a second
    delivery of 1.3 million shares on October 25, 2006 at
    $36.72 per share. Under the Agreement, the number of additional
    shares (if any) to be delivered to the company at settlement
    would be based on the volume weighted-average price of company
    stock during the term of the Agreement, subject to a minimum and
    maximum price for the purchased shares. The volume
    weighted-average price during the term of the Agreement was
    $38.90. On July 5, 2007, upon conclusion of the Agreement,
    Lehman delivered approximately 200,000 shares to the
    company as a final settlement. Approximately $20 paid under the
    Agreement was recorded as a reduction of Additional paid-in
    capital.

Stock
    Plans

In 2003, shareowners approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan,
    which authorized the issuance of 28 million shares to
    satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
    unrestricted stock, restricted stock (including performance
    restricted stock) and performance units. Approximately
    3.2 million shares available under a previous long-term
    plan were rolled into the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, making
    the total number of available shares approximately
    31.2 million. In November 2005, shareowners approved the
    2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of
    an additional 6 million shares to satisfy the same types of
    awards.

Awards under the 2003 and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans may be
    granted to employees and directors. The term of a stock option
    granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date
    of grant. Options granted under these plans vest cumulatively
    over a three-year period at a rate of 30%, 60% and 100%,
    respectively. The option price may not be less than the fair
    market value of a share of common stock on the date of the
    grant. Restricted stock granted in fiscal 2004 and 2005 vests in
    three annual installments of


/


each, beginning


/


years from the date of grant.

Pursuant to the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, in July 2005 the
    company adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which
    provides for grants of total shareowner return (TSR) performance
    restricted stock, EPS performance restricted stock, and
    time-lapse restricted stock. Initial grants made in accordance
    with this program were approved in September 2005. Under the
    program, awards of TSR performance restricted stock will be
    earned by comparing the company’s total shareowner return
    during a three-year period to the respective total shareowner
    returns of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon the
    company’s ranking in the performance peer group, a
    recipient of TSR performance restricted stock may earn a total
    award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of
    EPS performance restricted stock will be earned based upon the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

company’s achievement of annual earnings per share goals.
    During the three-year vesting period, a recipient of EPS
    performance restricted stock may earn a total award ranging from
    0% to 100% of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted
    stock will vest ratably over the three-year period. Annual stock
    option grants are not part of the long-term incentive
    compensation program for 2006, 2007 and 2008. However, stock
    options may still be granted on a selective basis under the 2003
    and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans.

    related to unvested stock options was not material. There were
    no options granted during 2008 and 2007. Options granted in 2006
    were not material. The weighted-average fair value of options
    granted in 2006 was estimated as $6.85. The fair value of each

    2008 is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
    period, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible
    participants, which are expensed on an accelerated basis. EPS
    performance restricted stock is expensed on a graded-vesting
    basis, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible
    participants, which are expensed on an accelerated basis.

The fair value of TSR performance restricted stock is estimated
    at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. Expense is
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period. As
    of August 3, 2008, total remaining unearned compensation
    related to TSR performance restricted stock was $43 which will
    be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period
    of 1.8 years. The grant-date fair value of TSR performance
    restricted stock granted during 2007 and 2006 was $26.31 and
    $28.73, respectively.

Employees can elect to defer all types of restricted stock
    awards. These awards are classified as liabilities because of
    the possibility that they may be settled in cash. The fair value
    is adjusted quarterly. The total cash paid to settle the
    liabilities in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was not material. The
    liability for deferred awards was $19 at August 3, 2008.

The excess tax benefits on the exercise of stock options and
    vested restricted stock presented as cash flows from financing
    activities in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $8, $25 and $11,
    respectively. Cash received from the exercise of stock options
    was $47, $165 and $236 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
    and is reflected in cash flows from financing activities in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

For the periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of
    Earnings, the calculations of basic earnings per share and
    earnings per share assuming dilution vary in that the weighted
    average shares outstanding assuming dilution include the
    incremental effect of stock options and restricted stock
    programs, except when such effect would be antidilutive. The
    dilutive impact of the accelerated share repurchase agreements
    described under “Share Repurchase Programs” was not
    material. Stock options to purchase approximately 1 million
    shares of capital stock for 2008 and for 2007 and 3 million
    shares of capital stock for 2006 were not included in the
    calculation for diluted earnings per share because the exercise
    price of the stock options exceeded the average market price of
    the capital stock, and therefore, would be antidilutive.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

In February 2002, VFB L.L.C., an entity representing the
    interests of the unsecured creditors of Vlasic Foods
    International Inc., a company spun off by Campbell in March
    1998, commenced a lawsuit against the company and several of its
    subsidiaries in the United States District Court for the
    District of Delaware alleging, among other things, fraudulent
    conveyance, illegal dividends and breaches of fiduciary duty by
    Vlasic directors alleged to be under the company’s control.
    In September 2005, the District Court ruled in favor of
    Campbell, finding that Vlasic Foods was solvent at the time of
    the spin off transaction, and that Campbell is not liable to the
    plaintiff for the claims of Vlasic’s unsecured creditors or
    for any other claims or damages. The judgment of the District
    Court was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the
    Third Circuit in March of 2007. The case is closed.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The company is a party to legal proceedings and claims arising
    out of the normal course of business.

Management assesses the probability of loss for all legal
    proceedings and claims and has recognized liabilities for such
    contingencies, as appropriate. Although the results of these
    matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in management’s
    opinion, the final outcome of legal proceedings and claims will
    not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results
    of operations or financial condition of the company.

The company has certain operating lease commitments, primarily
    related to warehouse and office facilities, retail store space
    and certain equipment. Rent expense under operating lease
    commitments was $80 in 2008 and $82 in 2007 and in 2006. These
    amounts included $33, $42 and $41 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, related to discontinued operations. Future minimum
    annual rental payments under these operating leases are as
    follows:






Thereafter

$35

$30

$25

$23

$51

The company guarantees approximately 1,800 bank loans made to
    Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party
    financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes.
    The maximum potential amount of future payments the company
    could be required to make under the guarantees is $151. The
    company’s guarantees are indirectly secured by the
    distribution routes. The company does not believe it is probable
    that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result
    of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. The amounts recognized
    as of August 3, 2008 and July 29, 2007 were not
    material.

In connection with the sale of certain Australian salty snack
    food brands and assets, the company agreed to provide a loan
    facility to the buyer of AUD $10, or approximately USD $9. The
    facility can be drawn down in AUD $5 increments, six and nine
    months after the closing date, which was May 12, 2008. Any
    borrowings under the facility are to be repaid five years after
    the closing date.

The company has provided certain standard indemnifications in
    connection with divestitures, contracts and other transactions.
    Certain indemnifications have finite expiration dates.
    Liabilities recognized based on known exposures related to such
    matters were not material at August 3, 2008.

Reports
    of Management

Management’s
    Report on Financial Statements

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the
    company’s management in conformity with generally accepted
    accounting principles to reflect the financial position of the
    company and its operating results. The financial information
    appearing throughout this Annual Report is consistent with the
    financial statements. Management is responsible for the
    information and representations in such financial statements,
    including the estimates and judgments required for their
    preparation. The financial statements have been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
    entirely of Directors who are not officers or employees of the
    company, meets regularly with the company’s worldwide
    internal auditing department, other management personnel, and
    the independent auditors. The independent auditors and the
    internal auditing department have had, and continue to have,
    direct access to the Audit Committee without the presence of
    other management personnel, and have been directed to discuss
    the results of their audit work and any matters they believe
    should be brought to the Committee’s attention. The
    internal auditing department and the independent auditors report
    directly to the Audit Committee.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America.

The company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    Directors of the company; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
    the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
    the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    August 3, 2008. In making this assessment, management used
    the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on this
    assessment using those criteria, management concluded that the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of August 3, 2008.



The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of August 3, 2008 has been audited
    by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareowners and Directors of Campbell Soup Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of earnings, of
    shareowners’ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Campbell Soup
    Company and its subsidiaries at August 3, 2008 and
    July 29, 2007, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
    period ended August 3, 2008 in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of August 3, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report
    on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 and Note 9, the company changed
    the manner in which it accounts for uncertainty in income taxes
    in 2008, and the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement plans in 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Controls
    and Procedures

The company, under the supervision and with the participation of
    its management, including the President and Chief Executive
    Officer and Vice President — Controller (Principal
    Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer), has
    evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the

    “Evaluation Date”). Based on such evaluation, the
    President and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice
    President — Controller (Principal Financial Officer
    and Principal Accounting Officer) have concluded that, as of the
    Evaluation Date, the company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective.

During the quarter ended August 3, 2008, as part of the
    previously announced North American SAP enterprise-resource
    planning system implementation, the company implemented SAP
    software at its Napoleon, Ohio, facility and at its Pepperidge
    Farm facility in Denver, Pennsylvania. In conjunction with these
    SAP implementations, the company modified the design, operation
    and documentation of its internal control over financial
    reporting. Specifically, the company modified controls in the
    business processes impacted by the new system, such as user
    access security, system reporting and authorization and
    reconciliation procedures. There were no other changes in the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting that
    materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially
    affect, such internal control over financial reporting.
