PART I

Item 1.

Business

The
    Company

Campbell Soup Company (“Campbell” or the
    “company”), together with its consolidated
    subsidiaries, is a global manufacturer and marketer of
    high-quality, branded convenience food products. Campbell was
    incorporated as a business corporation under the laws of New
    Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through predecessor
    organizations, it traces its heritage in the food business back
    to 1869. The company’s principal executive offices are in
    Camden, New Jersey

08103-1799.

In fiscal 2009, the company continued its focus on delivering
    superior long-term total shareowner returns by executing against
    the following seven key strategies:

•

Expanding the company’s icon brands within simple meals,
    baked snacks and healthy beverages;

•

Driving higher levels of consumer satisfaction by offering
    superior value and focusing on wellness, quality and convenience;

•

Making the company’s products more broadly available in
    existing and new markets;

•

Strengthening the company’s business through outside
    partnerships and acquisitions;

•

Increasing margins by improving price realization and
    company-wide productivity;

•

Improving overall organizational excellence, diversity,
    engagement and innovation; and

•

Advancing a powerful commitment to sustainability and corporate
    social responsibility.

For additional information relating to the company’s seven
    key strategies, see “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”

The company’s operations are organized and reported in the
    following segments: U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages; Baking
    and Snacking; International Soup, Sauces and Beverages; and
    North America Foodservice. The segments are discussed in greater
    detail below.

U.S.
    Soup, Sauces and Beverages

The U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment includes the
    following retail businesses:

Campbell’s

condensed
    and ready-to-serve soups;

Swanson

broth, stocks and
    canned poultry;

Prego

pasta sauce;

Pace

Mexican
    sauce;

Campbell’s

canned pasta, gravies, and beans;

V8

juice and juice drinks;

Campbell’s

tomato
    juice; and

The Baking and Snacking segment includes the following
    businesses:

Pepperidge Farm

cookies, crackers, bakery and
    frozen products in U.S. retail;

Arnott’s

biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific; and

Arnott’s

salty snacks in Australia. As previously discussed, in May
    2008, the company completed the divestiture of certain salty
    snack food brands and assets in Australia, which were
    historically included in this segment.

International
    Soup, Sauces and Beverages

The International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment includes
    the soup, sauce and beverage businesses outside of the United
    States, including Europe, Latin America, the Asia Pacific
    region, as well as the emerging markets of Russia and China, and
    the retail business in Canada. The segment’s operations
    include

Erasco

and

Heisse Tasse

soups in Germany,

Liebig

and

Royco

soups in France,

Devos Lemmens

mayonnaise and cold sauces and

Campbell’s

and

Royco

soups in Belgium, and

Blå Band

soups
    and sauces in Sweden. In Asia Pacific, operations include

Campbell’s

soup and stock,

Swanson

broths,

V8

beverages and

Prego

pasta sauce. In Canada,
    operations include

Habitant

and

Campbell’s

soups,

Prego

pasta sauce,

V8

beverages and
    certain Pepperidge Farm products.


The French sauce and mayonnaise business, which was marketed
    under the

Lesieur

brand and divested on
    September 29, 2008, was historically included in this
    segment.

North
    America Foodservice

The North America Foodservice segment includes the
    company’s Away From Home operations, which represent the
    distribution of products such as soup, specialty entrees,
    beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm
    products through various food service channels in the United
    States and Canada.

Ingredients

The ingredients required for the manufacture of the
    company’s food products are purchased from various
    suppliers. While all such ingredients are available from
    numerous independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to
    fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors,
    including changes in crop size, cattle cycles, product scarcity,
    demand for raw materials and energy costs, government-sponsored
    agricultural programs, import and export requirements and
    weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons. To
    help reduce some of this price volatility, the company uses
    various commodity risk management tools for a number of its
    ingredients and commodities, such as natural gas, heating oil,
    wheat, soybean oil, cocoa, aluminum and corn. Ingredient
    inventories are at a peak during the late fall and decline
    during the winter and spring. Since many ingredients of suitable
    quality are available in sufficient quantities only at certain
    seasons, the company makes commitments for the purchase of such
    ingredients during their respective seasons. At this time, the
    company does not anticipate any material restrictions on
    availability or shortages of ingredients that would have a
    significant impact on the company’s businesses. For
    information on the impact of inflation on the company, see
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of
    Operations and Financial Condition.”

Customers

In most of the company’s markets, sales activities are
    conducted by the company’s own sales force and through
    broker and distributor arrangements. In the United States,
    Canada and Latin America, the company’s products are
    generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass
    discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience
    stores, drug stores, dollar stores and other retail, commercial
    and non-commercial establishments. In Europe, the company’s
    products are generally resold to consumers in retail food
    chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores,
    convenience stores and other retail, commercial and
    non-commercial establishments. In the Asia Pacific region, the
    company’s products are generally resold to consumers
    through retail food chains, convenience stores and other retail,
    commercial and non-commercial establishments. The company makes
    shipments promptly after receipt and acceptance of orders.

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and
    its affiliates, accounted for approximately 18% of the
    company’s consolidated net sales during fiscal 2009 and 16%
    during fiscal 2008. All of the company’s segments sold
    products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates. No other
    customer accounted for 10% or more of the company’s
    consolidated net sales.

Trademarks
    And Technology

As of September 15, 2009, the company owned over 4,100
    trademark registrations and applications in over 160 countries
    and believes that its trademarks are of material importance to
    its business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks
    generally are valid as long as they are in use

and/or

their
    registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to
    have become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be
    renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. The
    company believes that its principal brands, including

Campbell’s

,

Erasco

,

Liebig

,

Pepperidge Farm

,

V8

,

Pace

,

Prego

,

Swanson

, and

Arnott’s,

are protected by
    trademark law in the company’s relevant major markets. In
    addition, some of the company’s products are sold under
    brands that have been licensed from third parties.

Although the company owns a number of valuable patents, it does
    not regard any segment of its business as being dependent upon
    any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, the
    company owns copyrights, both



registered and unregistered, and proprietary trade secrets,
    technology, know-how processes, and other intellectual property
    rights that are not registered.

Competition

The company experiences worldwide competition in all of its
    principal products. This competition arises from numerous
    competitors of varying sizes, including producers of generic and
    private label products, as well as from manufacturers of other
    branded food products, which compete for trade merchandising
    support and consumer dollars. As such, the number of competitors
    cannot be reliably estimated. The principal areas of competition
    are brand recognition, quality, price, advertising, promotion,
    convenience and service.

Working
    Capital

For information relating to the company’s cash and working
    capital items, see “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”

Capital
    Expenditures

During fiscal 2009, the company’s aggregate capital
    expenditures were $345 million. The company expects to
    spend approximately $350 million for capital projects in
    fiscal 2010. The anticipated major fiscal 2010 capital projects
    include the previously announced expansion and enhancement of
    the company’s corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey,
    implementation of a SAP enterprise-resource planning system in
    the company’s Australian and New Zealand locations and
    expansion of the company’s Australian and United States
    cracker production capacity.

Research
    And Development

During the last three fiscal years, the company’s
    expenditures on research activities relating to new products and
    the improvement and maintenance of existing products for
    continuing operations were $114 million in 2009,
    $115 million in 2008 and $111 million in 2007. The
    decrease from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to the impact of
    currency. The increase from 2007 to 2008 was also primarily due
    to the impact of currency. The company conducts this research
    primarily at its headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, although
    important research is undertaken at various other locations
    inside and outside the United States.

Environmental
    Matters

The company has requirements for the operation and design of its
    facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules
    and regulations. Of the company’s $345 million in
    capital expenditures made during fiscal 2009, approximately
    $5 million was for compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations in the United States. The company further estimates
    that approximately $6 million of the capital expenditures
    anticipated during fiscal 2010 will be for compliance with
    United States environmental laws and regulations. The company
    believes that continued compliance with existing environmental
    laws and regulations will not have a material effect on capital
    expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the
    company.

Seasonality

Demand for the company’s products is somewhat seasonal,
    with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the
    highest sales volume due primarily to demand for the
    company’s soup products. Demand for the company’s
    sauce, beverage, baking and snacking products, however, is
    generally evenly distributed throughout the year.

Regulation

The manufacture and marketing of food products is highly
    regulated. In the United States, the company is subject to
    regulation by various government agencies, including the Food
    and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
    and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as various state and
    local agencies. The company is also regulated by similar
    agencies outside the United States and by voluntary
    organizations such as the National



Advertising Division and the Children’s Food and Beverage
    Advertising Initiative of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.

Employees

On August 2, 2009, there were approximately
    18,700 employees of the company.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report,
    the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely
    affect the company’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known to the company or that the company currently
    deems immaterial also may impair the company’s business
    operations and financial condition.

The
    company operates in a highly competitive industry

The company operates in the highly competitive food industry and
    experiences worldwide competition in all of its principal
    products. The principal areas of competition are brand
    recognition, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience
    and service. A number of the company’s primary competitors
    have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. A
    strong competitive response from one or more of these
    competitors to the company’s marketplace efforts, or a
    consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in
    the company reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other
    expenditures, or losing market share.

The
    company faces risks related to recession, financial and credit
    market disruptions and other economic conditions

Customer and consumer demand for the company’s products may
    be impacted by recession or other economic downturns in the
    United States or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in
    financial and credit markets may impact the company’s
    ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its
    customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in any
    one of the following factors in the United States or other
    nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market
    disruptions or other reasons, could impact the company: currency
    exchange rates, tax rates, interest rates or equity markets.

Fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the
    company’s results

The company holds assets and incurs liabilities, earns revenue,
    and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar, primarily the Australian dollar, Canadian
    dollar, and the euro. The company’s consolidated financial
    statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and therefore the
    company must translate its assets, liabilities, revenue, and
    expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes.
    As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may
    materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the
    company’s consolidated financial statements, even if their
    value has not changed in their original currency.



The
    company’s results may be adversely impacted by increases in
    the price of raw and packaging materials

The raw and packaging materials used in the company’s
    business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry,
    vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these
    materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of
    factors, including product scarcity, demand for raw materials,
    commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency
    fluctuations, weather conditions, import and export requirements
    and changes in government-sponsored agricultural programs. To
    the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and
    packaging material prices, the company may not be able to offset
    such increases through productivity or price increases or
    through its commodity hedging activity.

The
    company’s results are dependent on successful marketplace
    initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the company’s
    products

The company’s results are dependent on successful
    marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the
    company’s products. The company’s product
    introductions and product improvements, along with its other
    marketplace initiatives, are designed to capitalize on new
    customer or consumer trends. In order to remain successful, the
    company must anticipate and react to these new trends and
    develop new products or processes to address them. While the
    company devotes significant resources to meeting this goal, the
    company may not be successful in developing new products or
    processes, or its new products or processes may not be accepted
    by customers or consumers.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and
    costs related to its defined benefit pension plans

The company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans
    for employees in the United States and various foreign
    locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded
    with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio
    of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory
    requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment
    returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the
    funded status of the company’s defined benefit pension
    plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost,
    future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status
    as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in the
    company’s obligations or future funding requirements could
    have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the
    company.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by the increased significance
    of some of its customers

The retail grocery trade continues to consolidate. These
    consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with
    increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek
    lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their
    suppliers. These customers may also in the future use more of
    their shelf space, currently used for our products, for their
    private label products. If the company is unable to use its
    scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category
    leadership positions to respond to these customer initiatives,
    the company’s business or financial results could be
    negatively impacted. In addition, the disruption of sales to any
    of the company’s large customers for an extended period of
    time could adversely affect the company’s business or
    financial results.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or failure
    of, its information technology systems

Each year the company engages in several billion dollars of
    transactions with its customers and vendors. Because the amount
    of dollars involved is so significant, the company’s
    information technology resources must provide connections among
    its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer
    service, and accounting functions. If the company does not
    allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build
    and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure and to
    maintain the related computerized and manual control processes,
    the company’s business or financial results could be
    negatively impacted.



The
    company may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost
    savings or benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information
    technology or other initiatives

The company’s success is partly dependent upon properly
    executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from,
    its ongoing supply chain, information technology and other
    initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make
    the company more efficient in the manufacture and distribution
    of its products, which is necessary in the company’s highly
    competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a
    failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not
    meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an
    interruption to the company’s sales, manufacturing,
    logistics, customer service or accounting functions.

Disruption
    to the company’s supply chain could adversely affect its
    business

Damage or disruption to the company’s suppliers or to the
    company’s manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to
    weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes,
    or other reasons could impair the company’s ability to
    manufacture

and/or

sell
    its products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the
    likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively
    manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is
    sourced from a single location, could adversely affect the
    company’s business or financial results.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully
    execute acquisitions and divestitures

From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or
    divestitures. The success of any such acquisition or divestiture
    depends, in part, upon the company’s ability to identify
    suitable buyers or sellers, negotiate favorable contractual
    terms and, in many cases, obtain governmental approval. For
    acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently
    integrating the acquired business into the company’s
    existing operations. In cases where acquisitions or divestitures
    are not successfully implemented or completed, the
    company’s business or financial results could be negatively
    impacted.

The
    company’s results may be impacted negatively by political
    conditions in the nations where the company does
    business

The company is a global manufacturer and marketer of
    high-quality, branded convenience food products. Because of its
    global reach, the company’s performance may be impacted
    negatively by politically motivated factors, such as unfavorable
    changes in legal or regulatory requirements, tariffs, or export
    and import restrictions, in the nations where it does business.
    The company may also be impacted by political instability, civil
    disobedience, armed hostilities, natural disasters and terrorist
    acts in the nations where it does business.

If the
    company’s food products become adulterated or are
    mislabeled, the company might need to recall those items and may
    experience product liability claims if consumers are
    injured

The company may need to recall some of its products if they
    become adulterated or if they are mislabeled. The company may
    also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes
    injury. A widespread product recall could result in significant
    losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product
    inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product
    for a period of time. The company could also suffer losses from
    a significant product liability judgment against it. A
    significant product recall or product liability case could also
    result in adverse publicity, damage to the company’s
    reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the
    company’s food products.

    the East Brunswick, New Jersey, facility are leased. The
    Utrecht, Netherlands, facility is subject to a ground lease. The
    company also operates retail bakery thrift stores in the United
    States and other plants, facilities and offices at various
    locations in the United States and abroad, including additional
    executive offices in Norwalk, Connecticut, Puurs, Belgium, and
    North Strathfield, Australia. The Dunkirk, France, facility was
    sold during fiscal 2009 as part of the divestiture of the

Lesieur

branded sauce and mayonnaise business. The
    Listowel, Canada, and the Miranda, Australia, facilities were
    closed in fiscal 2009. The company expects to close the Guasave,
    Mexico, facility in fiscal 2010.

Management believes that the company’s manufacturing and
    processing plants are well maintained and are generally adequate
    to support the current operations of the businesses.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition

Overview

Description
    of the Company

Campbell Soup Company is a global manufacturer and marketer of
    high-quality, branded convenience food products. The company is
    organized and reports in the following segments: U.S. Soup,
    Sauces and Beverages; Baking and Snacking; International Soup,
    Sauces and Beverages; and North America Foodservice. See
    Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information on segments.

The company’s well-known brands are sold in approximately
    120 countries. Its principal geographies are North America,
    Australia, France, Germany and Belgium.

Key
    Strategies

To achieve its goals of consistent and sustainable sales and
    earnings growth to deliver superior

long-term

total shareowner returns, the company is focused on executing
    seven strategies:

1. expand its icon brands within simple meals, baked snacks
    and healthy beverages;

2. drive higher levels of consumer satisfaction by offering
    superior value and focusing on wellness, quality and convenience;

3. make its products more broadly available in existing and
    new markets;

4. strengthen its business through outside partnerships and
    acquisitions;

5. increase margins by improving price realization and
    company-wide productivity;

6. improve overall organizational excellence, diversity,
    engagement, and innovation; and

7. advance a powerful commitment to sustainability and
    corporate social responsibility.

Expand the company’s icon brands within simple meals,
    baked snacks and healthy beverages.

The
    company’s overarching business strategy is to drive
    profitable growth by focusing on three large, global
    categories — simple meals, baked snacks, and healthy
    beverages — that are well aligned with consumer
    trends, and are growing in most of the markets in which the
    company does business. Principal brands in these core categories
    include

Campbell’s, Swanson, Pace, Prego, Liebig,
    Erasco, Pepperidge Farm, Goldfish, Arnott’s,

and

V8.

The company has strong market positions in the segments
    within these categories in the geographies in which it competes,
    and its businesses in these categories respond well to product
    innovation and consumer marketing.

Drive higher levels of consumer satisfaction by offering
    superior value and focusing on wellness, quality and
    convenience.

The company continues to pursue
    initiatives designed to meet the growing consumer interest in



health and nutrition. In fiscal 2010, the sodium level in the
    company’s iconic

Campbell’s

condensed tomato
    soup, and in

Campbell’s V8

and

Campbell’s
    Healthy Request

product lines, will be reduced.

Campbell’s Chunky

soups will be restaged with
    “better for you” credentials, including a number of
    varieties with lean meat

and/or

a
    full serving of vegetables, and

Swanson

chicken broth
    will be reformulated to be 100% natural. Responding to consumer
    concerns regarding weight management, the company will launch
    five new or restaged varieties of “light” condensed
    soup in fiscal 2010. In the baked snacks category, Pepperidge
    Farm will introduce

Goldfish

Garden Cheddar crackers
    containing one-third of a serving of vegetables,

Flavor
    Blasted Goldfish

crackers with reduced sodium, and

Goldfish

Grahams with reduced saturated fat.
    Arnott’s has introduced new varieties of its

Vita-weat

crackers with whole-grain goodness. The company continues to
    emphasize the health credentials of many of its other products,
    such as

Prego

sauces and

V8

beverages. In fiscal
    2009, the company also highlighted the value proposition offered
    by many of its products, especially those in its soup portfolio.
    The company expects to continue to emphasize value in its
    marketing and merchandising efforts in fiscal 2010.

Make the company’s products more broadly available in
    existing and new markets.

The company is pursuing
    strategies designed to expand the availability of its products
    in existing markets and to capitalize on opportunities in
    emerging channels and markets around the globe. To further its
    efforts in emerging markets, on May 26, 2009, the company
    announced the entry into an agreement with

Coca-Cola

Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. for the distribution of

Campbell’s Domashnaya Klassika (Campbell’s Home
    Classics)

concentrated broth and other soup products in
    Russia. This arrangement is expected to significantly expand
    distribution of the company’s products in Russia.

Strengthen the company’s business through outside
    partnerships and acquisitions.

The company
    continues to explore opportunities to enhance sales and earnings
    growth through value-creating external development. On
    May 4, 2009, the company completed the acquisition of Ecce
    Panis, Inc., a manufacturer of artisan breads, which has been
    integrated into the company’s Pepperidge Farm bakery
    operations. This acquisition gives the Pepperidge Farm business
    an entry into the fast-growing artisan bread market.

Increase margins by improving price realization and
    company-wide productivity.

The company remains
    focused on increasing margins though a combination of pricing
    and productivity improvements. As part of a series of
    initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term
    profitability announced in fiscal 2008, the company completed
    the closures of its facilities in Listowel, Canada, and Miranda,
    Australia in fiscal 2009. The company also completed the
    implementation of its SAP enterprise-resource planning system in
    most of its North American facilities and has begun to realize
    cost reductions. Finally, the company increased the prices of
    many of its products to offset the impact of significantly
    higher cost inflation, while continuing to generate significant
    cost-savings through ongoing supply chain initiatives and
    control over general and administrative costs.

Improve overall organizational excellence, diversity,
    engagement and innovation.

The company is
    committed to building a diverse, inclusive and engaged workforce
    that is focused on excellence and innovation. In building
    employee engagement, the company emphasizes:
    (1) capabilities, including improving skills, innovation
    capabilities, and manager and team effectiveness; and
    (2) culture, including leadership behavior, workplace
    flexibility and employee wellness. Key focus areas include
    diversity and inclusion, flexible work schedules, and enhanced
    workplace safety.

Advance a powerful commitment to sustainability and corporate
    social responsibility (CSR).

The company has
    developed a comprehensive strategy to advance its commitment to
    corporate social responsibility and sustainability, rooted in
    four key pillars relating to environmental sustainability,
    community outreach, workplace excellence, and consumer concerns
    about wellness and nutrition. Building on a strong heritage of
    corporate citizenship outlined in the company’s first CSR
    Report, “Nourishing People’s Lives,” the company
    is now defining enterprise-wide goals and targets that address
    environmental performance, workplace excellence, social impact
    in its communities, and the nutrition and wellness attributes of
    its product portfolio. The company has established an internal
    governance structure to manage and direct these commitments as
    core business disciplines and is working with its customers and
    suppliers to identify common CSR and environmental
    sustainability priorities. In fiscal 2009, the company also
    joined the United Nations Global Compact and issued formal
    policies in the areas of human rights and political
    accountability.



Basis
    of Presentation

There were 52 weeks in fiscal 2009, 53 weeks in fiscal
    2008 and 52 weeks in fiscal 2007.

In May 2009, the company completed the acquisition of Ecce
    Panis, Inc., an artisan bread maker, for $66 million. The
    business is included in the Baking and Snacking segment. See
    Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

In June 2008, the company acquired the Wolfgang Puck soup
    business for approximately $10 million, of which
    approximately $1 million will be paid in 2010. The company
    also entered into a master licensing agreement with Wolfgang
    Puck Worldwide, Inc. for the use of the

Wolfgang Puck

brand on soup, stock, and broth products in North America
    retail locations. This business is included in the
    U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment. See Note 8 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In July 2008, the company entered into an agreement to sell its
    sauce and mayonnaise business comprised of products sold under
    the

Lesieur

brand in France. The business had annual net
    sales of approximately $70 million. The assets and
    liabilities of this business were reflected as assets and
    liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as
    of August 3, 2008. The sale was completed on
    September 29, 2008 and generated $36 million of
    proceeds. The purchase price was subject to working capital and
    other post-closing adjustments, which resulted in an additional
    $6 million of proceeds. See Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional information.

In the third quarter of 2008, the company entered into an
    agreement to sell certain Australian salty snack food brands and
    assets. The transaction, which was completed on May 12,
    2008, included salty snack brands such as

Cheezels

,

Thins

,

Tasty Jacks

,

French Fries

, and

Kettle Chips

, certain other assets and the assumption of
    liabilities. Proceeds of the sale were nominal. The business had
    annual net sales of approximately $150 million. This
    transaction is included in the restructuring initiatives
    described in Note 7.

In March 2008, the company completed the sale of its Godiva
    Chocolatier business for $850 million, pursuant to a Sale
    and Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The
    purchase price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments,
    which resulted in an additional $20 million of proceeds.
    The company has reflected the results of this business as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    earnings. The company used approximately $600 million of
    the net proceeds to purchase company stock. See Note 3 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In June 2007, the company completed the sale of its ownership
    interest in Papua New Guinea operations for approximately
    $23 million. This business had annual sales of
    approximately $20 million.

In August 2006, the company completed the sale of its businesses
    in the United Kingdom and Ireland for £460 million, or
    approximately $870 million, pursuant to a Sale and Purchase
    Agreement dated July 12, 2006. The United Kingdom and
    Ireland businesses included

Homepride

sauces,

OXO

stock cubes,

Batchelors

soups and

McDonnells

and

Erin

soups. The purchase price was subject to
    certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in an
    additional $19 million of proceeds. The company has
    reflected the results of these businesses as discontinued
    operations in the consolidated statements of earnings. The
    company used approximately $620 million of the net proceeds
    to purchase company stock. See Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional information.

Results
    of Operations


Net earnings were $736 million in 2009, versus
    $1,165 million in 2008. The prior year included a
    $462 million ($1.21 per share) gain from the sale of the
    Godiva Chocolatier business. Net earnings per share were $2.06
    compared to $3.06 a year ago. (All earnings per share amounts
    included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis are
    presented on a diluted basis.)



The following items impacted the comparability of net earnings
    and net earnings per share:

Continuing
    Operations

•

In fiscal 2009, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring
    related costs of $22 million ($15 million after tax or
    $.04 per share) in Cost of products sold associated with the
    previously announced initiatives to improve operational
    efficiency and long-term profitability. These initiatives
    included selling certain salty snack food brands and assets in
    Australia, closing certain production facilities in Australia
    and Canada, and streamlining the company’s management
    structure. In fiscal 2008, the company recorded a pre-tax
    restructuring charge of $175 million ($102 million
    after tax or $.27 per share) and $7 million
    ($5 million after tax or $.01 per share) of accelerated
    depreciation in Cost of products sold. The aggregate impact was
    $182 million ($107 million after tax or $.28 per
    share) related to the initiatives. See Note 7 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and “Restructuring
    Charges” for additional information;

•

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, as part of the
    company’s annual review of intangible assets, an impairment
    charge of $67 million ($47 million after tax or $.13
    per share) was recorded in Other expense/(income) related to
    certain European trademarks, primarily in Germany and the Nordic
    region, used in the International Soup, Sauces and Beverages
    segment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information; and

•

In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the company recognized a
    non-cash tax benefit of $13 million ($.03 per share) from
    the favorable resolution of a state tax contingency in the
    United States.

Discontinued
    Operations

•

In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the company recorded a

Earnings from continuing operations were $732 million in
    2009 ($2.04 per share) and $671 million ($1.76 per share)
    in 2008. After factoring in the items impacting comparability,
    Earnings from continuing operations increased primarily due to
    lower interest expense, lower marketing and selling expenses,
    partially offset by the negative



impact of currency translation. After factoring in the items
    impacting comparability, Earnings per share from continuing
    operations increased due in part to the benefit from a reduction
    in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The
    reduction was primarily due to share repurchases utilizing the
    net proceeds from the divestiture of the Godiva Chocolatier
    business and the company’s strategic share repurchase
    programs. Earnings per share from continuing operations were
    negatively impacted by $.09 from currency translation in 2009.

Earnings from discontinued operations of $4 million in 2009
    represented an adjustment to the tax liability associated with
    the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business. Earnings from
    discontinued operations were $494 million in 2008 and
    included the $462 million gain from the sale of the Godiva
    Chocolatier business. Earnings per share from discontinued
    operations were $.01 in 2009 and $1.30 in 2008. The operations
    of Godiva contributed to earnings of $.08 per share in 2008.


Net earnings were $1,165 million in 2008 ($3.06 per share)
    and $854 million ($2.16 per share) in 2007.

In addition to the 2008 items that impacted the comparability of
    net earnings and net earnings per share, the following items
    also impacted comparability:

Continuing
    Operations

•

In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the company recorded a
    pre-tax non-cash benefit of $20 million ($13 million
    after tax or $.03 per share) from the reversal of legal reserves
    due to favorable results in litigation;

•

In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the company recorded a tax
    benefit of $22 million resulting from the settlement of
    bilateral advance pricing agreements (“APA”) among the
    company, the United States, and Canada related to royalties. In
    addition, the company reduced net interest expense by
    $4 million ($3 million after tax). The aggregate
    impact was $25 million or $.06 per share; and

•

In the second quarter of 2007, the company recorded a pre-tax
    gain of $23 million ($14 million after tax or $.04 per
    share) from the sale of an idle manufacturing facility.

Discontinued
    Operations

•

In 2007, the company recognized a pre-tax gain of
    $39 million ($24 million after tax or $.06 per share)
    from the sale of the businesses in the United Kingdom and
    Ireland. In addition, a tax benefit of $7 million ($.02 per
    share) was recognized from the favorable resolution of tax
    audits in the United Kingdom.

The sum of the individual per share amounts does not equal due
    to rounding.

Earnings from continuing operations were $671 million in
    2008 ($1.76 per share) and $792 million ($2.00 per share)
    in 2007.

After factoring in the items impacting comparability, Earnings
    from continuing operations increased primarily due to higher
    sales, the impact of currency and the benefit of the
    53rd week, partially offset by a reduction of gross margin
    as a percentage of sales and a higher effective tax rate. The
    additional week contributed approximately $.02 per share to
    Earnings from continuing operations in 2008. Earnings per share
    from continuing operations in 2008 also benefited from a
    reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding.

Earnings from discontinued operations were $494 million in
    2008 ($1.30 per share) and $62 million ($.16 per share) in
    2007. After factoring items impacting comparability, earnings at
    Godiva increased slightly.

In 2009, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased
    3%. U.S. soup sales increased 5% as ready-to-serve soup
    sales increased 4%, condensed soup sales increased 5% and broth
    sales increased 9%. The ready-to-serve soup sales increase was
    primarily due to the successful launches of

Campbell’s
    Select Harvest

soups and

Campbell’s V8

soups,
    partially offset by declines in

Campbell’s Chunky

soups. Within ready-to-serve, sales declined in the
    convenience platform, which includes soups in microwavable bowls
    and cups. In condensed, sales increased with growth in cooking
    and in eating varieties. The increase in broth sales was due to
    growth in aseptic varieties and the introduction of

Swanson

stock products. The

Wolfgang Puck

soup, stock and
    broth business acquired in June 2008 contributed modestly to
    U.S. soup sales growth. Beverage sales decreased due to
    declines in

V8

vegetable juice, partially offset by gains
    in

V8 V-Fusion

vegetable and fruit juice.

Prego

pasta sauce sales increased double digits and sales of

Pace

Mexican sauces increased as consumers increased at-home
    eating.

In 2008, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased
    5%. U.S. soup sales increased 2% as condensed soup sales
    increased 1%, ready-to-serve soup sales increased 1%, and broth
    sales increased 12%. The benefit of the 53rd week
    contributed 1% to the U.S. soup sales increase, the
    condensed soup sales increase and the broth sales increase.
    Within condensed soup, gains in cooking varieties were offset by
    declines in eating varieties. In ready-to-serve, sales gains in

Campbell’s Chunky

and

Campbell’s Select

canned soups were partially offset by a decline in the
    convenience platform, which includes soups in microwavable bowls
    and cups. Condensed and ready-to-serve soups benefited from the
    lower sodium varieties.

Swanson

broth sales increased due
    to continued growth of aseptically-packaged varieties. Excluding
    the impact of the 53rd week, beverage sales increased
    double digits, primarily due to consumer demand for healthy
    beverages.

V8

vegetable juice,

V8 V-Fusion

vegetable and fruit juice, and

V8 Splash

juice drinks
    contributed to the sales growth. Sales of

Campbell’s

tomato juice declined. Beverage sales benefited from
    expanded distribution of single-serve beverages due to the
    distribution agreement for refrigerated single-serve



beverages with The

Coca-Cola

Company and

Coca-Cola

Enterprises Inc. Sales of

Prego

pasta sauces and

Pace

Mexican sauces increased.

In 2009, Baking and Snacking sales decreased 10%. Pepperidge
    Farm achieved sales growth with gains in the cookies and
    crackers business, reflecting significant growth in

Pepperidge Farm Goldfish

snack crackers. Arnott’s
    sales declined due to the divestiture of certain salty snack
    food brands in May 2008, the unfavorable impact of currency and
    the impact of one less week in 2009. Excluding these items,
    Arnott’s sales increased due to growth in savory and
    chocolate biscuit products and growth in Indonesia.

In 2008, Baking and Snacking sales increased 11%. Excluding the
    impact of the 53rd week, Pepperidge Farm sales increased
    with growth in all businesses: cookies and crackers, bakery, and
    frozen. The sales increase in the cookies and crackers business
    was primarily due to the growth of

Pepperidge Farm Goldfish

snack crackers, the launch of Baked Naturals, a line of
    adult savory snack crackers, and growth in Distinctive cookie
    varieties. Bakery sales increased driven by gains in whole-grain
    varieties and sandwich rolls. Arnott’s sales increased due
    to the favorable impact of currency, growth in biscuits, and the
    benefit of the 53rd week, partially offset by the
    divestitures of certain salty snack food brands and the business
    in Papua New Guinea.

In 2009, International Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales declined
    16%. In Europe, sales declined due to the divestiture of the
    sauce and mayonnaise business comprised of products sold under
    the

Lesieur

brand in France, the impact of currency, one
    less week in 2009, and lower sales in Germany. In the Asia
    Pacific region, sales declined due to the impact of currency and
    one less week in 2009, partially offset by gains in Malaysia and
    in the Australian soup business. In Canada, sales decreased due
    to currency and one less week in 2009, partially offset by gains
    in the soup business.

In 2008, International Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales
    increased 15%. In Europe, sales increased due to the favorable
    impact of currency, the benefit of the 53rd week, and
    volume gains in Belgium, partially offset by a decline in
    Germany. In the Asia Pacific region, sales increased due to the
    favorable impact of currency, growth in the Australian soup
    business and the benefit of the 53rd week. In Canada, sales
    increased primarily due to the favorable impact of currency, the
    benefit of the 53rd week, and growth in soup and beverages.

In 2009, sales in North America Foodservice declined 9%,
    primarily due to weakness in the food service sector and the
    unfavorable impact of currency.

In 2008, sales in North America Foodservice increased 3%
    primarily due to the benefit of the 53rd week and the
    impact of currency. Excluding the impact of currency and the
    benefit of the 53rd week, sales declined due primarily to
    weakness in the food service sector.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold,
    decreased by $143 million in 2009 from 2008 and increased
    by $170 million in 2008 from 2007. As a percent of sales,
    gross profit was 39.9% in 2009, 39.6% in 2008 and 40.6% in 2007.
    The percentage increase in 2009 was due to higher selling prices
    (approximately 4.4 percentage points), productivity
    improvements (approximately 1.8 percentage points) and mix
    (0.4 percentage point), partially offset by a higher level
    of promotional spending (approximately 1.1 percentage
    points) and the impact of cost inflation and other factors
    (approximately 5.2 percentage points). The percentage point
    decrease in 2008 was due to the impact of cost inflation and
    other factors (approximately 3.8 percentage points), a
    higher level of promotional spending (approximately
    0.5 percentage point), partially offset by higher selling
    prices (approximately 1.5 percentage points), productivity
    improvements (approximately 1.7 percentage points) and mix
    (approximately 0.1 percentage point).

Marketing
    and Selling Expenses

Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 14.2%
    in 2009, 14.5% in 2008 and 15.0% in 2007. Marketing and selling
    expenses decreased 7% in 2009 from 2008. The decrease was
    primarily due to the impact of currency (approximately
    3 percentage points), lower marketing expenses
    (approximately 2 percentage points), and lower selling
    expenses (approximately 2 percentage points). In 2009,
    while advertising expenses increased in U.S. soup to
    support the launch of new products, marketing expenses were
    reduced in other businesses to fund



increased promotional activity. Marketing and selling expenses
    increased 5% in 2008 from 2007. The increase was primarily due
    to the impact of currency (approximately 3 percentage
    points) and higher advertising (approximately 1 percentage
    point).

Administrative
    Expenses

Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.8% in 2009,
    7.6% in 2008 and 7.7% in 2007. Administrative expenses declined
    3% in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to the impact of currency.
    Administrative expenses increased 6% in 2008 from 2007.
    Administrative expenses in 2007 included the reversal of
    $20 million of legal reserves from favorable results in
    litigation, which accounted for approximately 4 percentage
    points of the increase from 2007 to 2008. The remaining increase
    in 2008 was primarily due to the impact of currency
    (approximately 3 percentage points).

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses decreased $1 million or
    1% in 2009 from 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the
    impact of currency (approximately 3 percentage points),
    partially offset by an increase in wages and other costs
    (approximately 2 percentage points). Research and
    development expenses increased $4 million or 4% in 2008
    from 2007. The increase was primarily due to the impact of
    currency (approximately 3 percentage points).

Other
    Expenses/(Income)

Other expense in 2009 included a $67 million impairment
    charge associated with certain European trademarks primarily
    used in Germany and the Nordic region. The charge was recorded
    as a result of the company’s annual review of intangible
    assets and was reflected in the International Soup, Sauces and
    Beverages segment. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Other expense in 2008 included $6 million of impairment
    charges associated with certain trademarks used in the
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment and the pending
    sale of the sauce and mayonnaise business comprised of products
    sold under the

Lesieur

brand in France. See also
    Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other income of $30 million in 2007 included a
    $23 million gain on the sale of an idle manufacturing
    facility, a $10 million gain on a settlement in lieu of
    condemnation of a refrigerated soup facility, and a
    $3 million gain on the sale of the company’s business
    in Papua New Guinea.

    Earnings

Segment operating earnings increased 5% in 2009 from 2008. The
    2009 results included $22 million of restructuring related
    costs and a $67 million impairment charge. The 2008 results
    included $182 million of restructuring charges and related
    costs.

Operating earnings by segment include the effect of a 2008
    restructuring charge and related costs of $182 million as
    follows: Baking and Snacking — $144 million;
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages —
    $9 million; and North America Foodservice —
    $29 million. See Note 7 for additional information.

Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces, and Beverages increased 4%
    in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to pricing, net of increased
    promotional spending, and productivity improvements, which more
    than offset cost inflation and lower sales volume.

Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages increased 3%
    in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher sales volume,
    productivity improvements, and higher price realization,
    partially offset by cost inflation.

Earnings from Baking and Snacking increased from
    $120 million in 2008 to $262 million in 2009. Earnings
    in 2009 included $3 million in accelerated depreciation and
    other exit costs and earnings in 2008 included $144 million
    of restructuring charges related to the initiatives to improve
    operational efficiency and long-term profitability. Excluding
    these items, operating earnings growth in Pepperidge Farm and
    Arnott’s was mostly offset by the negative impact of
    currency and one less week.

Earnings from Baking and Snacking decreased from
    $238 million in 2007 to $120 million in 2008. Earnings
    in 2008 included $144 million in restructuring charges.
    Earnings in 2007 included a $23 million gain from the sale
    of an idle Pepperidge Farm manufacturing facility. Excluding
    these items, the increase in earnings was due to growth in the
    Australian biscuit business, the favorable impact of currency
    and gains in Pepperidge Farm.

Earnings from International Soup, Sauces and Beverages decreased
    from $179 million in 2008 to $69 million in 2009.
    Earnings in 2009 included a $67 million impairment charge
    on certain European trademarks, primarily in Germany and the
    Nordic region. Earnings in 2008 included $9 million of
    restructuring charges related to the initiatives to improve
    operational efficiency and long-term profitability. Excluding
    these items, operating earnings declined, primarily due to the
    impact of currency and costs associated with establishing
    businesses in Russia and China.

Earnings from International Soup, Sauces, and Beverages
    increased 7% in 2008 from 2007. The 2008 earnings included
    $9 million of restructuring charges. Excluding this item,
    operating earnings increased due to the favorable impact of
    currency and growth in Canada and Australia soup, partially
    offset by costs to launch products in Russia and China and
    impairment charges on certain trademarks.

Earnings from North America Foodservice decreased 15% in 2009
    from 2008. Earnings in 2009 included $19 million in
    restructuring related costs and earnings in 2008 included
    $29 million of restructuring charges and costs associated
    with the initiatives to improve operational efficiency and
    long-term profitability. Excluding these items, earnings
    decreased reflecting the reduction in sales.



Earnings from North America Foodservice decreased 49%, or
    $38 million, in 2008 from 2007. Earnings in 2008 included
    $29 million of restructuring charges and related costs.
    Earnings in 2007 included a $10 million gain related to a
    settlement in lieu of condemnation of a refrigerated soup
    facility, which was partially offset by relocation and

start-up

costs associated with the replacement facility. Earnings in 2008
    were also adversely impacted by cost inflation, partially offset
    by higher selling prices and productivity gains.

Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $25 million from
    $132 million in 2008 to $107 million in 2009. The
    decrease was primarily due to lower expenses associated with the
    company’s North American SAP implementation.

Unallocated corporate expenses increased $30 million from
    $102 million in 2007 to $132 million in 2008. The
    increase was primarily due to the reversal of $20 million
    of legal reserves in 2007 due to favorable results in
    litigation, a gain on the sale of the Papua New Guinea business
    in 2007 and an impairment charge in 2008 associated with the
    pending sale of the sauce and mayonnaise business sold under the

Lesieur

brand in France.

Interest
    Expense/Income

Interest expense decreased to $110 million in 2009 from
    $167 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates.
    Interest income declined to $4 million in 2009 from
    $8 million in 2008 primarily due to lower levels of cash
    and cash equivalents.

Interest expense increased 2% in 2008 from 2007. The prior year
    included a $4 million reduction in interest related to the
    APA settlement. The remaining increase was due to a reduction in
    interest in 2007 related to the favorable settlement of
    U.S. federal income tax audits and lower capitalized
    interest, partially offset by lower debt levels. Interest income
    declined to $8 million in 2008 from $19 million in
    2007 primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents.

Taxes
    on Earnings

The effective tax rate was 32.2% in 2009, 28.5% in 2008 and
    27.9% in 2007. The following factors impacted the comparability
    of the tax rate in 2009 versus 2008:

•

In 2009, the company recognized an $11 million benefit
    following the finalization of tax audits.

•

In 2008, the company recognized a tax benefit of
    $75 million on the $182 million pre-tax restructuring
    charge and related costs.

•

In 2008, the company recognized a $13 million benefit from
    the resolution of a state tax contingency.

The effective rate increased in 2009 from 2008 reflecting
    additional tax expense associated with the repatriation of
    foreign earnings. The 2008 effective rate reflects a benefit for
    tax rate changes in foreign jurisdictions.

In 2007, the effective rate was impacted by a $22 million
    benefit from the favorable settlement of the APA among the
    company, the United States and Canada related to royalties. In
    2007, the company also recognized an additional net benefit of
    $40 million, following the finalization of the

2002-2004

U.S. federal tax audits. After factoring in the items
    impacting comparability in 2008 and 2007, the effective rate
    declined in 2008 due in part to a benefit related to tax rate
    changes in foreign jurisdictions.

Restructuring
    Charges

On April 28, 2008, the company announced a series of
    initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term
    profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands
    and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities
    in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the company’s
    management structure. As a result of these initiatives, in 2008,
    the company recorded a restructuring charge of $175 million
    ($102 million after tax or $.27 per share). The charge
    consisted of a net loss of $120 million ($64 million
    after tax) on the sale of certain Australian salty snack food
    brands and assets, $45 million ($31 million after tax)
    of employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated
    impact of curtailment and other pension charges, and
    $10 million ($7 million after tax) of property, plant
    and equipment impairment charges. In addition, approximately
    $7 million ($5 million after



tax or $.01 per share) of costs related to these initiatives
    were recorded in Cost of products sold, primarily representing
    accelerated depreciation on property, plant and equipment. The
    aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and related
    costs in 2008 was $107 million, or $.28 per share. In 2009,
    the company recorded approximately $22 million
    ($15 million after tax or $.04 per share) of costs related
    to these initiatives in Cost of products sold. Approximately
    $17 million of the costs represented accelerated
    depreciation on property, plant and equipment, approximately
    $4 million related to other exit costs and approximately
    $1 million related to employee severance and benefit costs,
    including other pension charges. The company expects to incur
    additional pre-tax costs of approximately $12 million in
    benefit costs related to pension charges. Of the aggregate
    $216 million of pre-tax costs for the total program, the
    company expects approximately $40 million will be cash
    expenditures, the majority of which was spent in 2009. Annual
    pre-tax benefits are expected to be approximately
    $15-$20 million beginning in 2009.

In the third quarter of 2008, as part of the previously
    discussed initiatives, the company entered into an agreement to
    sell certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets. The
    transaction was completed on May 12, 2008. Proceeds of the
    sale were nominal. In connection with this transaction, the
    company recognized a net loss of $120 million
    ($64 million after tax) in 2008. The terms of the agreement
    required the company to provide a loan facility to the buyer of
    AUD $10 million, or approximately USD $7 million. The
    facility was drawn down in AUD $5 million increments in
    2009. Borrowings under the facility are to be repaid five years
    after the closing date. See also Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional information.

In April 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives,
    the company announced plans to close the Listowel, Ontario,
    Canada food plant. The Listowel facility produced primarily
    frozen products, including soup, entrees, and Pepperidge Farm
    products, as well as ramen noodles. The facility employed
    approximately 500 people. The company closed the facility
    in April 2009. Production was transitioned to its network of
    North American contract manufacturers and to its Downingtown,
    Pennsylvania plant. The company recorded $20 million
    ($14 million after tax) of employee severance and benefit
    costs, including the estimated impact of curtailment and other
    pension charges, and $7 million ($5 million after tax)
    in accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment in
    2008. In 2009, the company recorded $1 million of employee
    severance and benefit costs, including other pension charges,
    $16 million ($11 million after tax) in accelerated
    depreciation of property, plant and equipment and
    $2 million ($1 million after tax) of other exit costs.
    The company expects to incur approximately $12 million in
    benefit costs related to pension charges.

In April 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives,
    the company also announced plans to discontinue the private
    label biscuit and industrial chocolate production at its
    Miranda, Australia facility. The company closed the Miranda
    facility, which employed approximately 150 people, in the
    second quarter of 2009. In connection with this action, the
    company recorded $10 million ($7 million after tax) of
    property, plant and equipment impairment charges and
    $8 million ($6 million after tax) in employee
    severance and benefit costs in 2008. In 2009, the company
    recorded $1 million in accelerated depreciation of
    property, plant and equipment and $2 million
    ($1 million after tax) of other exit costs.

As part of the previously discussed initiatives, the company
    streamlined its management structure and eliminated certain
    overhead costs. These actions began in the fourth quarter of
    2008 and were substantially completed in 2009. In connection
    with this action, the company recorded $17 million
    ($11 million after tax) in employee severance and benefit
    costs in 2008.

In aggregate, the company incurred pre-tax costs of
    approximately $204 million in 2008 and in 2009 by segment
    as follows: Baking and Snacking — $147 million,
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages —
    $9 million and North America Foodservice —
    $48 million. Additional pre-tax costs of $12 million
    are expected to be incurred in the North America Foodservice
    segment for benefit costs related to estimated pension charges.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

Discontinued
    Operations

On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its
    Godiva Chocolatier business for $850 million, pursuant to a
    Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The
    purchase price was subject to working



capital and other post-closing adjustments, which resulted in an
    additional $20 million of proceeds. The company has
    reflected the results of this business as discontinued
    operations in the consolidated statements of earnings. The
    company used $600 million of the net proceeds from the sale
    to purchase company stock. In fiscal 2008, the company
    recognized a pre-tax gain of $698 million
    ($462 million after tax or $1.21 per share) on the sale. In
    fiscal 2009, the company recognized a $4 million tax
    benefit as a result of an adjustment to the tax liability
    associated with the sale.

On August 15, 2006, the company completed the sale of its
    businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland for £460, or
    approximately $870 million. The purchase price was subject
    to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in an
    additional $19 million of proceeds. The results of the
    company’s businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland are
    included in discontinued operations. The 2007 results included a
    $24 million after-tax gain, or $.06 per share, on the sale
    of the businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The 2007
    results also included a $7 million tax benefit from the
    favorable resolution of tax audits in the United Kingdom. The
    company used $620 million of the net proceeds from the sale
    of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to purchase company
    stock. The remaining net proceeds were used to settle foreign
    currency hedging contracts associated with intercompany
    financing transactions of the business, to pay taxes and
    expenses associated with the sale, and to repay debt.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The company expects that foreseeable liquidity and capital
    resource requirements, including cash outflows to repurchase
    shares, pay dividends and fund pension plan contributions, will
    be met through cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows
    from operations, long-term borrowings under shelf registration
    statements and short-term borrowings, including commercial
    paper. Over the last three years, operating cash flows totaled
    approximately $2.6 billion. This cash generating capability
    provides the company with substantial financial flexibility in
    meeting its operating and investing needs. The company expects
    that its sources of financing are adequate to meet its future
    liquidity and capital resource requirements. The cost and terms
    of any future financing arrangements may be negatively impacted
    by capital and credit market disruptions and will depend on the
    market conditions and the company’s financial position at
    the time.

Net cash flows from operating activities provided
    $1,166 million in 2009, compared to $766 million in
    2008 due to higher cash earnings and lower tax payments. In
    2008, net cash flows from operations included tax payments
    associated with the divestiture of Godiva.

Net cash flows from operating activities provided
    $766 million in 2008, compared to $674 million in
    2007. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in payments
    to settle foreign currency hedging transactions and lower
    investments in working capital, partially offset by tax payments
    associated with the divestiture of Godiva.

Capital expenditures were $345 million in 2009,
    $298 million in 2008 and $334 million in 2007. Capital
    expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million
    in 2010. Capital expenditures in 2009 included expansion of the
    U.S. beverage production capacity (approximately
    $54 million) and expansion and enhancements of the
    company’s corporate headquarters (approximately
    $20 million). Capital expenditures in 2008 included
    investments to expand the Pepperidge Farm bakery production
    capacity, implement the SAP enterprise-resource



planning system in North America, expand the U.S. beverage
    production capacity, and expand the warehouse at the Maxton,
    North Carolina facility. Capital expenditures in 2007 included
    investments to increase the manufacturing capacity for
    refrigerated soups in a new facility, implement the SAP
    enterprise-resource planning system in North America, and
    implement certain productivity and quality projects in
    manufacturing facilities.

Business acquired, as presented in the Statements of Cash Flows,
    represents the acquisition of the Ecce Panis, Inc. business in
    the fourth quarter of 2009 and the Wolfgang Puck soup business
    in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Net cash provided by investing activities in 2009 includes
    $38 million of proceeds from the sale of the sauce and
    mayonnaise business in France, net of cash divested. Net cash
    provided by investing activities in 2008 includes
    $828 million of proceeds from the sale of the Godiva
    Chocolatier business and certain Australian salty snack food
    brands and assets, net of cash divested. Net cash provided by
    investing activities in 2007 includes $906 million of
    proceeds from the sale of the businesses in the United Kingdom,
    Ireland and Papua New Guinea, net of cash divested.

Long-term borrowings in 2009 included the issuance in January of
    $300 million of 4.5% notes that mature in February
    2019 and the issuance in July of $300 million of
    3.375% notes that mature in August 2014. The net proceeds
    from these issuances were used for the repayment of commercial
    paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. There
    were no new long-term borrowings in 2008 and 2007.

Dividend payments were $350 million in 2009,
    $329 million in 2008 and $308 million in 2007. Annual
    dividends declared in 2009 were $1.00 per share, $.88 per share
    in 2008 and $.80 per share in 2007. The 2009 fourth quarter rate
    was $.25 per share.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares,
    the company repurchased 17 million shares at a cost of
    $527 million during 2009. The majority of these shares were
    repurchased pursuant to the company’s June 2008 publicly
    announced share repurchase program. Under this program, the
    company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up
    to $1.2 billion of company stock through the end of fiscal
    2011. In addition to the June 2008 publicly announced share
    repurchase program, the company also purchased shares to offset
    the impact of dilution from shares issued under the
    company’s stock compensation plans. The company expects to
    continue this practice in the future.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares,
    the company repurchased 26 million shares at a cost of
    $903 million during 2008. During fiscal 2008, the company
    purchased shares pursuant to two publicly announced share
    repurchase programs. Under the first program, which was
    announced on November 21, 2005, the company’s Board of
    Directors authorized the purchase of up to $600 million of
    company stock through the end of fiscal 2008. The November 2005
    program was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
    Under the second program, which was announced on March 18,
    2008, the company’s Board of Directors authorized using
    approximately $600 million of the net proceeds from the
    sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business to purchase company
    stock. The March 2008 program was completed during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition to the publicly announced
    share repurchase programs, the company also purchased shares to
    offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the
    company’s stock compensation plans. Of the 2008
    repurchases, approximately 23 million shares at a cost of
    $800 million were made pursuant to publicly announced share
    repurchase programs. The remaining shares were repurchased to
    offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the
    company’s stock compensation plans.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements on vesting of restricted shares, the
    company repurchased 30 million shares at a cost of
    $1,140 million during 2007. Of the 2007 repurchases,
    approximately 21 million shares at a cost of
    $820 million were made pursuant to the company’s then
    two publicly announced share repurchase programs. The remaining
    shares were repurchased to offset the impact of dilution from
    shares issued under the company’s stock compensation plans.
    The first share repurchase program was the previously discussed
    Board of Directors authorization announced on November 21,
    2005. Under the second share repurchase program, which was
    announced on August 15, 2006, the company’s Board of
    Directors authorized using up to $620 million of the net
    proceeds from the sale of United Kingdom and Ireland businesses
    to purchase company stock. The August 2006 program terminated at
    the end of fiscal 2007. See “Market for Registrant’s
    Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and Issuer Purchases
    of Equity Securities” for more information.



At August 2, 2009, the company had $378 million of
    notes payable due within one year and $27 million of
    standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. The
    company has a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit
    facility maturing in 2011, which was unused at August 2,
    2009, except for $27 million of standby letters of credit.
    This agreement supports the company’s commercial paper
    programs.

In November 2008, the company filed a registration statement
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an
    indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration
    statement, the company may issue debt securities, depending on
    market conditions.

The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its
    revolving credit facilities and debt securities.

Contractual
    Obligations and Other Commitments

Contractual
    Obligations

The following table summarizes the company’s obligations
    and commitments to make future payments under certain
    contractual obligations. For additional information on debt, see
    Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating
    leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office
    facilities and certain equipment. Purchase commitments represent
    purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements related to
    the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment
    and services. These commitments are not expected to have a
    material impact on liquidity. Other long-term liabilities
    primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation
    obligations. For additional information on other long-term
    liabilities, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments

The company guarantees approximately 1,900 bank loans to
    Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party
    financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The
    maximum potential amount of the future payments the company
    could be required to make under the guarantees is
    $159 million. The company’s guarantees are indirectly
    secured by the distribution routes. The company does not believe
    that it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee
    payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed.
    In connection with the sale of certain Australian salty snack
    food brands and assets, the company agreed to provide a loan
    facility to the buyer of AUD $10 million, or approximately
    USD $7 million. The facility was drawn down in AUD
    $5 million increments in 2009. Borrowings under the
    facility are to be repaid five years after the closing date. See
    also Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    information on off-balance sheet arrangements.

Inflation

In fiscal 2008 and 2009, inflation, on average, has been
    significantly higher than recent years. The company uses a
    number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation.
    These strategies include increasing prices, pursuing cost
    productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies,
    commodity hedging and making capital investments that improve
    the efficiency of operations.

Market
    Risk Sensitivity

The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and
    commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity
    price changes related to certain deferred compensation
    obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in
    interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and
    fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to
    maintain its

variable-to-total

debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations,
    which accounted for approximately 27% of 2009 net sales,
    are concentrated principally in Australia, Canada, France and
    Germany. The company manages its foreign currency exposures by
    borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing
    cross-currency swaps and forward contracts. Swaps and forward
    contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related
    underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent
    of those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts
    for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders
    and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in
    connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain
    commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters
    into commodity futures and option contracts to reduce the
    volatility of price fluctuations of natural gas, diesel fuel,
    wheat, soybean oil, cocoa, aluminum and corn which impact the
    cost of raw materials.

The information below summarizes the company’s market risks
    associated with debt obligations and other significant financial
    instruments as of August 2, 2009. Fair values included
    herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or
    pricing models using current market rates. The information
    presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 11
    through 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



The table below presents principal cash flows and related
    interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations.
    Interest rates disclosed on variable-rate debt maturing in 2010
    represent the weighted-average rates at the period end. Notional
    amounts and related interest rates of interest rate swaps are
    presented by fiscal year of maturity. For the swaps, variable
    rates are the weighted-average forward rates for the term of
    each contract.

As of August 3, 2008, fixed-rate debt of approximately
    $1.9 billion with an average interest rate of 6.08% and
    variable-rate debt of approximately $679 million with an
    average interest rate of 2.38% were outstanding. As of
    August 3, 2008, the company had swapped $675 million
    of fixed-rate debt to variable. The average rate to be received
    on these swaps was 5.19% and the average rate paid was estimated
    to be 4.42% over the remaining life of the swaps. As of
    August 3, 2008, the company had two forward starting
    interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of
    $200 million to hedge an anticipated debt offering in
    fiscal 2009. The average rate estimated to be received on these
    swaps was 5.05% and the average rate to be paid was 4.90%.

The company is exposed to foreign exchange risk related to its
    international operations, including non-functional currency
    intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries. The
    following table summarizes the cross-currency swaps outstanding
    as of August 2, 2009, which hedge such exposures. The

The company had an additional $22 million in a number of
    smaller contracts to purchase or sell various other currencies,
    such as the Australian dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and Swedish
    krona, as of August 2, 2009. The aggregate fair value of
    all contracts was a loss of $10 million as of
    August 2, 2009. The total forward exchange contracts
    outstanding as of August 3, 2008 were $190 million
    with a fair value gain of $1 million.

The company enters into commodity futures and options contracts
    to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities.
    The notional value of these contracts was $51 million and
    the aggregate fair value of these contracts was not material as
    of August 2, 2009. The total notional value of these
    contracts was $146 million and the aggregate fair value was
    a loss of $3 million as of August 3, 2008.

The company had swap contracts outstanding as of August 2,
    2009, which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain
    deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of
    the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the total return
    of the company’s capital stock and the total return of the
    Puritan Fund. Under these contracts, the company pays variable
    interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Index total return, the
    Puritan Fund total return, or the total return on company
    capital stock. The notional value of the contract that is linked
    to the return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
    was $8 million at August 2, 2009 and $16 million
    at August 3, 2008. The average forward interest rate
    applicable to the contract, which expires in 2010, was 0.78% at
    August 2, 2009. The notional value of the contract that is
    linked to the return on the Puritan Fund was $6 million at
    August 2, 2009 and $9 million at August 3, 2008.
    The average forward interest rate applicable to the contract,
    which expires in 2010, was 1.48% at August 2, 2009. The
    notional value of the contract that is linked to the total
    return on company capital stock was $34 million at
    August 2, 2009 and $31 million at August 3, 2008.
    The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract,
    which expires in 2010, was 0.98% at August 2, 2009. The
    fair value of these contracts was a $4 million gain at
    August 2, 2009 and $1 million gain at August 3,
    2008.

The company’s utilization of financial instruments in
    managing market risk exposures described above is consistent
    with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial
    instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt
    repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign
    currency, and the company’s acquisition and divestiture
    activities.

Significant
    Accounting Estimates

The consolidated financial statements of the company are
    prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States. The preparation of these
    financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported
    amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates and
    assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies.
    The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex
    judgments, estimates and assumptions:

Trade and consumer promotion programs

— The
    company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and
    consumers, such as cooperative advertising programs, feature
    price discounts, in-store display incentives and coupons. The
    recognition of the costs for these programs, which are
    classified as a reduction of revenue, involves the use of
    judgment related to performance and redemption estimates.
    Estimates are made based on historical experience and other
    factors. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption
    rates and performance vary from estimates.

Valuation of long-lived assets

— Fixed assets
    and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as
    events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the
    carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted
    cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment
    exists. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is
    calculated based on estimated fair value.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at
    least annually for impairment, or as events or changes in
    circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the
    asset may not be recoverable.

Goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison of the
    fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value. Fair
    value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The
    discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant
    management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating
    margins, weighted



average cost of capital, and future economic and market
    conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds
    fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the
    impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the
    goodwill and the “implied” fair value, which is
    calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and
    accounted for as a business combination. As of August 2,
    2009, the carrying value of goodwill was $1.901 billion.
    The company has not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a
    result of annual testing, which began in 2003. As of the 2009
    measurement, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the
    carrying value by at least 30%. Holding all other assumptions
    used in the 2009 measurement constant, a 100-basis-point
    increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not
    result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in
    excess of the fair value.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by
    comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value.
    Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses
    that include significant management assumptions such as revenue
    growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of
    capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the carrying value
    exceeds the fair value, the asset is reduced to fair value. In
    2009, as part of the company’s annual review of intangible
    assets, an impairment charge of $67 million was recognized
    related to certain European trademarks, primarily in Germany and
    the Nordic region, used in the International Soup, Sauces and
    Beverages segment. The trademarks were determined to be impaired
    as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands,
    resulting from reduced expectations for discounted cash flows in
    comparison to prior year. The reduction was due in part to a
    deterioration in market conditions and an increase in the
    weighted average cost of capital. As of August 2, 2009, the
    carrying value of trademarks was $508 million. Holding all
    other assumptions  used in the 2009 measurement constant, the
    estimated impact of a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted
    average cost of capital would be a reduction in the carrying
    value of trademarks of approximately $10 million. See
    Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.

The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable
    management judgment and are based upon assumptions about
    expected future operating performance, economic conditions,
    market conditions, and cost of capital. Assumptions used in
    these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. However,
    inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties
    beyond the company’s control, such as capital markets. The
    actual cash flows could differ from management’s estimates
    due to changes in business conditions, operating performance,
    and economic conditions.

Pension and postretirement benefits

— The
    company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to
    employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with
    such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions,
    including discount rates, expected return on plan assets,
    compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend
    rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the
    required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that
    differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated
    and amortized over future periods.

The discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal
    year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate,
    the company reviews published market indices of high-quality
    debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In
    addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield
    curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The
    expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based
    upon historical experience and expected future performance,
    considering the company’s current and projected investment
    mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation,
    long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a
    premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period,
    significant differences may arise between the actual return and
    the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets,
    used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a
    calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between
    the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated
    method. Gains and losses resulting from differences between
    actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each
    measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the
    greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized
    into earnings in the following year.

Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was
    $53 million in 2009, $54 million in 2008 and
    $57 million in 2007. The 2008 expense included
    $2 million of special termination benefits and curtailment
    costs related to the Godiva divestiture, which was recorded in
    discontinued operations. The 2008 expense also included
    $4 million of



special termination and curtailment costs related to the
    restructuring initiatives. Significant weighted-average
    assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows:

Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are
    as follows: a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate
    would increase expense by approximately $13 million; a
    50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets
    assumption would increase expense by approximately
    $11 million. A one percentage point increase in assumed
    health care costs would increase postretirement service and
    interest cost by approximately $1 million.

Net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to
    increase to approximately $80 million in 2010 primarily due
    to a reduction in the discount rate for benefit obligations, a
    significant decline in the fair value of plan assets and a
    reduction in the expected return on plan assets.

Although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the
    U.S. plans in 2009, 2008 and 2007, the company made
    voluntary contributions of $70 million in 2008 and
    $22 million in 2007 to a U.S. plan based on expected
    future funding requirements. Contributions to international
    plans were $13 million in 2009, $8 million in 2008 and
    $10 million in 2007. Given the adverse impact of declining
    financial markets on the funding levels of the plans, the
    company contributed $260 million to a U.S. plan in the
    first quarter of 2010. Contributions to

non-U.S. plans

are expected to be approximately $18 million in 2010.

As of July 29, 2007, the company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).” SFAS No. 158
    requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined
    benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability on the
    balance sheet and requires any unrecognized prior service cost
    and actuarial gains/losses to be recognized in other
    comprehensive income.

See also Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information on pension and postretirement
    expenses.

Income taxes

—  The effective tax rate reflects
    statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the
    various jurisdictions in which the company operates and
    management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various
    tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in
    determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax
    positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable
    or payable in the current year and include the effect of
    deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the future impact of differences between the
    financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
    and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss
    and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences
    are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances
    are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely
    than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

Beginning in 2008, the tax reserves are established in
    accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    Interpretation No. (FIN) 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109,” which was adopted at the beginning of fiscal
    2008. Upon adoption, the company recognized a cumulative-effect
    adjustment of $6 million as an increase in the liability
    for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties,
    and a reduction in retained earnings. Prior to the adoption of
    FIN 48, tax reserves were established to reflect the
    probable outcome of known tax contingencies. As of
    August 2, 2009, the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits, including interest and penalties, was $50 million.



See also Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion on income taxes.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R)
    “Business Combinations,” which establishes the
    principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes the
    assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
    interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at
    their fair values as of that date with limited exceptions.
    SFAS No. 141(R) also requires acquisition-related
    transaction costs to be expensed as incurred rather than
    capitalized as a component of the business combination. In April
    2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 141(R)-1 “Accounting for
    Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business
    Combination That Arise from Contingencies.”
    SFAS No. 141(R) and FSP FAS 141(R)-1 apply to
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is after
    the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning
    after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted.
    The company will adopt SFAS 141(R) as revised for any
    business combinations entered into in fiscal 2010 and thereafter.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an Amendment of ARB No. 51.”
    SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting
    standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and
    for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be recorded as equity in
    the consolidated financial statements. This Statement also
    requires that consolidated net income shall be adjusted to
    include the net income attributed to the noncontrolling
    interest. Disclosure on the face of the income statement of the
    amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent
    and to the noncontrolling interest is required.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted.
    The company will adopt SFAS No. 160 in first quarter
    of fiscal 2010. The company does not expect the adoption will
    have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force
    (EITF)

03-6-1

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” FSP

EITF 03-6-1

provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
    non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
    (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall
    be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to
    the two-class method. FSP

EITF 03-6-1

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and interim periods within those years. Upon adoption, a
    company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per
    share data (including any amounts related to interim periods,
    summaries of earnings and selected financial data) to conform
    with the provisions of FSP

EITF 03-6-1.

The company will adopt FSP

EITF 03-6-1

in fiscal 2010 and all prior period earnings per share data will
    be restated. Upon adoption, the company expects the following
    reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal
    2009 and fiscal 2008:

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit
    Plan Assets,” which provides additional guidance on
    employers’ disclosures about the plan assets of defined
    benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The disclosures
    required by FSP FAS 132(R)-1 include a description of how
    investment allocation decisions are made, major categories of
    plan assets, valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
    of plan assets, the impact of measurements using significant
    unobservable inputs and concentrations of risk within plan
    assets. The disclosures about plan assets required by this FSP
    shall be provided for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2009. FSP FAS 132(R)-1 will be effective
    for the company for fiscal year end 2010 and will result in
    additional disclosures.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

FAS No. 107-1

and Accounting Principles Board (APB)

28-1

“Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments,” which requires disclosures about fair value
    of financial instruments for interim reporting periods and
    amends APB Opinion No. 28 “Interim Financial
    Reporting” to require those disclosures in summarized
    financial information at interim reporting periods. The FSP is
    effective for interim reporting periods ending after
    June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods
    ending after March 15, 2009.



The FSP does not require disclosures for earlier periods
    presented for comparative purposes at initial adoption. The
    company will adopt the disclosure requirements in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010.

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168 “The
    FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification

tm

and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles — a Replacement of FASB Statement
    No. 162.” The FASB Accounting Standards Codification
    (Codification) will become the source of authoritative
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be
    applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive
    releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under
    authority of federal securities laws are also sources of
    authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. On the effective date of
    this Statement, the Codification will supersede all
    then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All
    other nongrandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not
    included in the Codification will become nonauthoritative. This
    Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009.
    The adoption of SFAS No. 168 is not expected to have a
    material impact on the company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Cautionary
    Factors That May Affect Future Results

This Report contains “forward-looking” statements that
    reflect the company’s current expectations regarding future
    results of operations, economic performance, financial condition
    and achievements of the company. The company tries, wherever
    possible, to identify these forward-looking statements by using
    words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “estimate,” “expect,” “will” and
    similar expressions. One can also identify them by the fact that
    they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
    These statements reflect the company’s current plans and
    expectations and are based on information currently available to
    it. They rely on a number of assumptions regarding future events
    and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are inherently
    subject to risks and uncertainties.

The company wishes to caution the reader that the following
    important factors and those important factors described in
    Part 1, Item 1A and elsewhere in the commentary, or in
    the Securities and Exchange Commission filings of the company,
    could affect the company’s actual results and could cause
    such results to vary materially from those expressed in any
    forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company:

•

the impact of strong competitive response to the company’s
    efforts to leverage its brand power with product innovation,
    promotional programs and new advertising, and of changes in
    consumer demand for the company’s products;

•

the risks in the marketplace associated with trade and consumer
    acceptance of product improvements, shelving initiatives and new
    product introductions;

•

the company’s ability to achieve sales and earnings
    guidance, which are based on assumptions about sales volume,
    product mix, the development and success of new products, the
    impact of marketing and pricing actions and product costs;

•

the company’s ability to realize projected cost savings and
    benefits, including those contemplated by restructuring programs
    and other cost-savings initiatives;

•

the company’s ability to successfully manage changes to its
    business processes, including selling, distribution, product
    capacity, information management systems and the integration of
    acquisitions;

•

the increased significance of certain of the company’s key
    trade customers;

•

the impact of inventory management practices by the
    company’s trade customers;

•

the impact of fluctuations in the supply and inflation in
    energy, raw and packaging materials cost;

•

the risks associated with portfolio changes and completion of
    acquisitions and divestitures;

•

the uncertainties of litigation described from time to time in
    the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings;

•

the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, tax rates,
    interest rates, debt and equity markets, inflation rates,
    economic conditions and other external factors; and



•

the impact of unforeseen business disruptions in one or more of
    the company’s markets due to political instability, civil
    disobedience, armed hostilities, natural disasters or other
    calamities.

This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but
    is designed to highlight important factors that may impact the
    company’s outlook. The company disclaims any obligation or
    intent to update forward-looking statements made by the company
    in order to reflect new information, events or circumstances
    after the date they are made.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(currency in millions, except per share amounts)

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

— The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of the company and its
    majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are
    eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior-year
    financial statements were reclassified to conform to the
    current-year presentation. The company’s fiscal year ends
    on the Sunday nearest July 31. There were 52 weeks in
    2009 and 2007 and 53 weeks in 2008.

On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its
    Godiva Chocolatier business for $850, pursuant to a Sale and
    Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The company has
    reflected the results of this business as discontinued
    operations in the consolidated statements of earnings. See
    Note 3 for additional information on the sale.

On August 15, 2006, the company completed the sale of its
    United Kingdom and Ireland businesses for £460, or
    approximately $870, pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement
    dated July 12, 2006. The company has reflected the results
    of these businesses as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of earnings. See Note 3 for
    additional information on the sale.

Subsequent events have been evaluated through September 30,
    2009, which represents the date the Consolidated Financial
    Statements were issued.

Revenue Recognition

— Revenues are recognized
    when the earnings process is complete. This occurs when products
    are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements, title and
    risk of loss transfer to customers, collection is probable and
    pricing is fixed or determinable. Revenues are recognized net of
    provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Certain sales
    promotion expenses, such as coupon redemption costs, cooperative
    advertising programs, new product introduction fees, feature
    price discounts and in-store display incentives, are classified
    as a reduction of sales.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— All highly liquid
    debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or
    less are classified as cash equivalents.

Inventories

— All inventories are valued at the
    lower of average cost or market.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant
    and equipment are recorded at historical cost and are
    depreciated over estimated useful lives using the straight-line
    method. Buildings and machinery and equipment are depreciated
    over periods not exceeding 45 years and 15 years,
    respectively. Assets are evaluated for impairment when
    conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Such conditions include significant adverse changes
    in business climate or a plan of disposal.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

— Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather
    are tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for
    impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur
    indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
    Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the
    estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment in accordance
    with SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment
    or Disposal of Long-lived Assets.” Goodwill impairment
    testing first requires a comparison of the fair value of each
    reporting unit to the carrying value. If the carrying value of
    the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered
    impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between
    the carrying value of goodwill and the “implied” fair
    value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just
    been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.
    Impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets
    requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying value
    of the asset. If carrying value exceeds the fair value, the
    asset is reduced to fair value. Fair values are primarily
    determined using discounted cash flow analyses. See Note 5
    for information on goodwill and other intangible assets.

Derivative Financial Instruments

— The company
    uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of
    hedging exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates, interest rates, commodities and equity-linked employee
    benefit obligations. These derivative contracts are entered into
    for periods consistent with



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions
    independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into
    derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use
    leveraged instruments. The company’s derivative programs
    include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for
    hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” as amended.

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair
    value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the
    company designates the derivative as a hedge of the fair value
    of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment
    (fair-value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of
    the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to
    a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge), or a hedge of
    a net investment in a foreign operation. Some derivatives may
    also be considered natural hedging instruments (changes in fair
    value act as economic offsets to changes in fair value of the
    underlying hedged item) and are not designated for hedge
    accounting under SFAS No. 133.

Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the
    gain or loss on the underlying hedged asset or liability
    (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in
    current-period earnings. The effective portion of gains and
    losses on cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive
    income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of
    cash flows. If a derivative is used as a hedge of a net
    investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair value, to
    the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in other
    comprehensive income (loss). Any ineffective portion of
    designated hedges is recognized in current-period earnings.
    Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated
    for hedge accounting are recognized in current-period earnings.

Cash flows from derivative contracts are included in Net cash
    provided by operating activities.

Stock-Based Compensation

— On August 1,
    2005, the company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004) “Share-Based Payment”
    (SFAS No. 123R), which requires stock-based
    compensation to be measured based on the grant-date fair value
    of the awards and the cost to be recognized over the period
    during which an employee is required to provide service in
    exchange for the award. The company provides compensation
    benefits by issuing unrestricted stock, restricted stock and
    restricted stock units (including EPS performance restricted
    stock/units and total shareowner return (TSR) performance
    restricted stock/units). In previous fiscal years, the company
    also issued stock options and stock appreciation rights to
    provide compensation benefits. SFAS No. 123R was
    adopted using the modified prospective transition method. Under
    this method, the provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to
    all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. In
    addition, compensation expense was recognized for any unvested
    stock option awards outstanding as of the date of adoption. See
    also Note 14.

Use of Estimates

— Generally accepted
    accounting principles require management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect assets and liabilities, contingent
    assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Income Taxes

— Income taxes are accounted for
    in accordance with SFAS No. 109 “Accounting for
    Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the future impact of differences between the
    financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
    and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss
    and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
    on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
    is recognized in income in the period that includes the
    enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce
    deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax
    benefit will not be realized.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Interpretation No. 48
    (FIN 48) “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109.” FIN 48 clarifies the criteria that must
    be met for financial statement recognition and measurement of
    tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
    This Interpretation also addresses derecognition, recognition of
    related penalties and interest, classification of liabilities
    and disclosures of unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 was
    effective



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The
    company adopted FIN 48 as of July 30, 2007 (the
    beginning of fiscal 2008). See Note 10 for additional
    information.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

Recently
    Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157
    “Fair Value Measurements,” which provides guidance for
    using fair value to measure assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 157 establishes a definition of fair value,
    provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands the
    disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. This
    statement does not require any new fair value measurements but
    rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that
    require or permit fair value measurements. In February 2008,
    FASB Staff Position (FSP) No.

FAS 157-2

was issued, which delayed by a year the effective date for
    certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The company adopted
    SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and liabilities in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 13 for
    additional information. The adoption did not have a material
    impact on the consolidated financial statements. The company is
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 as it
    relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The company will
    adopt the remaining provisions in fiscal 2010 but does not
    expect the adoption to have a material impact on the
    consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” SFAS No. 159 allows companies to
    choose, at specific election dates, to measure eligible
    financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not
    otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company
    elects the fair value option for an eligible item, changes in
    that item’s fair value in subsequent reporting periods must
    be recognized in current earnings. The company adopted
    SFAS No. 159 at the beginning of fiscal 2009. The
    company elected not to adopt the fair value option under
    SFAS No. 159 for eligible financial assets and
    liabilities.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133,” which enhances the disclosure requirements
    for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are
    required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) the
    location and amounts of derivative instruments in an
    entity’s financial statements, (b) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under
    Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
    entity’s financial position, financial performance, and
    cash flows. The guidance in SFAS No. 161 is effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim
    periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early
    application encouraged. This Statement encouraged, but did not
    require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial
    adoption. The company adopted SFAS No. 161 in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 12 for additional
    information.

In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165
    “Subsequent Events,” which establishes general
    standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur
    after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements
    are issued or are available to be issued. The Statement sets
    forth the period after the balance sheet date during which
    management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur
    for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial
    statements, the circumstances under which an entity should
    recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance
    sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that
    an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred
    after the balance sheet date. It requires the disclosure of the
    date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events.
    SFAS No. 165 is effective for interim and annual
    reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, and shall be
    applied prospectively. The company adopted
    SFAS No. 165 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. See
    Note 1 under Basis of Presentation for disclosures required
    under SFAS No. 165.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R)
    “Business Combinations,” which establishes the
    principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes the
    assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
    interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at
    their fair values as of that date with



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

limited exceptions. SFAS No. 141(R) also requires
    acquisition-related transaction costs to be expensed as incurred
    rather than capitalized as a component of the business
    combination. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP
    FAS 141(R)-1 “Accounting for Assets Acquired and
    Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from
    Contingencies.” SFAS No. 141(R) and FSP
    FAS 141(R)-1 apply to business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is after the beginning of the first annual
    reporting period beginning after December 15, 2008. Earlier
    adoption is not permitted. The company will adopt
    SFAS No. 141(R) as revised for any business
    combinations entered into in fiscal 2010 and thereafter.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an Amendment of ARB No. 51.”
    SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting
    standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and
    for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be recorded as equity in
    the consolidated financial statements. This Statement also
    requires that consolidated net income shall be adjusted to
    include the net income attributed to the noncontrolling
    interest. Disclosure on the face of the income statement of the
    amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent
    and to the noncontrolling interest is required.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted.
    The company will adopt SFAS No. 160 in first quarter
    of fiscal 2010. The company does not expect the adoption will
    have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force
    (EITF)

03-6-1

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” FSP

EITF 03-6-1

provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
    non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
    (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall
    be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to
    the two-class method. FSP

EITF 03-6-1

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and interim periods within those years. Upon adoption, a
    company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per
    share data (including any amounts related to interim periods,
    summaries of earnings and selected financial data) to conform
    with the provisions of FSP

EITF 03-6-1.

The company will adopt FSP

EITF 03-6-1

in fiscal 2010 and all prior period earnings per share data will
    be restated. Upon adoption, the company expects the following
    reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal
    2009 and fiscal 2008:

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit
    Plan Assets,” which provides additional guidance on
    employers’ disclosures about the plan assets of defined
    benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The disclosures
    required by FSP FAS 132(R)-1 include a description of how
    investment allocation decisions are made, major categories of
    plan assets, valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
    of plan assets, the impact of measurements using significant
    unobservable inputs and concentrations of risk within plan
    assets. The disclosures about plan assets required by this FSP
    shall be provided for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2009. FSP FAS 132(R)-1 will be effective
    for the company for fiscal year end 2010 and will result in
    additional disclosures.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

FAS No. 107-1

and Accounting Principles Board (APB)

28-1

“Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments,” which requires disclosures about fair value
    of financial instruments for interim reporting periods and
    amends APB Opinion No. 28 “Interim Financial
    Reporting” to require those disclosures in summarized
    financial information at interim reporting periods. The FSP is
    effective for interim reporting periods ending after
    June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods
    ending after March 15, 2009. The FSP does not require
    disclosures for earlier periods presented for comparative
    purposes at initial adoption. The company will adopt the
    disclosure requirements in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168 “The
    FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification

tm

and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles — a Replacement of FASB Statement
    No. 162.” The



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) will
    become the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles (GAAP) to be applied by nongovernmental
    entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities
    laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.
    On the effective date of this Statement, the Codification will
    supersede all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting
    standards. All other nongrandfathered non-SEC accounting
    literature not included in the Codification will become
    nonauthoritative. This Statement is effective for financial
    statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after
    September 15, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 168
    is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Divestitures

Discontinued
    Operations

On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its
    Godiva Chocolatier business for $850. The purchase price was
    subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in
    an additional $20 of proceeds. The company has reflected the
    results of this business as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of earnings. The company used
    approximately $600 of the net proceeds to purchase company
    stock. The 2008 results included a $462 after-tax gain, or $1.21
    per share, on the Godiva Chocolatier sale. The company
    recognized a $4 benefit in 2009 as a result of adjustment to the
    tax liability associated with the sale.

On August 15, 2006, the company completed the sale of its
    businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland for £460, or
    approximately $870, pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement
    dated July 12, 2006. The United Kingdom and Ireland
    businesses included

Homepride

sauces,

OXO

stock
    cubes,

Batchelors

soups and

McDonnells

and

Erin

soups. The Sale and Purchase Agreement provides for working
    capital and other post-closing adjustments. Additional proceeds
    of $19 were received from the finalization of the post-closing
    adjustment. The company has reflected the results of these
    businesses as discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of earnings. The 2007 results included a $24
    after-tax gain, or $.06 per share, on the United Kingdom and
    Ireland sale. The 2007 results also included a $7 tax benefit
    from the favorable resolution of tax audits in the United
    Kingdom. The company used approximately $620 of the net proceeds
    from the sale of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to
    repurchase shares. Upon completion of the sale, the company paid
    $83 to settle cross-currency swap contracts and foreign exchange
    forward contracts which hedged exposures related to the
    businesses. The remaining net proceeds were used to pay taxes
    and expenses associated with the business and to repay debt.

charges on the Statements of Earnings in 2008. See also
    Note 7. The terms of the agreement required the company to
    provide a loan facility to the buyer of AUD $10, or
    approximately USD $7. The facility was drawn down in AUD $5
    increments in 2009. Borrowings under the facility are to be
    repaid five years after the closing date.

In July 2008, the company entered into an agreement to sell its
    sauce and mayonnaise business comprised of products sold under
    the

Lesieur

brand in France. The company recorded a
    pre-tax impairment charge of $2 to adjust the net assets to
    estimated realizable value in 2008. The sale was completed on
    September 29, 2008 and resulted in $36 of proceeds. The
    purchase price was subject to working capital and other
    post-closing adjustments, which resulted in an additional $6 of
    proceeds. The business was historically included in the
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment and had annual
    net sales of approximately $70. The assets and liabilities of
    this business were reflected as assets and liabilities held for
    sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of August 3, 2008
    and are comprised of the following:

Comprehensive
    Income

Total comprehensive income is comprised of net earnings, net
    foreign currency translation adjustments, pension and
    postretirement benefit adjustments (see Note 9), and net
    unrealized gains and losses on cash-flow hedges (see
    Note 12). Accumulated other comprehensive loss at
    July 29, 2007 also includes the impact of adoption of
    SFAS No. 158 (See Note 9). Total comprehensive
    income for the twelve months ended August 2, 2009,
    August 3, 2008 and July 29, 2007 was $154, $1,152 and
    $957, respectively.

    products through various food service channels in the United
    States and Canada. In fiscal 2008, the Godiva Chocolatier
    business was sold. See Note 3 for additional information on
    the sale. Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the

In July 2008, the company entered into an agreement to sell its
    sauce and mayonnaise business comprised of products sold under
    the

Lesieur

brand in France. The company recorded a
    pre-tax impairment charge of $2 to adjust the net assets to
    estimated net realizable value. The assets and liabilities of
    this business were reflected as assets and liabilities held for
    sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of August 3,
    2008. The sale was completed on September 29, 2008.

The following table sets forth balance sheet information for
    intangible assets, excluding goodwill, subject to amortization

Non-amortizable

intangible assets consist of trademarks. Amortizable intangible
    assets consist substantially of process technology and customer

Amortization was less than $1 in 2009, 2008 and 2007. The
    estimated aggregated amortization expense for each of the five
    succeeding fiscal years is less than $1 per year. Asset useful
    lives range from ten to twenty years.

In 2009, as part of the company’s annual review of
    intangible assets, an impairment charge of $67 was recognized
    related to certain European trademarks, primarily in Germany and
    the Nordic region, used in the International Soup, Sauces and
    Beverages segment. The trademarks were determined to be impaired
    as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands,
    resulting from reduced expectations for discounted cash flows in
    comparison to prior year. The reduction was due in part to a
    deterioration in market conditions and an increase in the
    weighted average cost of capital.

In May 2009, the company acquired Ecce Panis, Inc. Intangible
    assets from the acquisition totaled $16. See Note 8 for
    additional information.

In 2008, the company recognized an impairment charge of $4
    related to the performance of certain trademarks used in the
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment.

Restructuring
    Charges

On April 28, 2008, the company announced a series of
    initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term
    profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands
    and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities
    in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the company’s
    management structure. As a result of these initiatives, in 2008,
    the company recorded a restructuring charge of $175 ($102 after
    tax or $.27 per share). The charge consisted of a net loss of
    $120 ($64 after tax) on the sale of certain Australian salty
    snack food brands and assets, $45 ($31 after tax) of employee
    severance and benefit costs, including the estimated impact of
    curtailment and other pension charges, and $10 ($7 after tax) of
    property, plant and equipment impairment charges. In addition,
    approximately $7 ($5 after tax or $.01 per share) of costs
    related to these initiatives were recorded in Cost of products
    sold, primarily representing accelerated depreciation on
    property, plant and equipment. The aggregate after-tax impact of
    restructuring charges and related costs in 2008 was $107, or
    $.28 per share. In 2009, the company recorded approximately $22
    ($15 after tax or $.04 per share) of costs related to these
    initiatives in Cost of products sold. Approximately $17 of the
    costs represented accelerated depreciation on property, plant
    and equipment, approximately $4 related to other exit costs and
    approximately $1 related to employee severance and benefit
    costs, including other pension charges. The company expects to
    incur additional pre-tax costs of approximately $12 in benefit
    costs related to pension charges. Of the aggregate $216 of
    pre-tax costs for the total program, the company expects
    approximately $40 will be cash expenditures, the majority of
    which was spent in 2009.

Primarily due to foreign currency translation.

In the third quarter of 2008, as part of the previously
    discussed initiatives, the company entered into an agreement to
    sell certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets. The
    transaction was completed on May 12, 2008. Proceeds of the
    sale were nominal. See also Note 3.

In April 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives,
    the company announced plans to close the Listowel, Ontario,
    Canada food plant. The Listowel facility produced primarily
    frozen products, including soup, entrees, and Pepperidge Farm
    products, as well as ramen noodles. The facility employed
    approximately 500 people. The company closed the facility
    in April 2009. Production was transitioned to its network of
    North American contract manufacturers and to its Downingtown,
    Pennsylvania plant. The company recorded $20 ($14 after tax) of
    employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated
    impact of curtailment and other pension charges, and $7 ($5
    after tax) in accelerated depreciation of property, plant and
    equipment in 2008. In 2009, the company recorded $1 of employee
    severance and benefit costs, including other pension charges,
    $16 ($11 after tax) in accelerated depreciation of property,
    plant and equipment and $2 ($1 after tax) of other exit costs.
    The company expects to incur approximately $12 in benefit costs
    related to pension charges.

In April 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives,
    the company also announced plans to discontinue the private
    label biscuit and industrial chocolate production at its
    Miranda, Australia facility. The company closed the Miranda
    facility, which employed approximately 150 people, in the
    second quarter of 2009. In connection with this action, the
    company recorded $10 ($7 after tax) of property, plant and
    equipment impairment charges and $8 ($6 after tax) in employee
    severance and benefit costs in 2008. In 2009, the company
    recorded $1 in accelerated depreciation of property, plant, and
    equipment, and $2 ($1 after tax) in other exit costs.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As part of the previously discussed initiatives, the company
    streamlined its management structure and eliminated certain
    overhead costs. These actions began in the fourth quarter of
    2008 and were substantially completed in 2009. In connection
    with this action, the company recorded $17 ($11 after tax) in
    employee severance and benefit costs in 2008.

Acquisitions

On May 4, 2009, the company completed the acquisition of
    Ecce Panis, Inc., an artisan bread maker, for $66. The
    acquisition of Ecce Panis, Inc. is consistent with the
    company’s strategy to drive growth in its core categories.
    The results of operations of Ecce Panis, Inc. are included in
    the Baking and Snacking segment and were not material to 2009
    results. The pro forma impact on sales, net earnings or earnings
    per share for the prior periods would not have been material. As
    part of the initial purchase price allocation, $46 was allocated
    to intangible assets primarily consisting of goodwill, trade
    secret process technology, trademarks and customer relationships.

brand on soup, stock, and broth
    products in North America retail locations.

Wolfgang Puck

is one of the leading organic soup brands in the United
    States. This business is included in the U.S. Soup, Sauces

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

— Substantially all of the
    company’s U.S. and certain

non-U.S. employees

are covered by noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. In
    1999, the company implemented significant amendments to certain
    U.S. plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are
    determined based on percentages of annual pay and age. To
    minimize the impact of converting to the new formula, service
    and earnings credit continues to accrue for active employees
    participating in the plans under the formula prior to the
    amendments through the year 2014. Employees will receive the
    benefit from either the new or old formula, whichever is higher.
    Benefits become vested upon the completion of three years of
    service. Benefits are paid from funds previously provided to
    trustees and insurance companies or are paid directly by the
    company from general funds. Plan assets consist primarily of
    investments in equities, fixed income securities, alternative
    investments and real estate.

Postretirement Benefits

— The company provides
    postretirement benefits including health care and life insurance
    to substantially all retired U.S. employees and their
    dependents. In 1999, changes were made to the postretirement
    benefits offered to certain U.S. employees. Participants
    who were not receiving postretirement benefits as of May 1,
    1999 will no longer be eligible to receive such benefits in the
    future, but the company will provide access to health care
    coverage for non-eligible future retirees on a group basis.
    Costs will be paid by the participants. To preserve the economic
    benefits for employees near retirement as of May 1, 1999,
    participants who were at least age 55 and had at least
    10 years of continuous service remain eligible for
    postretirement benefits.

In 2005, the company established retiree medical account
    benefits for eligible U.S. retirees, intended to provide
    reimbursement for eligible health care expenses.

On July 29, 2007, the company adopted
    SFAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
    132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to
    recognize the funded status of defined postretirement benefit
    plans as an asset or liability on



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the balance sheet and requires any unrecognized prior service
    cost and actuarial gains/losses to be recognized in other
    comprehensive income. SFAS No. 158 does not affect the
    company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows.
    As a result of the adoption in 2007, total assets were reduced
    by $294, shareowners’ equity was reduced by $230, and total
    liabilities were reduced by $64.

The company uses the fiscal year end as the measurement date for
    the benefit plans.

The expected rate of return on assets for the company’s
    global plans is a weighted average of the expected rates of
    return selected for the various countries where the company has
    funded pension plans. These rates of return are set annually and
    are based upon an estimate of future long-term investment
    returns for the projected asset allocation.

The discount rate used to determine net periodic postretirement
    expense was 7.00% in 2009, 6.50% in 2008 and 6.25% in 2007.

The fundamental goal underlying the pension plans’
    investment policy is to ensure that the assets of the plans are
    invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the
    plans as these obligations come due. Investment practices must
    comply with applicable laws and regulations.

The company’s investment strategy has been based on an
    expectation that equity securities will outperform debt
    securities over the long term. Accordingly, in order to maximize
    the return on assets, a majority of assets are invested in
    equities. Additional asset classes with dissimilar expected
    rates of return, return volatility, and correlations of returns
    are utilized to reduce risk by providing diversification
    relative to equities. Investments within each asset class are
    also diversified to further reduce the impact of losses in
    single investments. The use of derivative instruments is
    permitted where appropriate and necessary to achieve overall
    investment policy objectives and asset class targets.

The company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage
    targets and appropriate benchmarks for each significant asset
    class to obtain a prudent balance between return and risk. The
    interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is
    periodically studied to assist in the establishment of strategic
    asset allocation targets.

The company made voluntary contributions of $70 to a
    U.S. pension plan during the fiscal year ended
    August 3, 2008. Given the adverse impact of declining
    financial markets on the funding levels of the plans, the
    company contributed $260 to a U.S. plan in the first
    quarter of 2010. Contributions to

non-U.S. plans

are expected to be approximately $18 in 2010.

Savings Plan

— The company sponsors employee
    savings plans which cover substantially all U.S. employees.
    The company provides a matching contribution of 60% (50% at
    certain locations) of the employee contributions up to 5% of
    compensation after one year of continued service. Amounts
    charged to Costs and expenses were $18 in both 2009 and 2008 and
    $17 in 2007.

In the first quarter of 2009, the company recorded a tax benefit
    of $11 following the finalization of tax audits.

In the second quarter of 2008, the company recorded a tax
    benefit of $13 resulting from the resolution of a state tax
    contingency.

In the third quarter of 2007, the company recorded a tax benefit
    of $22 resulting from the settlement of bilateral advance
    pricing agreements (APA) among the company, the United States,
    and Canada related to royalties. In addition, the company
    reduced net interest expense by $4 ($3 after tax). The aggregate
    impact on Earnings from continuing operations was $25, or $.06
    per share. In 2007, the company also recognized an additional
    tax benefit of $40 following the finalization of the

2002-2004

At August 2, 2009, U.S. and

non-U.S. subsidiaries

of the company have tax loss carryforwards of approximately
    $288. Of these carryforwards, $115 expire between 2010 and 2028
    and $173 may be carried forward indefinitely. The current
    statutory tax rates in these countries range from 20% to 35%. At
    August 2, 2009, valuation allowances have been established
    to offset $63 of these tax loss carryforwards. Additionally, at
    August 2, 2009,

non-U.S. subsidiaries

of the company have capital loss carryforwards of approximately
    $311, which are fully offset by valuation allowances.

The company has undistributed earnings of

non-U.S. subsidiaries

of approximately $515. U.S. income taxes have not been
    provided on undistributed earnings, which are deemed to be
    permanently reinvested. It is not practical to estimate the tax
    liability that might be incurred if such earnings were remitted
    to the U.S.

The company adopted the provisions of FIN 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” as of
    July 30, 2007 (the beginning of fiscal 2008). Upon
    adoption, the company recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment
    of $6 as an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits, including interest and penalties, and a corresponding
    reduction in retained earnings. A reconciliation of the activity
    related to unrecognized tax benefits follows:

The balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of August 2,
    2009 was $42, of which $28 would impact the effective tax rate
    if recognized in future periods. The total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements,
    tax examination activities, statute expirations and the
    recognition and measurement criteria under FIN 48. The
    company is unable to estimate what this change could be within
    the next twelve months, but does not believe it would be
    material to the financial statements.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The company’s accounting policy with respect to interest
    and penalties attributable to income taxes is to reflect any
    expense or benefit as a component of its income tax provision.
    The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the
    Statements of Earnings in 2009 and 2008, respectively, was a
    benefit of $1 and $4. The total amount of interest and penalties
    recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    August 2, 2009 and August 3, 2008 was $8 and $7,
    respectively.

None of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, including
    interest and penalties, are expected to be settled within the
    next twelve months. The $50 of unrecognized tax benefit
    liabilities, including interest and penalties, are reported as
    other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
    as of August 2, 2009. Of the $61 of unrecognized tax
    benefit liabilities, including interest and penalties as of
    August 3, 2008, $2 were recorded in accrued income tax and
    $59 were reported as non-current liabilities on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.

The company does business globally and, as a result, files
    income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and
    various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of
    business, the company is subject to examination by taxing
    authorities throughout the world, including such major
    jurisdictions as the United States, Australia, Canada, Belgium,
    France and Germany. The tax years 2007 to 2009 are currently
    under audit by the IRS. In addition, several state income tax
    examinations are in progress for fiscal years 2001 to 2007.

In Australia, the company has been subject to a limited scope
    audit by the Australian tax office for fiscal years through
    2002. The statue of limitation is open for fiscal years 2003
    forward. With limited exceptions, the company is no longer
    subject to income tax audits in Canada for fiscal years before
    2005. The company is no longer subject to income tax audits for
    fiscal years 2005 and prior for Belgium and France, and for
    fiscal years 2007 and prior for Germany.

In July 2009, the company issued $300 of 3.375% notes which
    mature on August 15, 2014. Interest on the notes is due
    semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing on
    February 15, 2010. The company may redeem the notes in
    whole or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of
    the principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed
    to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early
    redemption.

In January 2009, the company issued $300 of 4.50% notes
    which mature on February 15, 2019. Interest on the notes is
    due semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing
    on August 15, 2009. The company may redeem the notes in
    whole or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of
    the principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed
    to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early
    redemption.

The fair value of the company’s long-term debt, including
    the current portion of long-term debt in Notes payable, was
    $2,437 at August 2, 2009 and $2,051 at August 3, 2008.

In November 2008, the company filed a registration statement
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an
    indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration
    statement, the company may issue debt securities, depending on
    market conditions.

Principal amounts of debt mature as follows: 2010-$378 (in
    current liabilities); 2011-$701; 2012-$2; 2013-$400; 2014-$300
    and beyond-$800.

Financial
    Instruments

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate
    fair value. The fair value of long-term debt as indicated in
    Note 11 is based on quoted market prices or pricing models
    using current market rates.

The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and
    commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity
    price changes related to certain deferred compensation
    obligations. In order to manage these exposures, the company
    follows established risk management policies and procedures,
    including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps,
    forwards and commodity futures and option contracts. These
    derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent
    with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute
    positions independent of those exposures. The company does not
    enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and
    does not use leveraged instruments. The company’s
    derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do
    not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No.
    133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities.”



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to
    derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual
    obligations. The company minimizes the counterparty credit risk
    on these transactions by dealing only with leading,
    credit-worthy financial institutions having long-term credit
    ratings of “A” or better and, therefore, does not
    anticipate nonperformance. In addition, the contracts are
    distributed among several financial institutions, thus
    minimizing credit risk concentration. The company does not have
    credit-risk-related contingent features in its derivative
    instruments as of August 2, 2009.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Risk

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related
    to its international operations, including non-functional
    currency intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries.
    The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result
    of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency
    of certain subsidiaries. The company utilizes foreign exchange
    forward purchase and sale contracts as well as cross-currency
    swaps to hedge these exposures. The contracts are either
    designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated.
    The company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign
    currency transaction exposure with foreign exchange forward
    contracts for up to eighteen months. To hedge currency exposures
    related to intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts are
    entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt. As
    of August 2, 2009, cross-currency swap contracts mature in
    2010 through 2014. Principal currencies hedged include the
    Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Swedish krona, New
    Zealand dollar, British pound and Japanese yen. The notional
    amount of foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap
    contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges was $322 and $307 at
    August 2, 2009 and August 3, 2008, respectively. The
    effective portion of the changes in fair value on these
    instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and
    is reclassified into the Statements of Earnings on the same line
    item and same period in which the underlying hedge transaction
    affects earnings. The notional amount of foreign exchange
    forward and cross-currency swap contracts that are not
    designated as accounting hedges was $802 and $582 at
    August 2, 2009 and August 3, 2008, respectively.

Interest
    Rate Risk

The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by
    optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by
    utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its

variable-to-total

debt ratio within targeted guidelines. Receive fixed rate/pay
    variable rate interest rate swaps are accounted for as
    fair-value hedges. The notional amount of outstanding fair-value
    interest rate swaps at August 2, 2009 and August 3,
    2008, totaled $500 and $675, respectively.

In June 2008, the company entered into two forward starting
    interest rate swap contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges
    with a combined notional value of $200 to hedge an anticipated
    debt offering in fiscal 2009. These swaps were settled as of
    November 2, 2008, at a loss of $13, which was recorded in
    other comprehensive income (loss). In January 2009, the company
    issued $300 ten-year 4.50% notes. The loss on the swap
    contracts will be amortized over the life of the debt as
    additional interest expense.

Commodity
    Price Risk

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders
    and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in
    connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain
    commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters
    into commodity futures and options contracts to reduce the
    volatility of price fluctuations of natural gas, diesel fuel,
    wheat, soybean oil, cocoa, aluminum and corn which impact the
    cost of raw materials. Commodity futures and option contracts
    are typically accounted for as cash-flow hedges or are not
    designated as accounting hedges. Commodity futures and option
    contracts are typically entered into to hedge a portion of
    commodity requirements for periods up to 18 months. The
    notional amount of commodity contracts accounted for as
    cash-flow hedges was $7 and $66 at August 2, 2009 and
    August 3, 2008, respectively. The notional amount of
    commodity contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges
    was $44 and $80 at August 2, 2009 and August 3, 2008,
    respectively. As of August 2, 2009, the contracts mature
    within 12 months.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Equity
    Price Risk

The company hedges a portion of exposures relating to certain
    deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of
    the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the total return
    of the company’s capital stock and the total return of the
    Puritan Fund. Under these contracts, the company pays variable
    interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the
    total return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
    the total return of the Puritan Fund, or the total return on
    company capital stock. These instruments are not designated as
    hedges for accounting purposes. The contracts are typically
    entered into for periods not exceeding 12 months. The
    notional amount of the company’s deferred compensation
    hedges as of August 3, 2009 and August 3, 2008 were
    $48 and $56, respectively.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value
    Measurements” for financial assets and liabilities, as
    described in Note 2. The provisions have been applied
    prospectively beginning August 4, 2008. Under
    SFAS No. 157, the company is required to categorize
    financial assets and liabilities based on the following fair
    value hierarchy:

•

Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices
    (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active
    markets.

•

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in
    Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
    through corroboration with observable market data.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the
    reporting entity’s own assumptions.

The following table presents the company’s financial assets
    and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring
    basis at August 2, 2009 consistent with the fair value
    hierarchy of SFAS No. 157:

Shareowners’
    Equity

The company has authorized 560 million shares of Capital
    stock with $.0375 par value and 40 million shares of
    Preferred stock, issuable in one or more classes, with or
    without par as may be authorized by the Board of Directors. No
    Preferred stock has been issued.

Share
    Repurchase Programs

In November 2005, the company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the purchase of up to $600 of company stock through
    fiscal 2008. This program was completed during the third quarter
    of 2008. In August 2006, the company’s Board of Directors
    authorized using up to $620 of the net proceeds from the sale of
    the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to purchase company
    stock. This program was completed at the end of fiscal 2007. In
    March 2008, the company’s Board of Directors authorized
    using approximately $600 of the net proceeds from the sale of
    the Godiva Chocolatier business to purchase company stock. This
    program was completed during the fourth quarter of 2008. In June
    2008, the company’s Board of Directors authorized the
    purchase of up to $1,200 of company stock through fiscal 2011.
    This program began in fiscal 2009. In addition to these publicly
    announced programs, the company repurchases shares to offset the
    impact of dilution from shares issued under the company’s
    stock compensation plans.

In 2009, the company repurchased 17 million shares at a
    cost of $527. Of the 2009 repurchases, approximately
    13 million shares at a cost of $400 were made pursuant to
    the company’s June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase
    program. Approximately $800 remains available under this program
    as of August 2, 2009.

In 2008, the company repurchased 26 million shares at a
    cost of $903. Of the 2008 repurchases, approximately
    23 million shares at a cost of $800 were made pursuant to
    the company’s November 2005 and the March 2008 publicly
    announced share repurchase programs.

In 2007, the company repurchased 30 million shares at a
    cost of $1,140. Of the 2007 repurchases, approximately
    21 million shares at a cost of $820 were made pursuant to
    the company’s then publicly announced share repurchase
    programs, with a portion executed under two accelerated share
    repurchase agreements (Agreements) with Lehman Brothers
    Financial S.A. (Lehman), an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc.,
    covering approximately $600 of common stock. The Agreements were
    entered into on September 28, 2006.

Under the first Agreement, the company purchased approximately
    8.3 million shares of its common stock from Lehman for
    $300, or $35.95 per share, subject to a purchase price
    adjustment payable upon settlement of the Agreement. Lehman was
    expected to purchase an equivalent number of shares during the
    term of the Agreement. On July 5, 2007, upon conclusion of
    the Agreement, the company made a settlement payment of $22 to
    Lehman, which was recorded as a reduction of Additional paid-in
    capital, based upon the difference between the volume
    weighted-average price of the company’s common stock during
    the Agreement’s term of $38.90 and the purchase price of
    $35.95.

Under the second Agreement, the company purchased approximately
    $300 of its common stock from Lehman. Under this Agreement,
    Lehman made an initial delivery of 6.3 million shares on
    September 29, 2006 at $35.95 per share and a second
    delivery of 1.3 million shares on October 25, 2006 at
    $36.72 per share. Under the Agreement, the number of additional
    shares (if any) to be delivered to the company at settlement
    would be based on the volume

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

weighted-average price of company stock during the term of the
    Agreement, subject to a minimum and maximum price for the
    purchased shares. The volume weighted-average price during the
    term of the Agreement was $38.90. On July 5, 2007, upon
    conclusion of the Agreement, Lehman delivered approximately
    200,000 shares to the company as a final settlement.
    Approximately $20 paid under the Agreement was recorded as a
    reduction of Additional paid-in capital.

Stock
    Plans

In 2003, shareowners approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan,
    which authorized the issuance of 28 million shares to
    satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
    unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including
    performance restricted stock) and performance units.
    Approximately 3.2 million shares available under a previous
    long-term plan were rolled into the 2003 Long-Term Incentive
    Plan, making the total number of available shares approximately
    31.2 million. In November 2005, shareowners approved the
    2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of
    an additional 6 million shares to satisfy the same types of
    awards.

Awards under the 2003 and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans may be
    granted to employees and directors. The term of a stock option
    granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date
    of grant. Options granted under these plans vest cumulatively
    over a three-year period at a rate of 30%, 60% and 100%,
    respectively. The option price may not be less than the fair
    market value of a share of common stock on the date of the
    grant. Restricted stock granted in fiscal 2004 and 2005 vests in
    three annual installments of


/


each, beginning


/


years from the date of grant.

Pursuant to the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, in July 2005 the
    company adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which
    provides for grants of total shareowner return (TSR) performance
    restricted stock/units, EPS performance restricted stock/units,
    and time-lapse restricted stock/units. Initial grants made in
    accordance with this program were approved in September 2005.
    Under the program, awards of TSR performance restricted
    stock/units will be earned by comparing the company’s total
    shareowner return during a three-year period to the respective
    total shareowner returns of companies in a performance peer
    group. Based upon the company’s ranking in the performance
    peer group, a recipient of TSR performance restricted
    stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of
    the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted
    stock/units will be earned based upon the company’s
    achievement of annual earnings per share goals. During the
    three-year vesting period, a recipient of EPS performance
    restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to
    100% of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted
    stock/units will vest ratably over the three-year period. Annual
    stock option grants are not part of the long-term incentive
    compensation program for 2007, 2008 and 2009. However, stock
    options may still be granted on a selective basis under the 2003
    and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans.

Total pre-tax stock-based compensation recognized in Earnings
    from continuing operations was $84 for 2009, $83 for 2008 and
    $79 for 2007. Tax related benefits of $31 were recognized for
    2009 and for 2008, and $29 were recognized for 2007. Stock-based
    compensation associated with discontinued operations was $3 and
    $2 after-tax in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2009, 2008

    company measured the fair value of stock options using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The fair value of time-lapse restricted stock/units and EPS
    performance restricted stock/units is determined based on the
    number of shares granted and the quoted price of the
    company’s stock at the date of grant. Time-lapse restricted
    stock/units granted in 2005 are expensed on a graded-vesting
    basis. Time-lapse restricted stock/units granted in fiscal 2006
    and forward are expensed on a straight-line basis over the
    vesting period, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible
    participants, which are expensed on an accelerated basis. EPS
    performance restricted stock/units are expensed on a
    graded-vesting basis, except for awards issued to
    retirement-eligible participants, which are expensed on an
    accelerated basis.

As of August 2, 2009, total remaining unearned compensation
    related to nonvested time-lapse restricted stock/units and EPS
    performance restricted stock/units was $37, which will be
    amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of
    1.7 years. The fair value of restricted stock/units vested
    during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $47, $70 and $53, respectively.
    The weighted-average grant-date fair value of restricted
    stock/units granted during 2008 and 2007 was $36.57 and $36.14,
    respectively.

The fair value of TSR performance restricted stock/units is
    estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation.
    Expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service
    period. As of August 2, 2009, total remaining unearned
    compensation related to TSR performance restricted stock/units
    was $51 which will be amortized over the weighted-average
    remaining service period of 1.8 years. In the first quarter
    of fiscal 2009, recipients of TSR performance restricted
    stock/units earned 125% of their initial grants based upon the
    company’s total shareowner return ranking in a performance
    peer group during a three-year period ended July 31, 2008.
    As a result, approximately 280,000 additional shares were
    awarded. The total fair value of TSR performance restricted
    stock/units vested during 2009 was $58. The grant-date fair
    value of TSR performance restricted stock/units granted during
    2008 and 2007 was $34.64 and $26.31, respectively.

Prior to fiscal 2009, employees could elect to defer all types
    of restricted stock awards. These awards are classified as
    liabilities because of the possibility that they may be settled
    in cash. The fair value is adjusted quarterly. The total cash
    paid to settle the liabilities in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was not
    material. The liability for deferred awards was $8 at
    August 2, 2009.

The excess tax benefits on the exercise of stock options and
    vested restricted stock presented as cash flows from financing
    activities in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $18, $8 and $25,
    respectively. Cash received from the exercise of stock options
    was $72, $47 and $165 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and
    is reflected in cash flows from financing activities in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

For the periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of
    Earnings, the calculations of basic earnings per share and
    earnings per share assuming dilution vary in that the weighted
    average shares outstanding assuming dilution include the
    incremental effect of stock options and restricted stock
    programs, except when such effect would be antidilutive. The
    dilutive impact of the accelerated share repurchase agreements
    described under “Share Repurchase Programs” was not
    material. Stock options to purchase approximately 3 million
    of shares of capital stock for 2009 and 1 million shares of
    capital stock for 2008 and 2007 were not included in the
    calculation for diluted earnings per share because the exercise
    price of the stock options exceeded the average market price of
    the capital stock, and therefore, would be antidilutive.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

In February 2002, VFB L.L.C., an entity representing the
    interests of the unsecured creditors of Vlasic Foods
    International Inc., a company spun off by Campbell in March
    1998, commenced a lawsuit against the company and several of its
    subsidiaries in the United States District Court for the
    District of Delaware alleging, among other things, fraudulent
    conveyance, illegal dividends and breaches of fiduciary duty by
    Vlasic directors alleged to be under the company’s control.
    In September 2005, the District Court ruled in favor of
    Campbell, finding that Vlasic Foods was solvent at the time of
    the spin off transaction, and that Campbell is not liable to the
    plaintiff for the claims of Vlasic’s unsecured creditors or
    for any other claims or damages. The judgment of the District
    Court was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the
    Third Circuit in March of 2007. The case is closed.

The company is a party to legal proceedings and claims arising
    out of the normal course of business.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Management assesses the probability of loss for all legal
    proceedings and claims and has recognized liabilities for such
    contingencies, as appropriate. Although the results of these
    matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in management’s
    opinion, the final outcome of legal proceedings and claims will
    not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results
    of operations or financial condition of the company.

The company has certain operating lease commitments, primarily
    related to warehouse and office facilities, retail store space
    and certain equipment. Rent expense under operating lease
    commitments was $47 in 2009, $80 in 2008 and $82 in 2007. These
    amounts included $33 and $42 in 2008 and 2007, respectively,
    related to discontinued operations. Future minimum annual rental
    payments under these operating leases are as follows:

$57

The company guarantees approximately 1,900 bank loans made to
    Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party
    financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes.
    The maximum potential amount of future payments the company
    could be required to make under the guarantees is $159. The
    company’s guarantees are indirectly secured by the
    distribution routes. The company does not believe it is probable
    that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result
    of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. The amounts recognized
    as of August 2, 2009 and August 3, 2008 were not
    material.

In connection with the sale of certain Australian salty snack
    food brands and assets, the company agreed to provide a loan
    facility to the buyer of AUD $10, or approximately USD $7. The
    facility was drawn down in AUD $5 increments in 2009. Borrowings
    under the facility are to be repaid five years after the closing
    date.

The company has provided certain standard indemnifications in
    connection with divestitures, contracts and other transactions.
    Certain indemnifications have finite expiration dates.
    Liabilities recognized based on known exposures related to such
    matters were not material at August 2, 2009.

The deferred compensation obligation represents unfunded plans
    maintained for the purpose of providing the company’s
    directors and certain of its executives the opportunity to defer
    a portion of their compensation. All forms of compensation
    contributed to the deferred compensation plans are accounted for
    in accordance with the underlying program. Contributions are
    credited to an investment account in the participant’s
    name, although no funds are actually contributed to the
    investment account and no investment choices are actually
    purchased. Six investment choices are available, including:
    (1) a book account that tracks the total return on company
    stock; (2) a book account that tracks performance of
    Fidelity’s Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund; (3) a book
    account that tracks the performance of Fidelity’s Puritan
    Fund; (4) a book account that tracks the performance of
    Fidelity’s Spartan International Index Fund; (5) a
    book account that tracks the performance of Fidelity’s
    Spartan Extended Market Index Fund; and (6) a book account
    that credits interest based on the Wall Street Journal indexed
    prime rate. Participants can reallocate investments daily and
    are entitled to the gains and losses on investment funds. The
    company recognizes an amount in the Statements of Earnings for
    the market appreciation/depreciation of each fund.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the
    company’s management in conformity with generally accepted
    accounting principles to reflect the financial position of the
    company and its operating results. The financial information
    appearing throughout this Annual Report is consistent with the
    financial statements. Management is responsible for the
    information and representations in such financial statements,
    including the estimates and judgments required for their

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
    entirely of Directors who are not officers or employees of the
    company, meets regularly with the company’s worldwide

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America.

The company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    Directors of the company; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
    the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
    the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    August 2, 2009. In making this assessment, management used
    the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on this
    assessment using those criteria, management concluded that the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of August 2, 2009.



The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of August 2, 2009 has been audited
    by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareowners and Directors of Campbell Soup Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of earnings, of
    shareowners’ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Campbell Soup
    Company and its subsidiaries at August 2, 2009 and
    August 3, 2008, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
    period ended August 2, 2009 in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of August 2, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report
    on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 and Note 9 the Company changed
    the manner in which it accounts for uncertainty in income taxes
    in 2008, and the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement plans in 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
