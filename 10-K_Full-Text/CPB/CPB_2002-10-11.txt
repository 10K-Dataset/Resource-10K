PART I

Item 1. Business

The Company

Campbell Soup Company (“Campbell” or the “company”), together with its
consolidated subsidiaries, is the world’s largest manufacturer and marketer of
soups and a leading manufacturer of juice beverages, sauces, biscuits and
confectionery products. Campbell was incorporated as a business corporation
under the laws of New Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through predecessor
organizations, it traces its heritage in the food business back to 1869. The
company’s principal executive offices are in Camden, New Jersey
08103-1799.

Through fiscal 2001, the company operated in three business segments: Soup and
Sauces, Biscuits and Confectionery, and Away From Home. Beginning in fiscal
2002, the company changed its organizational structure such that operations are
managed and reported in four segments: North America Soup and Away From Home,
North America Sauces and Beverages, Biscuits and Confectionery, and
International Soup and Sauces. The segments are discussed in greater detail
below.

As previously reported, on July 27, 2001, the company announced a series of
multi-year investment initiatives designated as the “transformation plan” aimed
at strengthening the company’s position in the soup, sauces, beverages and
indulgent snack categories, both in the United States and internationally.
These initiatives continue, with a majority of the investment focused on the
company’s U.S. soup business. The initiatives are designed to improve product
quality, increase marketing and accelerate innovation. They have resulted in, among other things, increased spending on total
marketing, capital improvements, systems infrastructure and research and
development. The company expects to continue implementing these initiatives
through fiscal year 2003 and beyond. For more information on the impact of
these initiatives on the company’s financial condition and results of
operations, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
and Financial Condition” and the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements
(and the Notes thereto) at pages 23 through 49 of the company’s 2002 Annual
Report to Shareowners for the fiscal year ended July 28, 2002 (“2002 Annual
Report”), which is incorporated herein by reference.

On October 1, 2001, Pepperidge
Farm, Incorporated, a leading provider of premium quality
baked goods, cookies and crackers and one of the company’s wholly-owned
subsidiaries, announced plans to build a new bakery in the greater Hartford
area of Connecticut. The new facility will produce breads, rolls and stuffing
to meet the demand for baked goods in the Northeastern United States.
Construction of the new facility is progressing, and it is expected to start
operations in 2003. The new facility will replace Pepperidge Farm’s existing
Norwalk, Connecticut bakery.

On June 4, 2002, the company announced that its Australian subsidiary, Arnotts
Biscuits Holdings Pty Ltd, had agreed to acquire by way of
a cash tender offer all of the shares of Snack Foods Limited, a leader in the
Australian salty snack category, for approximately $145
million. On July 30, 2002, the company announced that Arnotts Holding had
received acceptances for more than 90 percent of the shares of Snack Foods.
The tendered shares were purchased in August of 2002. Under Australian
corporate law, once Arnott’s Holding acquired 90 percent of Snack Foods, it was
entitled to acquire the remaining outstanding shares regardless of whether they
were tendered into the offer. Arnotts



Holdings acquired the remaining outstanding
shares on September 20, 2002 and now owns 100% of the
outstanding shares of Snack Foods.

On June 28, 2002, the company announced that it has agreed to purchase
Ireland’s second largest dry soup business, Erin Foods, from Greencore Group
plc for approximately $26 million. The Erin Foods purchase agreement also
includes William Rodgers Foods, a private label supplier in the United Kingdom.
The acquisition closed on September 20, 2002.

See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition” and the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements (and
the Notes thereto) at pages 23 through 49 of the company’s 2002 Annual Report,
which is incorporated herein by reference.

Ingredients

The ingredients required for the manufacture of the company’s food products are
purchased from various suppliers. While all such ingredients are available
from numerous independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations
in price attributable to a number of factors, including changes in crop size,
cattle cycles, government-sponsored agricultural programs and weather
conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons. Ingredient inventories
are at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring.
Since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient
quantities only at certain seasons, the company makes commitments for the
purchase of such ingredients during their respective seasons. In spite of the
foregoing, the company does not anticipate any material restrictions on
availability or shortages of ingredients that would have a significant impact
on the company’s businesses.

Customers

In the United States, sales solicitation activities are conducted by the
company’s own sales force and through broker and distributor arrangements. The
company’s products are generally resold to consumers in retail food chains,
mass discounters, club stores and other retail establishments. Shipments are made promptly
by the company after receipt and acceptance of orders.

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
accounted for approximately 12% of the company’s consolidated net sales during
fiscal 2002. All of the company’s segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc. and its affiliates.

respect to

the company’s discretion to extend beyond that date.

Although the company owns a number of valuable patents, it does not regard any
segment of its business as being dependent upon any single patent or any group
of related patents.

Competition

The company experiences intense worldwide competition in all of its principal
products. This competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes,
including producers of generic and private label products, as well as from
manufacturers of other food products, which compete for trade merchandising
support and consumer dollars. As such, the number of competitors cannot be
reliably estimated. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition,
quality, price, advertising, promotion and service.



Working Capital

For information relating to the company’s cash and other working capital items,
see pages 23 through 31 of the company’s 2002 Annual Report in the section
entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition”, which are incorporated herein
by reference.

Research And Development

During the last three fiscal years, the company’s expenditures on research
activities relating to new products and the improvement of existing products
were approximately $77 million in 2002, $63 million in 2001 and $64 million in
2000. The increase in research and development spending in 2002 is consistent
with the previously announced investment initiatives. The company conducts
this research primarily at its headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, although
important research is also undertaken in various other locations
inside and outside of the United
States.

Environmental Matters

The company has programs for the operation and design of its facilities that
meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations. The company’s
expenditures for capital improvements during fiscal 2002 were approximately
$269 million, of which approximately $7 million was for compliance with
environmental laws and regulations in the United States. The company further
estimates that approximately $9 million of the capital expenditures anticipated
during fiscal 2003 will be for compliance with such environmental laws and
regulations. The company believes that continued compliance with existing
environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on capital
expenditures, earnings, or the competitive position of the company. Additional
information regarding the company’s environmental matters is set forth in Part
I, Item 3 of this report on pages 7 and 8 under the heading “Legal
Proceedings.”

Employees

At July 28, 2002, there were approximately 25,000 persons employed by the
company.

Financial Information

For information with respect to revenue, operating profitability and
identifiable assets attributable to the company’s business segments and
geographic areas, see pages 38 through 39 of the 2002 Annual Report in the
section of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements entitled “Business
and Geographic Segment Information,” which are incorporated herein by
reference.

Cautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results

From time to time, the company makes oral and written statements that reflect
the company’s current expectations regarding future results of operations,
economic performance, financial condition and achievements of the company. The
company tries, wherever possible, to identify these forward looking statements
by using words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “will”
and similar expressions in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of
the company’s “transformation plan.” One can also identify them by the fact
that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These
statements reflect the company’s current plans and expectations and are based
on



information currently available to it. They rely on a number of assumptions
regarding future events and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are
inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.

Campbell wishes to caution the reader that the following important factors and
those important factors described in other Securities and Exchange Commission
filings of the company, or in the company’s 2002 Annual Report, could affect the company’s actual results and could cause
such results to vary materially from the stated goals expressed in any
forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company:

This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive, but is designed to
highlight important factors that may impact the company’s outlook. The company
disclaims any obligation or intent to update any forward-looking statements
made by the company in order to reflect new information, events or
circumstances after the date they are made.



Item 2. Properties

The company’s principal executive offices and main research facilities are
company-owned and located in Camden, New Jersey. The following table sets
forth the company’s principal manufacturing facilities:

Principal Manufacturing Facilities

Each of the foregoing manufacturing facilities is company-owned, except that
the Utrecht, Netherlands facility, the Woodinville, Washington facility and
portions of the Ashford, United Kingdom facility are subject to long-term
leases. The company also operates retail confectionery shops in the United
States, Canada, Europe and Asia; retail bakery thrift stores in the United
States; and other plants, facilities and offices at various locations in the
United States and abroad.

Management believes that the company’s manufacturing and processing plants are
well maintained and are generally adequate to support the current operations of
the businesses.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

As previously reported, ten purported class action lawsuits were commenced
against the company and certain of its officers in the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey. The lawsuits were subsequently
consolidated, and an amended consolidated complaint was filed alleging, among
other things, that the company and certain of its officers misrepresented the
company’s financial condition between September 8, 1997 and January 8, 1999, by
failing to disclose alleged shipping and



revenue recognition practices in
connection with the sale of certain company products at the end of
the company’s fiscal quarters in violation of Section 10 (b) and 20 (a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated
thereunder. The actions seek compensation and other damages, and costs and
expenses associated with the litigation. The company believes the action is
without merit and intends to defend the case vigorously.

As also previously reported, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(the “EPA”) sent the company a special notice letter dated September 28, 2000
relating to the Puente Valley Operable Unit of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund
Sites, Los Angeles County, California (the “Site”) for property located at 125
N. Orange Avenue, Industry, California, advising that the EPA considers the
company to be a potentially responsible party due to the alleged release or
threatened release of hazardous substances, and therefore, potentially
responsible for the costs incurred in connection with contamination at the
Site. In July 2002, the company entered into a settlement agreement with
another potentially responsible party regarding implementation of an EPA
required interim remedy for the Site. Under the agreement, the company paid
under $2,000,000 to the other party, in return for which, among other things,
the other party agreed to implement the interim remedy and to negotiate a
consent decree with the EPA that would provide certain legal protections to the
company from non-settling third parties. While it is possible that additional
remedies may be required in the future, such possible future requirements are
not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows of the company.

As also previously reported, on March 30, 1998, the company effected a spinoff
of several of its non-core businesses to Vlasic Foods International Inc.
(“VFI”). VFI and several of its affiliates (collectively, “Vlasic”) commenced
cases under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 29, 2001 in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Vlasic’s Second Amended
Joint Plan of Distribution under Chapter 11 (the “Plan”) was confirmed by an
order of the Bankruptcy Court dated November 16, 2001, and became effective on
or about November 29, 2001. The Plan provides for the assignment of various
causes of action allegedly belonging to the Vlasic estates, including claims
against the company allegedly arising from the spinoff, to VFB LLC, a limited
liability company (“VFB”) whose membership interests are to be distributed
under the Plan to Vlasic’s general unsecured creditors.

On February 19, 2002, VFB commenced a lawsuit against the company and several
of its subsidiaries in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware alleging, among other things, fraudulent conveyance, illegal dividends
and breaches of fiduciary duty by Vlasic directors alleged to be under the
company’s control. The lawsuit seeks to hold the company liable in an amount
necessary to satisfy all unpaid claims against Vlasic (which VFB estimates in
the complaint to be $250,000,000), plus unspecified exemplary and punitive
damages. While this case is still in its early stages and the ultimate
disposition of complex litigation is inherently difficult to assess, the
company believes the action is without merit and intends to defend the case
vigorously.

(2)  The company’s Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) allows participants
the opportunity to invest in various book accounts, including a book account that
tracks the performance of the company’s stock (the “Stock Account”). Upon
distribution, participants may receive the amounts invested in the Stock
Account in the form of shares. Column (a) represents the maximum number of
shares that could be issued upon a complete distribution of all amounts in the
Stock Account. This calculation is based upon the amount of funds in the Stock
Account as of July 28, 2002 and a $22.50 share price, which was the closing
price of a share of company stock on July 26, 2002 (the last business day before
July 28, 2002).

Deferred Compensation Plan

The Plan was approved by the Compensation and Organization Committee of the
Board of Directors. The Plan is an unfunded plan maintained for the purpose of
providing the company’s directors and certain of its executives the opportunity
to defer a portion of their compensation. Plan participants may defer a portion
of their base salaries and all or a portion of their annual incentive
compensation, long-term incentive awards, certain stock option gains and
director retainers and fees.

Each participant’s contributions to the Plan are credited to an investment
account in the participant’s name. Gains and losses in the participant’s
account are based on the performance of the investment choices the participant
has selected. Four investment choices are available, including the Stock
Account.

A participant may reallocate his or her investment account daily among the four
investment choices, except that (i) stock option gains must be invested in the
Stock Account, (ii) restricted stock awards must be invested in the Stock
Account during the restriction period and (iii) reallocations of
the Stock Account must be made in compliance with the company’s
policies on trading company stock. Dividends on amounts invested in the
Stock Account may be reallocated among the four investment accounts.

The company credits a participant’s account with an amount equal to the
matching contribution that the company would have made to the participant’s
401(k) Plan account if the participant had not deferred compensation under the
Plan. In addition, for those individuals whose base salary and annual
incentive compensation exceed the Internal Revenue Service indexed compensation
limit for the 401(k) Plan, the company credits such individual’s account with
an amount equal to the contribution the company would have made to the 401(k)
Plan but for the compensation limit. These company contributions vest in 20%
increments over the next five (5) years.

The Plan administrator has established procedures covering the payment of a
participant’s account upon the participant’s termination, retirement or death.
The Plan administrator has also established procedures for hardship withdrawals
and unplanned withdrawals (with a penalty). In the event of a change in
control of the company, the Stock Account is automatically converted into cash
based upon a formula provided in the Plan.
