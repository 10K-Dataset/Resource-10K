Item 1. Business

The Company

Campbell Soup Company (“Campbell” or the “company”), together
with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a global manufacturer and marketer of
high quality, branded, convenience food products. Campbell was incorporated
as a business corporation under the laws of New Jersey on November 23, 1922;
however, through predecessor organizations, it traces its heritage in the
food business back to 1869. The company’s principal executive offices are in
Camden, New Jersey 08103-1799.

On June 24, 2004, the company announced a series of initiatives designed to
improve the company’s sales growth and the quality and growth of its
earnings. These include the following:

•

The elimination of approximately 400 positions worldwide, which
resulted in a pre-tax charge of $23 million, or three cents per
share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004;

•

The implementation of a new sales and distribution system for the
company’s business in Australia, converting from a direct store
delivery system to a central warehouse system. As a result of this
new system, over 200 positions are expected to be eliminated, with
most of the terminations occurring in fiscal 2005. The company
recorded a pre-tax charge of $9 million, or two cents per share,
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 related to this new system;

•

The implementation of a new SAP enterprise-resource planning
system in North America. The project is planned for the next three
years and is expected to cost approximately $125 million; and

•

An expanded focus on convenience and availability as the primary
sources of incremental future revenue growth, along with an
increased emphasis on “wellness” initiatives.

See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition” and the Consolidated Financial Statements (and the Notes
thereto).

Through fiscal 2004, the company’s operations were organized and reported in
four segments: North America Soup and Away From Home, North America Sauces
and Beverages, Biscuits and Confectionery, and International Soup and Sauces.
The segments are discussed in greater detail below.

North America Soup and Away From Home

The North America Soup and Away From
Home segment comprises the retail soup and Away From Home business in the
U.S. and Canada. The U.S. retail business includes the

Campbell’s

brand
condensed and ready-to-serve soups and

Swanson

broths. The segment includes
the company’s total business in Canada, which comprises

Habitant

and

Campbell’s

soups,

Prego

pasta sauce and

V8

juices. The Away From Home
operations represent the distribution of products such as

Campbell’s

soups,

Campbell’s

specialty entrees, beverage products, other prepared foods and

Pepperidge Farm

products through various food service channels in
North America.

North America Sauces and Beverages

The North America Sauces and Beverages
segment includes U.S. retail sales for

Prego

pasta sauces,

Pace

Mexican
sauces,

Franco-American

canned pastas and gravies,

V8

vegetable juices,

V8
Splash

juice beverages, and

Campbell’s

tomato juice, as well as the total of
all businesses in Mexico and other Latin American and Caribbean countries.
The company operates this segment and the North America Soup and Away From
Home operations under an integrated supply chain organization, in which these
operations share substantially all manufacturing, warehouse, distribution and
sales activities.

Biscuits and Confectionery

The Biscuits and Confectionery segment includes
all retail sales of

Pepperidge Farm

cookies, crackers, breads and frozen
products in the United States,

Arnott’s

biscuits and crackers in Australia
and Asia Pacific, Arnott’s Snackfoods salty snacks in Australia, and

Godiva

chocolates worldwide.

International Soup and Sauces

The International Soup and Sauces segment
comprises operations outside of North America, including

Erasco

and

Heisse
Tasse

soups in Germany,

Liebig

and

Royco

soups and

Lesieur

sauces in France,

Campbell’s

and

Batchelors

soups,

OXO

stock cubes and

Homepride

sauces in the
United Kingdom,

Devos Lemmens

mayonnaise and cold sauces and

Campbell’s

and

Royco

soups in Belgium,

Blå Band

soups and sauces in Sweden, and

McDonnells

and

Erin

soups in Ireland. In Asia Pacific, operations include

Campbell’s

soup and stock and

Swanson

broths across the region.

Ingredients

The ingredients required for the manufacture of the company’s
food products are purchased from various suppliers. While all such
ingredients are available from numerous independent suppliers, raw materials
are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors,
including changes in crop size, cattle cycles, government-sponsored
agricultural programs, import and export requirements and weather conditions
during the growing and harvesting seasons. Ingredient inventories are at a
peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring. Since
many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities
only at certain seasons, the company makes commitments for the purchase of
such ingredients during their respective seasons. At this time, the company
does not anticipate any material restrictions on availability or shortages of
ingredients that would have a significant impact on the company’s businesses.
For information relating to the impact of inflation on the company, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition.”

Customers

In the United States, Canada, Europe and the Asia Pacific region,
sales solicitation activities are conducted by the company’s own sales force
and through broker and distributor



arrangements. In the United States and
Canada, the company’s products are generally resold to consumers in retail
food chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience
stores, drug stores and other retail establishments. In Europe, the company’s
products are generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass
discounters and other retail establishments. In the Asia Pacific region, the
company’s products are generally resold to consumers through retail food
chains, convenience stores, vending machines and other retail establishments.
Godiva’s products are sold generally through a network of company-owned
retail boutiques in North America, Europe, and Asia, franchised third-party
retail boutique operators in Europe, third-party distributors in Europe and
Asia, and major retailers, including finer department stores
and duty-free shops, worldwide. Godiva’s products are also sold through
catalogs and on the Internet, although these sales are primarily limited to
North America. The company makes shipments promptly after receipt and
acceptance of orders.

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
accounted for approximately 13% of the company’s consolidated net sales
during fiscal 2004 and 12% during fiscal 2003. All of the company’s segments
sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates.

Trademarks and Technology

The company owns over 6,900 trademark registrations
and applications in over 160 countries and believes that its trademarks are
of material importance to its business. Although the laws vary by
jurisdiction, trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use
and/or their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to
have become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be renewed
indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. The company believes that
its principal brands, including

Campbell’s, Erasco, Liebig, Pepperidge Farm,
V8, Pace, Prego, Swanson, Batchelors, Arnott’s,

and

Godiva,

are protected by
trademark law in the company’s relevant major markets. In addition, some of
the company’s products are sold under brands that have been licensed from
third parties.

Although the company owns a number of valuable patents, it does not regard
any segment of its business as being dependent upon any single patent or
group of related patents. In addition, the company owns copyrights, both
registered and unregistered, and proprietary trade secrets, technology,
know-how processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not
registered.

Competition

The company experiences worldwide competition in all of its
principal products. This competition arises from numerous competitors of
varying sizes, including producers of generic and private label products, as
well as from manufacturers of other branded food products, which compete for
trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. As such, the

number of
competitors cannot be reliably estimated. The principal areas of competition
are brand recognition, quality, price, advertising, promotion and service.

Working Capital

For information relating to the company’s cash and other
working capital items, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results
of Operations and Financial Condition.”

Research and Development

During the last three fiscal years, the company’s
expenditures on research activities relating to new products and the
improvement and maintenance of existing products were $93 million in 2004,
$88 million in 2003 and $79 million in 2002. The increase in research and
development spending in 2004 is primarily due to currency fluctuations. The
increase from 2002 to 2003 was consistent with previously announced
investment initiatives designed to drive top line growth and improve the
company’s cost position. The company conducts this research primarily at its
headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, although important research is also
undertaken in various other locations inside and outside the United States.

Environmental Matters

The company has programs for the operation and design
of its facilities that meet or exceed
applicable environmental rules and regulations. The company’s capital
expenditures during fiscal 2004 were $288 million, of which approximately $5
million was for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the
United States. The company further estimates that approximately $6 million of
the capital expenditures anticipated during fiscal 2005 will be for
compliance with such environmental laws and regulations. The company believes
that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations
will not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the
competitive position of the company. Additional information regarding the
company’s environmental matters is set forth in “Legal Proceedings.”

Employees

At August 1, 2004, there were approximately 24,000 full-time
employees of the company.

Financial Information

For information with respect to revenue, operating
profitability and identifiable assets attributable to the company’s business
segments and geographic areas, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The company’s primary corporate website can be found at
www.campbellsoupcompany.com. The company makes available free of charge at

Reports” caption) all of its reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section
13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its annual

other plants, facilities and offices at various locations in the United States and abroad,
including additional executive offices in Norwalk, Connecticut;
Paris, France; and Homebush, Australia.

Management believes that the company’s manufacturing and processing plants
are well maintained and are generally adequate to support the current
operations of the businesses.



Item 3. Legal Proceedings

As previously reported, on March 30, 1998, the company effected a spinoff of
several of its non-core businesses to Vlasic Foods International Inc.
(“VFI”). VFI and several of its affiliates (collectively, “Vlasic”) commenced
cases under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 29, 2001 in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Vlasic’s Second
Amended Joint Plan of Distribution under Chapter 11 (the “Plan”) was
confirmed by an order of the Bankruptcy Court dated November 16, 2001, and
became effective on or about November 29, 2001. The Plan provides for the
assignment of various causes of action allegedly belonging to the Vlasic
estates, including claims against the company allegedly arising from the
spinoff, to VFB L.L.C., a limited liability company (“VFB”) whose membership
interests are to be distributed under the Plan to Vlasic’s general unsecured
creditors.

On February 19, 2002, VFB commenced a lawsuit against the company and several
of its subsidiaries in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware alleging, among other things, fraudulent conveyance, illegal
dividends and breaches of fiduciary duty by Vlasic directors alleged to be
under the company’s control. The lawsuit seeks to hold the company liable in
an amount necessary to satisfy all unpaid claims against Vlasic (which VFB
estimates in the amended complaint to be $200 million), plus unspecified
exemplary and punitive damages. While the ultimate disposition of complex
litigation is inherently difficult to assess, the company believes the action
is without merit and is defending the case vigorously.

As previously reported, the company received an Examination Report from the
Internal Revenue Service on December 23, 2002, which included a challenge to
the treatment of gains and interest deductions claimed in the company’s
fiscal 1995 federal income tax return, relating to transactions involving
government securities. If the proposed adjustment were upheld, it would
require the company to pay a net amount of approximately $100 million in
taxes, accumulated interest to December 23, 2002, and penalties. Interest
will continue to accrue until the matter is resolved. The company believes
these transactions were properly reported on its federal income tax return in
accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations in effect during the
period involved and is challenging these adjustments vigorously. While the
outcome of proceedings of this type cannot be predicted with certainty, the
company believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a
material impact on the consolidated financial condition or results of
operation of the company.

As previously reported, in July 2003, the company began discussions with the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (“WDNR”) regarding certain air
emissions from the company’s Milwaukee, Wisconsin flavoring and spice mix
plant. These emissions may have exceeded limits established pursuant to the

Wisconsin Clean Air Act Program. As a result of these discussions, the
company has (i) installed air emission control equipment at a cost of
approximately $700 thousand, and (ii) submitted a payment of approximately
$50 thousand to the WDNR for additional emission fees. As of August 1, 2004,
in addition to the amounts described above, the company incurred costs of
approximately $275 thousand related to the evaluation of this issue. While
the WDNR may require additional
expenditures, the company believes that the WDNR is unlikely to do so and
that, in the event that the WDNR does impose such additional expenditures,
they would not have a material impact on the consolidated financial condition
or results of operation of the company.

As previously reported, on April 22, 2004, the company entered into an
Administrative Consent Order (“ACO”) with the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”) to settle alleged violations of the New
Jersey Air Pollution Control Act related to certain air emissions from the
company’s South Plainfield, New Jersey flavoring and spice mix plant. Under
the ACO, the company agreed to (i) modify existing process equipment and to
install additional air emission control equipment at a cost of approximately
$1.5 million, (ii) pay a $300 thousand penalty, (iii) pay $100 thousand for a
supplemental environmental project, and (iv) pay approximately $185 thousand
in outstanding air emission fees. The company has complied with its
obligations under the ACO, and the company expects the ACO to be officially
terminated following an inspection by the NJDEP. The ACO does not constitute
an admission of liability by the company.

As previously reported, on July 15, 2003, Pepperidge Farm, Incorporated, an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, made a submission to the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) relating to its use and
replacement of certain appliances containing ozone-depleting refrigerants.
The submission was made pursuant to the terms of the Ozone-Depleting
Substance Emission Reduction Bakery Partnership Agreement (the “EPA
Agreement”) entered into by and between Pepperidge Farm and the EPA.
Pepperidge Farm executed the EPA Agreement in April 2002 as part of a
voluntary EPA-sponsored program relating to the reduction of ozone-depleting
refrigerants used in the bakery industry. As a result of the EPA Agreement,
as of August 1, 2004, Pepperidge Farm has incurred costs of approximately
$4.75 million relating to the evaluation and replacement of certain of its
refrigerant appliances. Of this amount, $4 million was incurred in fiscal
2003; the remainder was incurred in fiscal 2004. If the submission is
approved by the EPA, in addition to the expenditures previously made,
Pepperidge Farm will be required to pay a penalty in the amount of
approximately $370 thousand. The company does not expect that the cost of
complying with the EPA Agreement will have a material impact on the
consolidated financial condition or results of operation of the company.

In 2003, the company adopted SFAS No. 142 resulting in the elimination of
amortization of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Prior
periods have not been restated. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

The 2003 fiscal year consisted of fifty-three weeks compared to fifty-two
weeks in all other periods. The additional week contributed 2 percentage
points of the sales increase compared to 2002, and approximately $.02 per
share to net earnings.

In 2002, financial results were restated to conform to the requirements of
new accounting standards. Certain consumer and trade promotional expenses
have been reclassified from Marketing and selling expenses and Cost of
products sold to Net sales for years 2000 to 2001.


2004 results include pre-tax restructuring charges of $32 ($22 after
tax or $.05 per share basic and assuming dilution) related to a
reduction in workforce and the implementation of a distribution and
logistics realignment in Australia.


2003 results include pre-tax costs of $1 ($1 after tax) related to an
Australian manufacturing reconfiguration. These costs were recorded in
Cost of products sold.


2002 results include pre-tax costs of $20 ($14 after tax or $.03 per
share basic and assuming dilution) related to an Australian
manufacturing reconfiguration. Of this amount, pre-tax costs of
approximately $19 were recorded in Cost of products sold.


2001 results include pre-tax costs of $15 ($11 after tax or $.03 per
share basic and assuming dilution) related to an Australian
manufacturing reconfiguration. Of this amount, pre-tax costs of
approximately $5 were recorded in Cost of products sold.



Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition

Results of Operations

Overview


Net earnings were $647 million ($1.57 per share) in 2004 compared to
$626 million before the cumulative effect of accounting change ($1.52 per
share) in 2003. (All earnings per share amounts included in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis are presented on a diluted basis.) The 2004 results
were impacted by the following:

•

A pre-tax restructuring charge of $32 million ($22 million after tax or $.05 per share) related to a reduction in
workforce and the implementation of a distribution and logistics realignment in Australia. (See also the section
entitled Restructuring Program and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);

•

A pre-tax gain of $16 million ($10 million after tax or $.02 per share) from a settlement of a class action lawsuit
involving ingredient suppliers; and

•

A pre-tax gain of $10 million ($6 million after tax or $.02 per share) from a sale of a manufacturing site in California.

The gains were recorded in Other expenses/(income).

Comparisons between 2004 and 2003 of earnings before the cumulative effect of
accounting change were also impacted by an increase in sales, favorable
currency translation, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate, partially
offset by a decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales and higher
administrative expenses. In addition, there were 52 weeks in 2004 and 53
weeks in 2003. The additional week contributed approximately $.02 per share
to earnings.

In the first quarter 2004, the company acquired certain Australian chocolate
biscuit brands for approximately $9 million. These brands are included in the
Biscuits and Confectionery segment.


In 2003, earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting change
increased 19% to $626 million from $525 million and earnings per share
increased 19% to $1.52 from $1.28 in 2002. Comparisons to 2002 were impacted
by the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.142
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” as of the beginning of 2003. In
accordance with the provisions of this standard, the company discontinued
amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on a
prospective basis

from the date of adoption. Had such amortization been
eliminated as of the beginning of 2002, net earnings for 2002 would have been
$579 million, or $1.41 per share. The 2002 results included a restructuring
charge and related costs of approximately $20 million pre-tax ($.03 per
share) associated with the Australian manufacturing reconfiguration. Pre-tax
charges of $19 million were classified as Cost of products sold and
$1 million were classified as a Restructuring charge. The increase in
earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting change in 2003 was
primarily related to higher sales during the year, lower interest expense,
and a lower effective tax rate compared to 2002, partially offset by higher
administrative expenses and higher pension expense. The additional week
contributed approximately $.02 per share to earnings in 2003.

In connection with the adoption of SFAS No.142, the company recognized a
non-cash charge of $31 million (net of a $17 million tax benefit), or $.08
per share, in the first quarter of 2003 as a cumulative effect of accounting
change. This charge related to impaired goodwill associated with the Stockpot
business, a food service business acquired in August 1998. See also Note 3 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Although SFAS No.142 precludes restatement of prior period results, the 2002
segment operating earnings have been adjusted to reflect the pro forma impact
of amortization eliminated under the standard.

During the first quarter ended October 27, 2002, the company acquired two
businesses for cash consideration of approximately $170 million and assumed
debt of approximately $20 million. The company acquired Snack Foods Limited,
a leader in the Australian salty snack category, and Erin Foods, the number
two dry soup manufacturer in Ireland. Snack Foods Limited is included in the
Biscuits and Confectionery segment. Erin Foods is included in the
International Soup and Sauces segment. The businesses have annual sales of
approximately $160 million.

Sales

Sales increased 6% in 2004 to $7.1 billion from $6.7 billion. The
current fiscal year included 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in 2003. The
increase in sales was due to a 2% increase in volume and mix, a 2% increase
due to higher selling prices, a 4% increase due to currency, offset by a 2%
decrease due to one less week in the fiscal year.

Sales increased 9% in 2003 to $6.7 billion from $6.1 billion. The increase in
sales was due to a 1% increase in volume and mix, a 2% increase from the
additional week in 2003, a 1% increase due to higher selling prices, a 3%
increase from currency, and a 2% increase from the acquisitions of Erin Foods
and Snack Foods Limited.

North America Soup and Away From Home sales increased 4% in 2004 versus 2003.
The increase in sales was due to a 1% increase from volume and mix, a 1%
decrease due to one less week in 2004, a 3% increase from higher net price
realization, a 1% decrease due to higher revenue reductions from trade
promotion and consumer coupon redemption programs, and a 2% increase from
currency. In the U.S., ready-to-serve soup sales increased 8% as volume
increased 6%. The ready-to-serve sales performance was driven by the strong
performance on the new

M’m! M’m! Good! To Go

convenience platform including

Campbell’s Select

and

Campbell’s Chunky

soups in microwavable bowls, which
were introduced this year, and

Campbell’s Soup at Hand

sippable soups.
Condensed soup sales were down 2% on volume declines of 4%. Broth sales
increased 6% reflecting volume growth of 5%. Away From Home sales grew
slightly primarily due to strong sales of refrigerated soups. The Canadian
business reported a sales increase versus prior year due to currency.

The 3% increase in sales from North America Soup and Away From Home in 2003
versus 2002 was due to a 1% increase due to the additional week in 2003, a 1%
increase due to lower revenue reductions from trade promotion and consumer
coupon redemption programs, and a 1% increase from currency. U.S. wet soup
volume increased 2% over the prior year. Ready-to-serve volume increased 8%
behind volume gains in

Campbell’s Chunky

and

Campbell’s Select

soups, and the
launch of

Soup at Hand

sippable soups in convenient portable microwavable
packaging.

Swanson

broth reported a volume increase of 13% due to successful
promotional campaigns for cooking with broth. Condensed soup volume declined
6%. Canada reported growth in soup volume, due in part to the regional
introduction of the new

Campbell’s Gardennay

soup in aseptic packages. Away
From Home experienced increased soup volume, offset by declines in lower
margin businesses.

North America Sauces and Beverages sales of $1.2 billion in 2004 were equal
to 2003. Sales were impacted by a 1%
increase from volume and mix, a 2% decrease due to one less week in 2004, and
a 1% increase due to lower revenue reductions from trade promotion and
consumer coupon redemption programs. Sales were favorably impacted by the
growth of beverages, led by sales growth of

V8

vegetable juice. Sales of

Pace

Mexican sauces were equal to 2003.

Prego

pasta sauces experienced a decline
in sales, attributable in part to weakness in the dry pasta category.

The 5% increase in sales from North America Sauces and Beverages in 2003
versus 2002 was due to a 2% increase in volume and mix, a 2% increase due to
the additional week in 2003, a 1% increase from higher net price realization
and a 1% increase due to lower revenue reductions from trade promotion and
consumer coupon redemption programs, offset by a 1% decline due to currency.
The sales increase was driven by strong gains in

Pace

Mexican sauces,

Prego

brand products,

V8

vegetable juices,

Campbell’s

tomato juice, Latin America,
and the introduction of

V8 Splash

Smoothies. The introduction of

Prego

Hearty
Meat sauces and

Pace Mexican Creations

sauces contributed to the sales
growth. These gains were partially offset by declines in

Franco-American

canned pasta and gravies.

Biscuits and Confectionery reported a 12% increase in sales in 2004 due to a
4% increase from volume and mix, a 2% decrease due to one less week in 2004,
a 2% increase from higher net price realization, a decrease of 1% due to
higher revenue reductions from trade promotion and consumer coupon redemption
programs, a 2% increase from the acquisition of Snack Foods Limited in
Australia, and a 7% increase from currency. The favorable currency impact was
attributable primarily to the strengthening of the Australian dollar.
Pepperidge Farm contributed to the sales increase as a result of growth in

Goldfish

crackers and fresh bread. Arnott’s reported a sales increase driven
by innovation on the

Tim Tam, Shapes

and

Jatz

products and new product
offerings in the

Snack Right

and

Salada

brands. Godiva Chocolatier’s
worldwide sales increased due to improving same store sales trends in North
America and increased sales in duty free stores.

Sales from Biscuits and Confectionery increased 18% in 2003 due to a 1%
increase in volume and mix, a 2% increase due to the additional week in 2003,
a 4% increase from higher net price realization, an 8% increase from the
acquisition of Snack Foods Limited in Australia, and a 4% increase from
currency, offset by a 1% increase in revenue reductions from trade promotion
and consumer coupon redemption programs. The favorable currency impact
principally reflected the strengthening of the Australian dollar. Pepperidge
Farm reported sales increases in cookies,



crackers, and fresh bread. Arnott’s
contributed to the sales increase with growth in the chocolate segment and
new products introduced in the year, particularly

Snack Right

fruit-based low
fat biscuits. Godiva Chocolatier’s worldwide sales increased due to growth in
Asia, partially offset by continued weakness in same store sales in North
America.

International Soup and Sauces reported an increase in sales of 12% in 2004.
Improvements in volume and mix added 2% growth offset by a decline of 2% due
to one less week in 2004. The favorable impact of currency accounted for a
12% increase. The increase in volume and mix was driven primarily by sales
gains in France, Australia, Belgium, and Asia, partially offset by sales
declines in the United Kingdom and Germany. In Australia, soup had strong
sales and volume growth driven by

Campbell’s Country Ladle

and

Chunky

soups.

International Soup and Sauces reported a 14% increase in sales in 2003 due to
a 12% increase from currency and a
2% increase from the acquisition of Erin Foods in Ireland. Volume and mix
declined 2% offset by a 2% increase due to the additional week in 2003.
Strong performance of dry soups in Europe was offset by weakness in the wet
soup and sauces businesses in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. The
United Kingdom performance reflected declines in

Homepride

sauces and

Campbell’s

soups. Sales in France declined due primarily to aggressive
competitive activity. In Germany, a significant portion of the private-label
soup business is being discontinued. The Asia Pacific region reported sales
growth.

Gross Margin

Gross margin, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold,
increased by $49 million in 2004. As a percent of sales, gross margin was
41.1% in 2004, 43.0% in 2003 and 43.9% in 2002. The percentage decrease in
2004 was due to costs associated with quality and packaging improvements
(approximately 1 percentage point), mix (approximately 0.7 percentage
points), higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions (approximately
0.3 percentage points), and the impact of inflation and other factors
(approximately 2.7 percentage points), partially offset by higher selling
prices (approximately 0.9 percentage points) and productivity improvements
(approximately 1.9 percentage points). The percentage decrease in 2003 was
due to the lower margin structure of acquisitions (approximately
0.5 percentage points), costs associated with transition and startup of the
new Pepperidge Farm bakery and with the discontinuance of certain co-packing
contracts (approximately 0.3 percentage points), the net impact of mix
(approximately 0.3 percentage points) and inflation/quality improvements
(approximately 2.7 percentage points), partially offset by the benefits of
lower costs related to the Australian manufacturing reconfiguration
(approximately 0.3 percentage

points), pricing (approximately 0.7 percentage
points) and productivity gains (approximately 1.9 percentage points).

Marketing and Selling Expenses

Marketing and selling expenses as a percent
of sales were 16.2% in 2004, 17.1% in 2003 and 17.5% in 2002. Marketing and
selling expenses increased 1% in 2004. The increase was driven by currency,
partially offset by reductions in marketing expenses related to consumer
promotion activity and lower media production costs. In 2003, Marketing and
selling expenses increased 7% from 2002. The increase was driven by currency
and acquisitions (3 percentage points), increased advertising, primarily for

V8 Splash

Smoothies,

V8

juices, and

Pace

Mexican sauces (3 percentage points)
and incremental selling expense due to shelving initiatives and systems
upgrades.

Administrative Expenses

Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were
7.6% in 2004 and 2003. Administrative expenses increased by 7% in 2004 from
2003. Currency accounted for approximately 4 percentage points of the
increase with the balance due to general inflationary increases and costs
associated with litigation. In 2003, Administrative expenses increased to
7.6% of Net sales from 7.4% in 2002. Administrative expenses increased by 12%
from 2002 to 2003. Currency and acquisitions accounted for approximately
5 percentage points of the increase. The remaining increase was driven by a
number of items, including costs associated with litigation, investments in
information technology, and an increase in bad debt expense.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased
$5 million or 6% in 2004
from 2003 primarily due to currency which accounted for approximately
4 percentage points of the increase. Research and development expenses
increased $9 million or 11% in 2003 from 2002 due to costs associated with
quality improvement initiatives and new product development costs
(approximately 8 percentage points) and the impact of currency and
acquisitions (approximately 3 percentage points).

Other Expenses/(Income)

Other income in 2004 of $13 million included a
$16 million gain from the company’s share of a class action settlement
involving ingredient suppliers, a $10 million gain on a sale of a
manufacturing site, other net income of $4 million, partially offset by a
$10 million adjustment to the carrying value of long-term investments in
affordable housing partnerships and $7 million in expense from currency
hedging related to the financing of international activities.

Other expenses of $28 million in 2003 included a $36 million adjustment to
the carrying value of long-term investments in affordable housing
partnerships, $15 million in expenses from currency hedging related to the
financing of international



activities, partially offset by $16 million of
gains on the sales of land and buildings, a $5 million one-time payment for
the transfer of the Godiva Chocolatier ice cream license, and other net
income of $2 million. The sales of land and buildings relate to the closure
of a dry soup plant in Ireland ($8 million) and an Arnott’s plant in
Melbourne, Australia ($8 million).

Other expenses of $99 million in 2002 included $78 million in amortization
expense, $16 million in adjustments to the carrying value of long-term
investments in affordable housing partnerships, $9 million in expenses from
currency hedging related to the financing of international activities,
partially offset by other net income of $4 million. Approximately $70 million
of amortization was eliminated from 2002 results on a pro forma basis upon
adoption of SFAS No. 142 in 2003. See also Note 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In 2003, costs related to stock-based incentive compensation and deferred
compensation were reclassified from Other expenses to reflect the costs by
function. The prior period was adjusted to conform to the current
presentation.

Operating Earnings

Segment operating earnings declined 3% in 2004 from 2003.
The restructuring charges accounted for 2% of the decline.

As previously noted, operating segment results for 2002 have been restated to
reflect the pro forma impact of SFAS No. 142. Consequently, amortization
expense of $70 million was eliminated from 2002 operating earnings. Segment
operating earnings, on a comparable basis, increased 5% in 2003 from 2002.

Contributions to earnings by segment include the effect of a pre-tax
fourth quarter 2004 restructuring charge of $32 million as follows:
North America Soup and Away From Home — $7 million, North America Sauces
and Beverages — $3 million, Biscuits and Confectionery —
$12 million, International Soup and Sauces — $9 million and Corporate —
$1 million.

Earnings from North America Soup and Away From Home declined 5% in 2004 from
2003. The results included restructuring charges of $7 million, which
negatively impacted earnings by 1 percentage point. Earnings were negatively
impacted by costs associated with quality improvements, higher inflation and
trade promotion, and product mix. These factors were partially offset by an
increase in sales and productivity improvements.

Earnings from North America Soup and Away From Home in 2003 were even with
2002 earnings. The increase in sales was offset by a decline in gross margin
due to quality improvements, packaging improvements and product mix. In
addition, costs increased due to shelving initiatives and system upgrades.

Earnings from North America Sauces and Beverages decreased 7% in 2004 from
2003. The results included restructuring charges of $3 million, which
negatively impacted earnings by 1 percentage point. The earnings decline also
reflected higher costs associated with new product introductions and
inflation, partially offset by productivity improvements and lower marketing
expenses.

Earnings from North America Sauces and Beverages increased 12% in 2003 from
2002 primarily due to the increase in sales of

Pace, V8 Splash

and

Prego

brand products, and an improvement in gross margin.

Earnings from Biscuits and Confectionery increased 2% in 2004 versus 2003.
The results included restructuring charges of $12 million, which negatively
impacted earnings by 6 percentage points. Currency added 8 percentage points
of growth. Earnings growth at Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s, and Godiva was
offset by a decline in the Australian Snackfoods business.

Earnings from Biscuits and Confectionery increased 14% in 2003 compared to
2002. Favorable currency translation accounted for approximately 4 percentage
points of the increase. Operating earnings in 2003 were impacted by
approximately $10 million of transitional expenses related to the closure of
the Pepperidge Farm bakery in Norwalk, Connecticut and startup of the new
bakery in Bloomfield, Connecticut. Earnings in 2003 benefited from a
$5 million payment to Godiva Chocolatier for the transfer of an ice cream
license. Earnings from Arnott’s were impacted by an $8 million gain on sale
of the closed facility in Melbourne. This gain was completely offset by
start-up costs related to the Australian manufacturing reconfiguration and
costs related to the integration of the Snack Foods acquisition. Operating
earnings in 2002 included $20 million of costs associated with the Australian
manufacturing reconfiguration compared to $1 million in 2003.

Earnings from International Soup and Sauces increased 5% in 2004. Favorable
currency translation accounted for approximately 11 percentage points of the
increase, partially offset by restructuring charges of $9 million
(approximately 7 percentage points).



The 7% increase in 2003 earnings from International Soup and Sauces was
primarily due to favorable currency translation, partially offset by
$8 million of costs associated with the discontinuance in 2004 of certain
co-packing contracts in Europe. Earnings during 2003 were impacted by costs
associated with the closure of a dry soup plant in Ireland, offset by a gain
on the sale of the closed facility.

Corporate expenses decreased in 2004 primarily due to lower adjustments
related to the carrying value of long-term investments in affordable housing
partnerships, the gain from the company’s share of a class action lawsuit
involving ingredient suppliers, the gain on sale of a manufacturing site in
California, lower expenses from currency hedging related to the financing of
international investments, partially offset by increases in costs associated
with ongoing litigation.

Corporate expenses increased in 2003 primarily due to adjustments recorded to
the carrying value of long-term investments in affordable housing
partnerships and legal expenses related to ongoing litigation, partially
offset by lower stock-related compensation costs.

Nonoperating Items

Interest expense declined 6% in 2004 from 2003 primarily
due to lower levels of debt.

Interest expense declined 2% in 2003 from 2002 due to lower levels of debt
and lower interest rates.

The effective tax rate was 31.7% in 2004, 32.2% in 2003 and 34.2% in 2002, as
reported. The reduction in the rate from 2003 to 2004 reflects a lower U.S.
tax liability which resulted from an increase in charitable contribution
deductions and research and development credits, and the favorable resolution
of certain income tax audits. The
comparable tax rate for 2002 would be 33.3% based on a pro forma adjustment
for the adoption of SFAS No. 142. The reduction from 2002 to 2003 reflects
favorable resolution of certain state income tax audits and a reduction of
foreign tax expense.

Restructuring Program

A restructuring charge of $32 million ($22 million
after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter 2004 for severance and employee
benefit costs associated with a worldwide reduction in workforce and with the
implementation of a distribution and logistics realignment in Australia.
These programs are part of cost savings initiatives designed to improve the
company’s operating margins and asset utilization. Approximately 400
positions were eliminated under the reduction in workforce program resulting
in a restructuring charge of $23 million. The reductions represent the
elimination of layers of management, elimination of redundant positions due
to the realignment of operations in North America, and reorganization of the
U.S. sales force. Annual pre-tax savings from the reduction are expected to
be approximately $40 million beginning in 2005.

The distribution and logistics realignment in Australia represents converting
a direct store delivery system to a central warehouse system. A restructuring
charge of $9 million was recorded for this program. As a result of this
program, over 200 positions will be eliminated due to the outsourcing of the
infrastructure. Annual pre-tax benefits are expected to be approximately
$10-$15 million beginning in 2008. The cash outflows related to these
programs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s
liquidity.

A restructuring charge of $10 million ($7 million after tax) was recorded in
the fourth quarter 2001 for severance costs associated with the
reconfiguration of the manufacturing network of Arnott’s in Australia. In the
second quarter of 2002, the company recorded an additional $1 million
restructuring charge related to planned severance actions. Related costs of
approximately $1 million and $19 million ($13 million after tax) were
recorded in 2003 and 2002, respectively, as Cost of products sold, primarily
representing accelerated depreciation on assets to be taken out of service.
This program was designed to drive greater manufacturing efficiency resulting
from the closure of the Melbourne plant. Approximately 550 jobs were
eliminated due to the plant closure. In 2003, the company incurred start-up
costs associated with the transition of production. These costs were
substantially offset by a gain on the sale of the facility.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
these programs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash flows from operating activities provided $744 million in 2004,
compared to $873 million in 2003. The reduction was due to higher working
capital requirements and an increase in pension fund contributions, partially
offset by an increase in earnings. Net cash flows from operating activities
provided $873 million in 2003, compared to $1.0 billion in 2002. The 2002
cash flow benefited from a significant reduction in working capital to a low
level, which was maintained in 2003. Over the last three years, operating
cash flows totaled approximately $3  billion. This cash generating capability
provides the company with substantial financial flexibility in meeting its
operating and investing needs.

Capital expenditures were $288 million in 2004, $283 million in 2003 and
$269 million in 2002. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately
$380 million in 2005. The increase in 2004 was primarily driven by currency.
Capital expenditures in 2004 included projects to increase manufacturing
capacity for soup, beverages and

Goldfish Sandwich Snackers

crackers, as well
as investments in U.S. sales systems. The increase in 2003 was driven by the
Pepperidge Farm bakery and soup quality projects, partially offset by reduced
spending in Australia on the manufacturing reconfiguration that was
substantially completed in 2002.



Businesses acquired, as presented in the Statements of Cash Flows, primarily
represents the acquisition of certain brands from George Weston Foods Limited
in Australia in the first quarter of 2004 and the acquisitions of Snack Foods
Limited and Erin Foods in the first quarter of 2003. The purchase price
adjustment in 2002 related to the European dry soup and sauces acquisition,
completed in 2001.

In September 2003, the company issued $300 million ten-year 4.875% fixed-rate
notes. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and for
other general corporate purposes. While planning for the issuance of these
notes, the company entered into treasury lock agreements with a notional
value of $100 million that effectively fixed a portion of the interest rate
on the debt prior to issuance of the notes. These agreements were settled at
a minimal gain upon issuance of the notes, which will be amortized over the
life of the notes. In connection with this issuance, the company entered into
ten-year interest rate swaps that converted $200 million of the fixed-rate
debt to variable.

In September 2003, the company also entered into $100 million five-year
interest rate swaps that converted a portion of the 5.875% fixed-rate notes
due October 2008 to variable.

In April 2004, the company entered into a $50 million interest rate swap that
converted a portion of the 6.9% fixed-rate notes due October 2006 to
variable.

In May 2004, the company entered into a $50 million interest rate swap that
converted a portion of the 6.9% fixed-rate notes due October 2006 to
variable.

Long-term borrowings in 2003 included the issuance of $400 million of
ten-year 5% fixed-rate notes due December 2012. The proceeds were used to
retire $300 million 6.15% notes and to repay commercial paper borrowings. In
connection with this issuance, the company entered into ten-year interest
rate swaps that converted $300 million of the fixed-rate debt to variable.

In November 2002, the company terminated interest rate swap contracts with a
notional value of $250 million that converted fixed-rate debt (6.75% notes
due 2011) to variable and received $37 million. Of this amount, $3 million
represented accrued interest earned on the swap prior to the termination
date. The remainder will be amortized over the remaining life of the notes as
a reduction to interest expense.

Long-term borrowings in 2002 were the result of a series of debt issuances
throughout the year. In September 2001,
the company issued $300 million seven-year 5.875% fixed-rate notes. The
proceeds were used to repay short-term borrowings. While planning for the
issuance of these notes, the company entered into interest rate swaps with a
notional value of approximately $138 million that effectively fixed a portion
of the interest rate

on the debt prior to issuance. These contracts were
settled at a loss of approximately $4 million upon issuance of the notes.
This loss is being amortized over the life of the notes. In conjunction with
the issuance of these notes, the company also entered into a $75 million
seven-year interest rate swap that converted fixed-rate debt to variable.

In October 2001, the company issued $300 million two-year variable-rate
notes. The proceeds were also used to repay short-term borrowings. In
connection with this issuance, the company entered into a $300 million
two-year interest rate swap that converted the variable-rate debt to fixed.

In November 2001, the company redeemed $100 million 5.625% fixed-rate notes
due in September 2003. The notes were callable at par. This redemption was
financed with lower rate commercial paper.

In December 2001, the company issued an additional $200 million of its
existing 6.75% fixed-rate notes due February 2011, originally issued in
February 2001. These additional notes were priced at a premium to reflect
market conditions. The proceeds were used to repay short-term borrowings.

In January 2002, the company repaid $300 million of variable-rate notes due
December 2003. The notes were repaid with lower cost short-term borrowings.

In March 2002, the company issued $300 million five-year 5.50% fixed-rate
notes. The proceeds were used to repay $228 million variable-rate notes due
in December 2003 and short-term borrowings. In connection with this issuance,
the company entered into a five-year interest rate swap that converted
$100 million of the fixed-rate debt to variable.

In June 2002, the company filed a $1 billion shelf registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to use for future offerings of
debt securities. Under the registration statement, the company may issue debt
securities from time to time, depending on market conditions. The company
intends to use the proceeds to repay short-term debt, to reduce or retire
other indebtedness or for other general corporate purposes. As of August 1,
2004, the company had $300 million available for issuance under this
registration statement.

Dividend payments were $259 million in 2004 and 2003. Annual dividends
declared in 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $0.63 per share. The 2004 fourth
quarter rate was $0.1575 per share.

The company repurchased 2 million shares at a cost of $56 million during
2004, compared to 1 million shares at a cost of $24 million during 2003 and
200,000 shares at a cost of $5 million in 2002. The company expects to
repurchase sufficient shares over time to offset the impact of dilution from
shares issued under the company’s stock compensation plans. See “Market For



Registrant’s Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and Issuer Purchases
of Equity Securities” for more information.

At August 1, 2004, the company had $810 million of notes payable due within
one year and $34 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the
company. The company maintained $1.8 billion of committed revolving credit
facilities, which were unused at August 1, 2004, except for $34 million of
standby letters of credit. Both of these facilities were replaced in
September 2004. As part of the replacement, the company entered into a
$500 million committed 364-day revolving credit facility, which replaced the
existing $900 million 364-day facility that matured in September 2004. The
364-day revolving credit facility contains a one-year term-out feature. The
company also entered into a $1 billion revolving credit facility that matures
in September 2009, which replaced the existing $900 million revolving credit
facility that was scheduled to mature in September 2006. These agreements
support the company’s commercial paper program.

The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its revolving
credit facilities and debt securities.

The company believes that foreseeable liquidity, including the resolution of
the contingencies described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, and capital resource requirements are expected to be met through
anticipated cash flows from operations, management of working capital,
long-term borrowings under its shelf registration, and short-term borrowings,
including commercial paper. The company believes that its sources of
financing are adequate to meet its future liquidity and capital resource
requirements. The cost and terms of any future financing arrangements depend
on the market conditions and the company’s financial position at that time.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the company’s
obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual
obligations. For additional information on debt, see Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases are primarily entered
into for warehouse and office facilities, retail store space, and certain
equipment. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long-term
purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies,
machinery, equipment and services. These commitments are not expected to have
a material impact on liquidity. Other long-term liabilities primarily
represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations and
postemployment benefits. For additional information on other long-term
liabilities, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

a gain on fair-value interest rate swaps. For additional information on
debt obligations, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Interest payments for notes payable, long-term debt and derivative
instruments are calculated as follows. For notes payable, interest is
based on par values and coupon rates of contractually obligated
issuances at fiscal year end. For long-term debt, interest is based on
principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at fiscal year end. Interest on
fixed-rate derivative instruments is based on notional amounts and fixed
interest rates contractually obligated at fiscal year end. Interest on
variable-rate derivative instruments is based on notional amounts
contractually obligated at fiscal year end and weighted-average rates
estimated over the instrument’s life using forward interest rates plus
applicable spreads.


Represents other long-term liabilities, excluding deferred taxes and
minority interest. This table does not include postretirement medical
benefits or payments related to pension plans. The company made a
$35 million voluntary contribution to a U.S. plan subsequent to August
1, 2004.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments

The company guarantees
approximately 1,300 bank loans to Pepperidge Farm independent sales
distributors by third party financial institutions used to purchase
distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments the
company could be required to make under the guarantees is approximately
$95 million. The company’s guarantees are indirectly secured by the
distribution routes. The company does not believe that it is probable that it
will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the
bank loans guaranteed. See also Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on off-balance sheet arrangements.

Inflation

Inflation during recent years has not had a significant effect on the
company. The company mitigates the effects of inflation by pricing and
aggressively pursuing cost productivity initiatives, including global
procurement strategies, and making capital investments that improve the
efficiency of operations.

Market Risk Sensitivity

The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in
commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In
addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain
employee compensation



obligations. The company manages its exposure to
changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and
fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its
variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International
operations, which accounted for approximately 36% of 2004 net sales, are
concentrated principally in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the United
Kingdom. The company manages its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in
various foreign currencies and utilizing cross-currency swaps and forward
contracts. Swaps and forward contracts are entered into for periods
consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions
independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for
speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various
short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of
raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The
company may also

enter into commodity futures contracts, as considered
appropriate, to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities
such as corn, cocoa, soybean meal, soybean oil and wheat. At August 1, 2004
and August 3, 2003, the notional values and unrealized gains or losses on
commodity futures contracts held by the company were not material.

The information below summarizes the company’s market risks associated with
debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of August 1,
2004. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market
prices. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with
Notes 16 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The table below presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by
fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations. Variable interest rates
disclosed represent the weighted-average rates of the portfolio at the period
end. Notional amounts and related interest rates of interest rate swaps are
presented by fiscal year of maturity. For the swaps, variable rates are the
weighted-average forward rates for the term of each contract.

As of August 3, 2003, fixed-rate debt of approximately $2.6 billion with an
average interest rate of 6.17% and variable-rate debt of approximately
$1 billion with an average interest rate of 2.07% were outstanding. As of
August 3, 2003, the company had also swapped $475 million of fixed-rate debt
to variable. The average rate received on these swaps was 5.24% and the
average rate paid was estimated to be 4.89% over the remaining life of the
swaps. Additionally, the company had swapped $300 million of floating-rate
debt to fixed. The swap matured in 2004.



The company is exposed to foreign exchange risk related to its international
operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt and net
investments in subsidiaries.

The table below summarizes the cross-currency swaps outstanding as of August
1, 2004, which hedge such exposures. The notional amount of each currency and

The cross-currency swap contracts outstanding at August 3, 2003 represented
two pay fixed SEK/receive fixed USD swaps with notional values of $31 million
and $47 million, a pay fixed EUR/receive fixed USD swap with a notional value
of $200 million, and a pay fixed GBP/receive fixed USD swap with a notional
value of $200 million. The aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was
$(97) million as of August 3, 2003.

The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of
transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain
subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. The company utilizes foreign
exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The
following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding
and the related weighted-average contract exchange rates as of August 1,

The company had an additional $8 million in a number of smaller contracts to
purchase or sell various other currencies, such as the Australian dollar,
British pound, Canadian dollar, euro, New Zealand dollar and Swiss franc as
of August 1, 2004. The aggregate fair value of all contracts was $2 million
as of August 1, 2004. Total forward exchange contracts outstanding as of
August 3, 2003 were $750 million with a fair value of $4 million.

The company had swap contracts outstanding as of August 1, 2004, which hedge
a portion of exposures relating to certain employee compensation liabilities
linked to the total return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index or to the total
return of the company’s capital stock. Under these contracts, the company
pays variable interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index total return or the total return on company
capital stock. The notional value of the contracts that are linked to the
return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was $21 million at August 1, 2004
and $10 million at August 3, 2003. The average forward interest rate
applicable to the contract, which expires in 2005, was 1.81% at
August 1, 2004. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the
total return on company capital stock was $13 million at August 1, 2004 and
$11 million at August 3, 2003. The average forward
interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2005, was 2.22%
at August 1, 2004. The fair value of these contracts was a $1 million gain at
both August 1, 2004 and August 3, 2003.

The company’s utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk
exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the
portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of
operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and
foreign currency, and the company’s acquisition and divestiture activities.



Significant Accounting Estimates

The consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results
could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting
policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex
judgments, estimates and assumptions:

Trade and consumer promotion program

The company offers various sales
incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as cooperative
advertising programs, feature price discounts, in-store display incentives
and coupons. The recognition of the costs for these programs, which are
classified as a reduction of revenue, involves use of judgment related to
performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical
experience and other factors. Actual expenses may differ if the level of
redemption rates and performance vary from estimates.

Valuation of long-lived assets

Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and
intangibles, are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in
circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not
be recoverable. Discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess
nonamortizable intangible asset impairment, while undiscounted cash flow
analyses are used to assess other long-lived asset impairment. The estimates
of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based
upon assumptions about expected future operating performance. Assumptions
used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. The actual
cash flows could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in
business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.

Pension and postretirement medical benefits

The company provides certain
pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining
the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial
assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets,
compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates.
Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine
expense. Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are
generally accumulated and amortized over future periods.

The discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal year-end
measurement date based on high-quality, long-term debt securities. The estimated return on plan assets is a long-term
assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance,
considering the company’s current and projected

investment mix. Within any
given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual
return and the estimated long-term return on plan assets. The value of plan
assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a
calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual
fair value of assets and the expected calculated method. Gains and losses
resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are
determined at each measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of
the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized into
earnings in the following year.

When the fair value of pension plan assets is less than the accumulated
benefit obligation, accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States require a company to recognize an additional minimal liability. This
adjustment is recorded in Other comprehensive income within Shareowners’
Equity. As of August 1, 2004 and August 3, 2003, Shareowners’ Equity includes
a minimum liability, net of tax, of $196 million and $210 million,
respectively.

Net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense was $65 million in
2004, $43 million in 2003 and $8 million in 2002. The increase in 2004 was
primarily due to a lower discount rate and a reduction in the expected return
on assets, partially offset by the returns associated with a $50 million
voluntary contribution to a U.S. plan. Significant weighted-average
assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows:

Estimated sensitivities to the net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50
basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by
approximately $10 million; a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return
on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $9 million. A
one percentage point change in assumed health care costs would increase
service and interest cost by approximately $2 million.

Although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the U.S. plans in
2004, the company made a $50 million contribution to a U.S. plan based on
expected future funding requirements. Contributions to international plans
were $15 million. In 2003, there were no contributions to the U.S. plans and
contributions to international plans were $19 million. Subsequent to August
1, 2004, the company made a $35 million voluntary contribution to a U.S. plan
in anticipation of future funding requirements.

See also Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on pension and postretirement medical expenses.



Income taxes

The effective tax rate reflects management’s estimate of the
ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. In addition, valuation
allowances are established for deferred tax assets where the amount of
expected future taxable income from operations does not support the
realization of the asset.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

The company adopted SFAS No.144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets” on July 29, 2002. This standard was effective for the
company on a prospective basis. This standard addresses financial accounting
and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This
standard supersedes SFAS No.121 “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of” and the accounting and
reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.30
“Reporting the Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions” for the disposal of a segment of a business.
Long-lived assets are tested for impairment if certain triggers occur. The
adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the financial
statements.

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
SFAS No.146 “Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities.” The provisions of
this standard apply to disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the financial
statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.148 “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.” This standard amends the
transition and disclosure requirements of SFAS No.123 “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.” The required disclosures are included in Note 1 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. As permitted by SFAS No.148, the
company accounts for stock option grants and restricted stock awards in
accordance with APB Opinion No.25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
and related Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been
recognized for stock options since all options granted had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the grant date.

In November 2002, FASB Interpretation No.45 (FIN 45) “Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others” was issued. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements
relating to a guarantor’s accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of
certain types of guarantees. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a
guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the
obligation it assumes under that guarantee. The initial recognition and
measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after

December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions are
included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an Interpretation of ARB 51.” This Interpretation addresses
consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities
(VIEs). The Interpretation as amended is effective immediately for all
enterprises with interests in VIEs created after January 31,
2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised version of FIN 46 (FIN
46R), which clarified the provisions of FIN 46 by addressing implementation
issues. FIN 46R must be applied to all entities subject to the Interpretation
as of the first interim quarter ending after March 15, 2004. The company has
investments of approximately $150 million as of August 1, 2004 consisting of
limited partnership interests in affordable housing partnership funds. The
company’s ownership ranges from approximately 12% to 19%. The company
evaluated the nature of these investments, which were in existence before
January 31, 2003, against the provisions of the guidance and determined that
such investments do not need to be consolidated in the financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.150 “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No.150
changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that, under previous
guidance, could be classified as equity or “mezzanine” equity, by now
requiring those instruments to be classified as liabilities (or assets in
some circumstances) in the statement of financial position. Further,
SFAS No.150 requires disclosure regarding the terms of those instruments and
settlement alternatives. The guidance in SFAS No.150 is generally effective
for all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and
is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this standard did not impact the
financial statements.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduced a
prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D and a federal subsidy to
sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a benefit that is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In accordance with FASB
Staff Position (FSP) FAS 106-1, the company elected in January to defer
recognizing the effects of the Act on accounting for postretirement health
care plans until the FASB guidance was finalized.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106-2, which provides accounting
guidance to sponsors of postretirement health care plans that are impacted by
the Act. The FSP is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after
June 15, 2004. Although detailed regulations necessary to implement the Act
have not yet been finalized, the company believes that certain



drug benefits
offered under postretirement health care plans will qualify for the subsidy
under Medicare Part D. The effects of the subsidy were factored into the 2004
annual year-end valuation. The reduction in the benefit obligation
attributable to past service cost was approximately $32 million and has been
reflected as an actuarial gain. The reduction in benefit cost for 2005
related to the Act is approximately $5 million.

Recent Developments

As part of the initiatives announced by the company on June 24, 2004, the
company will implement a new SAP enterprise-resource planning system in North
America. The project is planned for the next three years and is expected to
cost approximately $125 million.

Earnings Outlook

On September 13, 2004, the company issued a press release announcing results
for 2004 and commented on the outlook for earnings per share for 2005.

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results

This Report contains “forward-looking” statements that reflect the company’s
current expectations regarding future results of operations, economic
performance, financial condition and achievements of the company. The company
tries, wherever possible, to identify these forward-looking statements by
using words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “will” and
similar expressions. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not
relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements reflect the
company’s current plans and expectations and are based on information
currently available to it. They rely on a number of assumptions regarding
future events and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are
inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.

The company wishes to caution the reader that the following important factors
and those important factors described elsewhere in the commentary, or in the
Securities and Exchange Commission filings of the company, could affect the
company’s actual results and could cause such results to vary materially from
those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of,
the company:

•

the impact of strong competitive response to the company’s efforts to leverage its brand power with product innovation,
promotional programs and new advertising, and of changes in consumer demand for the company’s products;

•

the risks in the marketplace associated with trade and consumer acceptance of product improvements, shelving
initiatives, and new product introductions;

This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to
highlight important factors that may impact the company’s outlook. The

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)


Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Significant
intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts
in prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the
current presentation.

The company’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest July 31. There were 52
weeks in 2004, 53 weeks in 2003 and 52 weeks in 2002.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues are recognized when the earnings process is
complete. This occurs when products are shipped in accordance with terms of
agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to customers, collection is
probable and pricing is fixed or determinable.

Beginning in 2002, the company adopted the consensus reached by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) on Issue No. 01-09 “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to
a Customer or Reseller of the Vendor’s Products.” Under this consensus, the
EITF concluded that certain consumer and trade sales promotion expenses,
such as coupon redemption costs, cooperative advertising programs, new
product introduction fees, feature price discounts and in-store display
incentives, should be classified as a reduction of sales rather than as
marketing expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with
a maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.

Inventories

Substantially all U.S. inventories are priced at the lower of
cost or market, with cost determined by the last in, first out (LIFO)
method. Other inventories are priced at the lower of average cost or market.

Plant Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Plant assets are stated at
historical cost. Alterations and major overhauls, which extend the lives or
increase the capacity of plant assets, are capitalized. Ordinary repairs and
maintenance are charged to operating costs. Depreciation provided in Costs
and expenses is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Buildings and machinery and equipment are
depreciated over periods not exceeding 45 years and 15 years, respectively.

The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” on
July 29, 2002. This standard was effective for the company on a prospective
basis. This standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets such as property, plants,
equipment and amortized intangibles. This standard supersedes SFAS No. 121
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of” and the accounting and reporting provisions of
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 30 “Reporting the Results of
Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions”
for the disposal of a segment of a business. Long-lived assets are tested
for impairment if certain triggers occur. The adoption of this standard did
not have a material impact on the financial statements.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The company uses derivative financial
instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodities and
equity-linked employee benefit obligations. All derivatives are recognized
on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
are recorded in earnings or other comprehensive income, based on whether the
instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type
of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in
other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period in
which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item. The ineffective
portion of all hedges is recognized in earnings in the current period. See
Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation–Transition and Disclosure.” This
standard amends the transition and disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” As permitted by SFAS No. 148, the
company accounts for stock option grants and restricted stock awards in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
and related Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been
recognized for stock options since all options granted had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the grant date.
Restricted stock awards are expensed. See also Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table illustrates the
effect on net earnings and earnings per share if the company had applied



the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee
compensation.

Use of Estimates

Generally accepted accounting principles require management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect assets and liabilities,
contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when
it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 146 “Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities.” The provisions of
this standard apply to disposal activities initiated after December 31,
2002. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the
financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46)
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB 51.”
This Interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of
certain variable interest entities (VIEs). The Interpretation as amended is
effective immediately for all enterprises with interests in VIEs created
after January 31, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised version
of FIN 46 (FIN 46R), which clarified the provisions of FIN 46 by addressing
implementation issues. FIN 46R must be applied to all entities subject to
the Interpretation as of the first interim quarter ending after March 15,
2004. The company has investments of approximately $150 as of August 1, 2004
consisting of limited partnership interests in affordable housing
partnership funds. The company’s ownership ranges from approximately 12% to
19%. The company evaluated the nature of these investments, which were in
existence before January 31, 2003, against the provisions of the guidance
and determined that such investments do not need to be consolidated in the
financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150 “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.”
SFAS No. 150 changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that,
under previous guidance, could be classified as equity or “mezzanine”
equity, by now requiring those instruments to be classified as liabilities
(or assets in some circumstances) in the statement of financial position.
Further, SFAS No. 150 requires disclosure regarding the terms of those
instruments and settlement alternatives. The guidance in SFAS No. 150 is
generally effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003 and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this standard
did not impact the financial statements.

In December  2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduced
a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D and a
federal subsidy to sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a
benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In
accordance with FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 106-1, the company elected in
January to defer recognizing the effects of the Act on accounting for
postretirement health care plans until the FASB guidance was finalized.



In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106-2, which provides accounting
guidance to sponsors of postretirement health care plans that are impacted
by the Act. The FSP is effective for interim or annual periods beginning
after June 15, 2004. Although detailed regulations necessary to implement
the Act have not yet been finalized, the company believes that certain drug
benefits offered under postretirement health care plans will qualify for the
subsidy under Medicare Part D. The effects of the subsidy were factored into
the 2004 annual year-end valuation. The reduction in the benefit obligation
attributable to past service cost was approximately $32 and has been
reflected as an actuarial gain. The reduction in benefit cost for 2005
related to the Act is approximately $5.


Comprehensive Income

Total comprehensive income is comprised of net earnings, net foreign
currency translation adjustments, minimum pension liability adjustments (see
Note 9), and net unrealized gains and losses on cash-flow hedges. Total
comprehensive income for the twelve months ended August 1, 2004, August 3,
2003 and July 28, 2002 was $759, $760 and $368, respectively.

The components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, as reflected in the
Statements of Shareowners’ Equity (Deficit), consisted of the following:

Includes a tax benefit of $111 in 2004 and $120 in 2003.


Goodwill and Intangible Assets

On
July 29, 2002, the company adopted SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” Under
this standard, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
are no longer amortized, but rather are to be tested at least annually for
impairment. Intangible assets with finite lives should continue to be
amortized over the estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No.144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets.” In connection with the adoption of SFAS
No. 142, the
company was required to perform an impairment assessment on all goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 29, 2002. The assessment of
the indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison between the
fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset. To the extent the
carrying

value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The
assessment of goodwill is a two-step process in which the first step
identifies impairment by requiring a comparison of the fair value of each
reporting unit to the carrying value, including goodwill allocated to the
unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered
to be impaired. The amount of impairment is measured in a second step as the
difference between the carrying value of goodwill and the “implied” fair
value of goodwill, which is determined by calculating goodwill as if the
reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business
combination. Fair values were determined using discounted cash flow
analyses. As a result of this evaluation, the company recorded a non-cash
after-tax charge of $31 (net of a $17 tax benefit), or $.08 per share in
2003, for impaired goodwill associated with the Stockpot business, a food
service business acquired in August 1998. Stockpot is a reporting unit in
the North America Soup and Away From Home segment. This non-cash charge was
recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The
impairment of Stockpot goodwill was the result of a reduction in actual
sales attained and forecasted future sales growth relative to projections
made at the time of the acquisition.

The
provisions of SFAS No. 142 were adopted on a prospective basis and prior
year results are not restated. The following tables present a reconciliation
of earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change, adjusted to
exclude amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets:

Transfers between geographic areas are recorded at cost plus markup or at
market. Identifiable assets are those assets, including goodwill, which are
identified with the operations in each geographic region. The restructuring
charge of $32 in 2004 was allocated to the geographic regions as follows:
United States — $12, Europe — $9, Australia/Asia Pacific — $10, and Other
countries — $1. The restructuring charge in 2002 was allocated to
Australia/Asia Pacific.


Restructuring Program

A restructuring charge of $32 ($22 after tax) was recorded in the fourth
quarter 2004 for severance and employee benefit costs associated with a
worldwide reduction in workforce and with the implementation of a
distribution and logistics realignment in Australia. These programs are part
of cost savings initiatives designed to improve the company’s operating
margins and asset utilization. Approximately 400 positions were eliminated
under the reduction in workforce program resulting in a restructuring charge
of $23. The reductions represent the elimination of layers of management,
elimination of redundant positions due to the



realignment of operations in
North America, and reorganization of the U.S. sales force. The majority of
the terminations occurred in the fourth quarter.

The distribution and logistics realignment in Australia represents converting
a direct store delivery system to a central warehouse system. As a result of
this program, over 200 positions will be eliminated due to the outsourcing of
the infrastructure. A restructuring charge of $9 was recorded for this
program. The majority of the terminations will occur in 2005.

A restructuring charge of $10 ($7 after tax) was recorded in the fourth
quarter 2001 for severance costs associated with the reconfiguration of the
manufacturing network of Arnott’s in Australia. In the second quarter 2002,
the company recorded an additional $1 restructuring charge related to planned
severance actions. Related costs of approximately $1 in 2003 and $19 ($13
after tax) in 2002 were recorded as Cost of products sold, primarily
representing accelerated depreciation on assets to be taken out of service.
This program was designed to drive greater manufacturing efficiency resulting
from the closure of the Melbourne plant. Approximately 550 jobs were
eliminated due to the plant closure.

Acquisitions

In the first quarter 2004, the company acquired certain Australian chocolate
biscuit brands for approximately $9. These brands are included in the
Biscuits and Confectionery segment.

In the first quarter 2003, the company acquired two businesses for cash
consideration of approximately $170 and
assumed debt of approximately $20. The company acquired Snack Foods Limited,
a leader in the Australian salty snack category, and Erin Foods, the number
two dry soup manufacturer in Ireland. Snack Foods Limited is included in the
Biscuits and Confectionery segment. Erin Foods is included in the
International Soup and Sauces segment. The businesses have annual sales of
approximately $160. The pro forma impact on net earnings or earnings per
share for the prior periods would not have been material.


Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

Substantially all of the company’s U.S. and certain non-U.S.
employees are covered by noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. In
1999, the company implemented significant amendments to certain U.S. plans.
Under a new formula, retirement benefits are determined based on percentages
of annual pay and age. To minimize the impact of converting to the new
formula, service and earnings credit will continue to accrue for active
employees participating in the plans under the formula prior to the
amendments through the year 2014. Employees will receive the benefit from
either the new or old formula, whichever is higher. Benefits become vested
upon the completion of five years of service. Benefits are paid from funds
previously provided to trustees and insurance companies or are paid directly
by the company from general funds. Plan assets consist primarily of
investments in equities, fixed income securities, and real estate.

Postretirement Benefits

The company provides postretirement benefits
including health care and life insurance to substantially all retired U.S.
employees and their dependents. In 1999, changes were made to the
postretirement benefits offered to certain U.S. employees. Participants who
were not receiving postretirement benefits as of May 1, 1999 will no longer
be eligible to receive such benefits in the future, but the company will
provide



access to health care coverage for non-eligible future retirees on a
group basis. Costs will be paid by the participants. To preserve the economic
benefits for employees near retirement, participants who were at least age 55
and had at least 10 years of continuous service remain eligible for
postretirement benefits.

The company uses the fiscal year end as the measurement date for the benefit
plans.

accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension
plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
$1,340, $1,204, and $1,046, respectively, as of August 1, 2004 and $1,256,
$1,131, and $929, respectively, as of August 3, 2003.

The current portion of nonpension postretirement benefits included in Accrued

The long-term rate of return on assets for the company’s global plans is a
weighted average of the long-term rates of return selected for the various
countries where the company has funded pension plans. These rates of return
are set annually and are based upon the long-term historical investment
performance of the plans and an estimate of future long-term investment
returns for the current asset allocation.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduced a
prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D and a federal subsidy to
sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a benefit that is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The effects of the Act were
reflected in the 2004 valuation. See also Note 1 to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

Obligations related to non-U.S. postretirement benefit plans are not
significant since these benefits are generally provided through
government-sponsored plans.

The fundamental goal underlying the pension plans’ investment policy is to
ensure that the assets of the plans are invested in a prudent manner to meet
the obligations of the plans as these obligations come due. Investment
practices must comply with applicable laws and regulations.

The company’s investment strategy is based on an expectation that equity
securities will outperform debt securities over the long term. Accordingly,
in order to maximize the return on assets, a majority of assets are invested
in equities. Additional asset classes with dissimilar expected rates of
return, return volatility, and correlations of returns are utilized to reduce
risk by providing diversification relative to equities. Investments within
each asset class are also diversified to further reduce the impact of losses
in single investments. The use of derivative instruments is permitted where
appropriate and necessary to achieve overall investment policy objectives and
asset class targets.

The company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and
appropriate benchmarks for each significant asset class to obtain a prudent
balance between return and risk. The interaction between plan assets and
benefit obligations is periodically studied to assist in the establishment of
strategic asset allocation targets.

The company made a voluntary contribution of $35 to a U.S. pension plan
subsequent to August 1, 2004. The company is not required to make additional
contributions to the U.S. plans in 2005. Contributions to non-U.S. plans are
expected to be $20 in 2005.



Savings Plan

The company sponsors employee savings plans which cover
substantially all U.S. employees. After one year of continuous service, the
company historically matched 50% of employee contributions up to 5% of
compensation. Effective January 1, 2004, the company increased the amount of
matching contribution from 50% to 60% of the employee’s contributions.
Amounts charged to Costs and expenses were $14 in 2004, $11 in 2003 and $13
in 2002.

2009 and $75 may be carried forward indefinitely. The current statutory tax
rates in these countries range from 13% to 46%.

U.S. income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of
non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $514, which are deemed to be

The deferred compensation plan is an unfunded plan maintained for the
purpose of providing the company’s directors and certain of its executives
the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation. All forms of
compensation contributed to the deferred compensation plan are accounted for
in accordance with the underlying program. Contributions are credited to an
investment account in the participant’s name, although no funds are actually
contributed to the investment account and no investment choices are actually
purchased. Four investment choices are available, including: (1) a book
account which tracks the total return on company stock; (2) a book account
that tracks performance of Fidelity’s Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund; (3) a
book account which tracks the performance of Fidelity’s Puritan Fund and;
(4) a book account that credits interest based on the Wall Street Journal
indexed prime rate. Participants can reallocate investments daily and are
entitled to the gains and losses on investment funds. The company recognizes
an amount in the Statements of Earnings for the market
appreciation/depreciation of each fund, as appropriate.


Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes
receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate fair value. The
fair values of long-term debt, as indicated in Note 16, and derivative
financial instruments are based on quoted market prices.

In 2001, the company adopted SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” as amended by SFAS No. 138 and
SFAS No. 149. The standard requires that all derivative instruments be
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for
designation and effectiveness of the hedging relationships.

The company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to enhance its
ability to manage risk, including interest rate, foreign currency, commodity
and certain equity-linked employee compensation exposures that exist as part
of ongoing business

operations. Derivative instruments are entered into for
periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute
positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into
contracts for speculative purposes, nor is it a party to any leveraged
derivative instrument.

The company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
counterparties on derivative contracts. The company minimizes its credit
risk on these transactions by dealing only with leading, credit-worthy
financial institutions having long-term credit ratings of “A” or better and,
therefore, does not anticipate nonperformance. In addition, the contracts
are distributed among several financial institutions, thus minimizing credit
risk concentration.

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. On the
date the derivative contract is entered into, the company designates the
derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or
liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair-value hedge), (2) a
hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be
received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow
hedge), (3) a foreign-currency fair-value or cash-flow hedge
(foreign-currency hedge), or (4) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation. Some derivatives may also be considered natural hedging
instruments (changes in fair value are recognized to act as economic offsets
to changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item and do not qualify
for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133).

Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the loss or gain
on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk
(including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in current
period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a cash-flow hedge are recorded
in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the
variability of cash flows. Changes in the fair value of a foreign-currency
hedge are recorded in either current period earnings or other comprehensive
income, depending on whether the hedge transaction is a fair-value hedge
(e.g., a hedge of a firm commitment that is to be settled in foreign
currency) or a cash-flow hedge (e.g., a hedge of a
foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction). If, however, a
derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation,
its changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded
in the cumulative translation adjustments account within Shareowners’ equity
(deficit).

The company finances a portion of its operations through debt instruments
primarily consisting of commercial paper, notes, debentures and bank loans.
The company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to minimize worldwide
financing costs and to achieve a targeted ratio of variable-rate
versus fixed-rate debt.



In September 2003, the company entered into ten-year interest rate swaps
that converted $200 of the 4.875% fixed-rate notes issued during that month
to variable. The company also entered into $100 five-year interest rate
swaps that converted a portion of the 5.875% fixed-rate notes due October
2008 to variable.

In April 2004, the company entered into a $50 interest rate swap that
converted a portion of the 6.9% fixed-rate notes due October 2006 to
variable.

In May 2004, the company entered into a $50 interest rate swap that
converted a portion of the 6.9% fixed-rate notes due October 2006 to
variable.

In November 2002, the company terminated interest rate swap contracts with a
notional value of $250 that converted fixed-rate debt (6.75% notes due 2011)
to variable and received $37. Of this amount, $3 represented accrued
interest earned on the swap prior to the termination date. The remainder of
$34 is being amortized over the remaining life of the notes as a reduction
to interest expense. The company also entered into ten-year interest rate
swaps that converted $300 of ten-year 5% fixed-rate notes issued in November
2002 to variable.

In 2002, the company entered into interest rate swaps that converted
fixed-rate debt (5.50% notes due in 2007 and 5.875% notes due in 2009) to
variable. Fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps are accounted for as
fair-value hedges. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in
earnings as adjustments to interest expense, offsetting gains and losses on
the hedged item. The notional amount of fair-value interest rate swaps was
$875 and $475 at August 1, 2004 and August 3, 2003, respectively. The swaps
had a minimal fair value at August 1, 2004 and a fair value of $2 at August
3, 2003.

In 2002, the company also entered into interest rate swaps with a notional
value of $300 that converted variable-rate debt to fixed. The swaps matured
in 2004.

In anticipation of the $300 seven-year notes issued in September 2001, the
company entered into forward-starting interest rate swap contracts with a
notional value of $138. Upon issuance of the notes, the contracts were
settled at a loss of approximately $4. This loss was recorded in other
comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized to interest expense over
the life of the notes.

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of
transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain
subsidiaries, including subsidiary financing transactions. The company
utilizes foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts, options and
cross-currency swaps in order to manage the volatility associated with
foreign currency purchases and certain intercompany transactions in the
normal course of business.

Qualifying foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts are
accounted for as cash-flow hedges when the hedged item is a forecasted
transaction, or when future cash flows related to a recognized asset or
liability are expected to be received or paid. The effective portion of the
changes in fair value on these instruments is recorded in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into the Statements of
Earnings on the same line item and in the same period or periods in which
the hedged transaction affects earnings. The assessment of effectiveness for
contracts is based on changes in spot rates. The fair value of these
instruments was $(147) at August 1, 2004.

Qualifying foreign exchange forward contracts are accounted for as
fair-value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability or
firm commitment. The fair-value of such contracts was not material at August
1, 2004.

The company also enters into certain foreign exchange forward contracts and
variable-to-variable cross-currency swap contracts that are not designated
as accounting hedges. These instruments are primarily intended to reduce
volatility of certain intercompany financing transactions. Gains and losses
on derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are typically recorded in
Other expenses/(income), as an offset to gains (losses) on the underlying
transactions. The fair value of these instruments was $(8) at August 1,
2004.

Foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of less than
eighteen months. Principal currencies include the Australian dollar, British
pound, Canadian dollar, euro, Japanese yen and Swedish krona.

As of August 1, 2004, the accumulated derivative net loss in other
comprehensive income for cash-flow hedges, including the foreign exchange
forward and cross-currency contracts, forward-starting swap contracts and
treasury lock agreements was $1, net of tax. As of August 3, 2003 the
accumulated derivative net loss in other comprehensive income for cash-flow
hedges, including the cross-currency swaps, variable-to-fixed interest rate
swaps and forward-starting swap contracts was $5, net of tax.
Reclassifications from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into
the Statements of Earnings during the period ended August 1, 2004 were not
material. There were no discontinued cash-flow hedges during the year. At
August 1, 2004, the maximum maturity date of any cash-flow hedge was
approximately nine years.

Other disclosures related to hedge ineffectiveness, gains (losses) excluded
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, gains (losses) arising from
effective hedges of net investments, gains (losses) resulting from the
discontinuance of hedge accounting and reclassifications from other
comprehensive income to earnings have been omitted due to the insignificance
of these amounts.



The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various
short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of
raw materials, including certain commodities
and agricultural products. The company may also enter into commodity futures
contracts, as considered appropriate, to reduce the volatility of price
fluctuations for commodities such as corn, cocoa, soybean meal, soybean oil,
and wheat. As of August 1, 2004 the fair value of open contracts related to
commodity hedging activity was $(4).

The company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain employee
compensation obligations. Swap contracts are utilized to hedge exposures
relating to certain employee compensation obligations linked to the total
return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the total return of the
company’s capital stock. The company pays a variable interest rate and
receives the equity returns under these instruments. The notional value of
the equity swap contracts, which mature in 2005, was $34 at August 1, 2004.
These instruments are not designated as accounting hedges. Gains and losses
are recorded in the Statements of Earnings. The net asset recorded under
these contracts at August 1, 2004 was approximately $1.


Shareowners' Equity (Deficit)

The company has authorized 560 million shares of Capital stock with $.0375
par value and 40 million shares of Preferred stock, issuable in one or more
classes, with or without par as may be authorized by the Board of Directors.
No Preferred stock has been issued.

The company sponsors a long-term incentive compensation plan. Under the
plan, restricted stock and options may be granted to certain officers and
key employees of the company. The plan provides for future awards of
approximately 32 million shares of Capital stock, although this amount may
increase upon the lapse, expiration, or termination of previously issued
awards. Options are granted at a price not less than the fair value of the
shares on the date of grant and expire not later than ten years after the
date of grant. Options vest over a three-year period. See also Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on accounting
for stock-based compensation, including the pro forma impact if the company
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123.

In 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the conversion of certain stock
options to shares of restricted stock based on specified conversion ratios.
The exchange, which was voluntary,

replaced approximately 4.7 million
options with approximately one million restricted shares. Depending on the
original grant date of the options, the restricted shares vested in 2002,
2003 or 2004. The company recognized compensation expense throughout the
vesting period of the restricted stock. Compensation expense related to this
award was $3 in 2004, $6 in 2003 and $11 in 2002.

Restricted shares granted are as follows:

For the periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the
calculations of basic earnings per share and earnings per share assuming
dilution vary in that the weighted average shares outstanding assuming
dilution includes the incremental effect of stock options and restricted
stock programs, except when such effect would be antidilutive. Stock options
to purchase 26 million shares of capital stock for 2004 and 2003 and 18
million shares of capital stock for 2002 were not included in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of the
stock options exceeded the average market price of the capital stock and
therefore, would be antidilutive.




Commitments and Contingencies

On March 30, 1998, the company effected a spinoff of several of its non-core
businesses to Vlasic Foods International Inc. (VFI). VFI and several of its
affiliates (collectively, Vlasic) commenced cases under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code on January 29, 2001 in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Delaware. Vlasic’s Second Amended Joint Plan of
Distribution under Chapter 11 (the Plan) was confirmed by an order of the
Bankruptcy Court dated November 16, 2001, and became effective on or about
November 29, 2001. The Plan provides for the assignment of various causes of
action allegedly belonging to the Vlasic estates, including claims against
the company allegedly arising from the spinoff, to VFB L.L.C., a limited
liability company (VFB) whose membership interests are to be distributed
under the Plan to Vlasic’s general unsecured creditors.

On February 19, 2002, VFB commenced a lawsuit against the company and
several of its subsidiaries
in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging,
among other things, fraudulent conveyance, illegal dividends and breaches of
fiduciary duty by Vlasic directors alleged to be under the company’s
control. The lawsuit seeks to hold the company liable in an amount necessary
to satisfy all unpaid claims against Vlasic (which VFB estimates in the
amended complaint to be $200), plus unspecified exemplary and punitive
damages. While the ultimate disposition of complex litigation is inherently
difficult to assess, the company believes the action is without merit and is
defending the case vigorously.

The company received an Examination Report from the Internal Revenue Service
on December 23, 2002, which included a challenge to the treatment of gains
and interest deductions claimed in the company’s fiscal 1995 federal income
tax return, relating to transactions involving government securities. If the
proposed adjustment were upheld, it would require the company to pay a net
amount of approximately $100 in taxes, accumulated interest as of December
23, 2002, and penalties. Interest will continue to accrue until the matter
is resolved. The company believes these transactions were properly reported
on its federal income tax return in accordance with applicable tax laws and
regulations in effect during the period involved and is challenging these
adjustments vigorously. While the outcome of proceedings of this type cannot
be predicted with certainty, the company believes that the ultimate outcome
of this matter will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial
condition or results of operation of the company.

The company is a party to other legal proceedings and claims, environmental
matters and tax issues arising out of the normal course of business.
Although the results of the pending claims and litigation cannot be
predicted with certainty, in management’s opinion, the final outcome of
these other legal proceedings and claims, environmental matters and tax
issues will not have a material effect on the consolidated results of
operations, financial position or cash flows of the company.

The company has certain operating lease commitments, primarily related to
warehouse and office facilities, retail store space, and certain equipment.
Future minimum annual rental payments under these operating leases are as
follows:

In November 2002, FIN 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” was
issued. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements relating to a guarantor’s
accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of
guarantees. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor
must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes
under that guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement
provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002.

The company guarantees almost 1,300 bank loans made to Pepperidge Farm
independent sales distributors by third party financial institutions for the
purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of future
payments the company could be required to make under the guarantees is
approximately $95. The company’s guarantees are indirectly secured by the
distribution routes. The company does not believe it is probable that it
will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the
bank loans guaranteed. Prior to the adoption of FIN 45, no amounts were
recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these guarantees.
The amounts recognized as of August 1, 2004 and August 3, 2003 are not
material.

The company has provided certain standard indemnifications in connection
with divestitures, contracts and other transactions. Certain
indemnifications have finite expiration dates. Liabilities recognized based
on known exposures related to such matters are not material at August 1,
2004.

Report of Management

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the management
of the company in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
to reflect the financial position of the company and its operating results.
Financial information appearing throughout this Annual Report is consistent
with that in the financial statements. Management is responsible for the
information and representations in such financial statements, including the
estimates and judgments required for their preparation.

In order to meet its responsibility, management maintains a system of
internal controls designed to assure that assets are safeguarded and that
financial records properly reflect all transactions. The company also
maintains a worldwide auditing function to periodically evaluate the
adequacy and effectiveness of such internal controls, as well as the
company’s administrative procedures and reporting practices. The company
believes that its long-standing emphasis on the highest standards of conduct
and business ethics, set forth in extensive written policy statements,
serves to reinforce its system of internal accounting controls.

The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company’s independent
auditors, covering their audit of the financial statements, is included in
this Annual Report. Their independent audit of the company’s financial
statements includes a review of the system of internal accounting controls
to the extent they consider necessary to evaluate the system as required by
generally accepted auditing standards.

The company’s internal auditors report directly to the Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors, which is composed entirely of Directors who are not
officers or employees of the company. The Audit Committee meets regularly
with the internal auditors, other management personnel, and the independent
auditors. The independent auditors and the internal auditors have had, and
continue to have, direct access to the Audit Committee without the presence
of other management personnel, and have been directed to discuss the results
of their audit work and any matters they believe should be brought to the
Committee’s attention.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareowners and Directors of Campbell Soup Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareowners’ equity (deficit) and cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Campbell Soup Company and its subsidiaries at August 1, 2004 and August 3,
2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended August 1, 2004 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

As
discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
July 29, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No.142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

Column (a) represents stock options granted under the 2003 Long-Term
Incentive Plan, 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 1984 Long-Term
Incentive Plan. No additional awards can be made under the 1994 Long-Term
Incentive Plan or the 1984 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Column (c) represents
the maximum amount of future equity awards that can be made under the 2003
Long-Term Incentive Plan as of August 1, 2004, which may take the form of
stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance unit awards,
restricted stock, restricted performance stock or stock awards. In the event
any award (or portion thereof) under the 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan
lapses, expires or is otherwise terminated without the issuance of any
company capital stock or is settled by delivery of consideration other than
company capital stock, the maximum number of future equity awards that can
be made under the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan automatically increases by
the number of such shares.

(2)

The company’s Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) allows
participants the opportunity to invest in various book accounts, including a
book account that tracks the performance of the company’s capital stock (the
“Stock Account”). Upon distribution, participants may receive the amounts
invested in the Stock Account in the form of shares of capital stock. Column
(a) represents the maximum number of shares that could be issued upon a
complete distribution of all amounts in the Stock Account. This calculation
is based upon the amount of funds in the Stock Account as of August 1, 2004
and a $25.59 share price, which was the closing price of a share of company
stock on July 30, 2004 (the last business day before August 1, 2004).
767,096 of the total number of shares that could be issued upon a complete
distribution of the Plan are fully vested, and 407,813 of the shares are
subject to restrictions.



Deferred Compensation Plan

The Compensation and Organization Committee of
the Board of
Directors approved the Plan. The Plan is an unfunded plan maintained for the
purpose of providing the company’s directors and U.S.-based executives and
key managers the opportunity to defer a portion of their earned
compensation. Plan participants may defer a portion of their base salaries
and all or a portion of their annual incentive compensation, long-term
incentive awards, certain stock option gains (eliminated following fiscal
2004) and director retainers and fees. The Plan was not submitted for
security holder approval because it does not provide additional compensation
to participants. It is a vehicle for participants to defer earned
compensation, and phantom stock units are credited to each participant’s
account based upon the full current market value of the company’s capital
stock.

Each participant’s contributions to the Plan are credited to an investment
account in the participant’s name. Gains and losses in the participant’s
account are based on the performance of the investment choices the
participant has selected. Four investment choices are available, including
the Stock Account. In addition to the Stock Account, participants also
generally have the opportunity to invest in (i) a book account that tracks
the performance of Fidelity’s Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund, (ii) a book
account that tracks the performance of Fidelity’s Puritan Fund, and (iii) a
book account that credits interest at the Wall Street Journal indexed prime
rate (determined on November 1 for the subsequent calendar year).

A participant may reallocate his or her investment account at any time among
the four investment choices, except that (i) stock option gains must be
invested in the Stock Account, (ii) restricted stock awards must be invested
in the Stock Account during the restriction period and (iii) reallocations
of the Stock Account must be made in compliance with the company’s policies
on trading company stock. Dividends on amounts invested in the Stock Account
may be reallocated among the four investment accounts. The company credits a
participant’s account with an amount equal to the matching contribution that
the company would have made to the participant’s 401(k) Plan account if the
participant had not deferred compensation under the Plan. In addition, for
those individuals whose base salary and annual incentive compensation exceed
the Internal Revenue Service indexed compensation limit for the 401(k) Plan,
the company credits such individual’s

account with an amount equal to the
contribution the company would have made to the 401(k) Plan but for the
compensation limit. These company contributions vest in 20% increments over
the participant’s first five (5) years of credited service; after the
participant’s first five (5) years of service, the company contributions
vest automatically. Except as described above, there is no company match on
deferred compensation.

For terminations and retirements, a participant’s account is generally paid
out in accordance with the last valid distribution election made by the
participant. The applicable elections include: (i) a lump sum, (ii) 5 annual
installments, (iii) 10 annual installments, (iv) 15 annual installments (not
available to participants terminated prior to their 55th birthday), and (v)
20 annual installments (not available to participants terminated prior to
their 55th birthday). For distributions upon death, if a participant’s
beneficiary is his or her spouse, the account is generally paid out in
accordance with the last valid death distribution election (or, if there is
no death distribution election, the regular distribution election). If a
participant’s beneficiary is not his or her spouse, then the account is
generally paid out in a lump sum. The Plan administrator has also
established procedures for hardship withdrawals and unplanned withdrawals
(with a penalty). The current penalty for unplanned withdrawals is 10%. In
the event of a change in control of the company, the Stock Account is
automatically converted into cash based upon a formula provided in the Plan.
