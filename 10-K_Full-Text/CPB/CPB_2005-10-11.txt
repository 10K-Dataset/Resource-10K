Part I

Item 1. Business

The Company

Campbell Soup Company (“Campbell” or the
“company”), together with its consolidated subsidiaries,
is a global manufacturer and marketer of high-quality,
branded convenience food products. Campbell was
incorporated as a business corporation under the laws of
New Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through
predecessor organizations, it traces its heritage in the
food business back to 1869. The company’s principal
executive offices are in Camden, New Jersey 08103-1799.

On June 24, 2004, the company announced a series of
initiatives designed to improve the company’s sales
growth and the quality and growth of its earnings.
Beginning with fiscal 2006, the company updated the
strategies it is using to continue this effort. The five
strategies include:

Through fiscal 2004, the company’s operations were
organized and reported in four segments: North America
Soup and Away From Home; North America Sauces and
Beverages; Biscuits and Confectionery; and International
Soup and Sauces. Beginning with fiscal 2005, the company
changed its organizational structure and as a result its
operations are organized and reported in the following
segments: U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages; Baking and
Snacking; International Soup and Sauces; and Other. The
new segments are discussed in greater detail below.

U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages

The U.S. Soup, Sauces and
Beverages segment includes the following retail
businesses:

Campbell’s

condensed and ready-to-serve
soups;

Swanson

broth and canned poultry;

Prego

pasta sauce;

Pace

Mexican sauce;

Campbell’s Chunky

chili;

Campbell’s

canned
pasta, gravies, and beans;

Campbell’s Supper Bakes

meal
kits;

V8

vegetable juice;

V8 Splash

juice beverages; and

Campbell’s

tomato juice.

Baking and Snacking

The Baking and Snacking segment
includes the following businesses:

Pepperidge Farm

cookies, crackers, bakery and frozen products in U.S.
retail;

Arnott’s

biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific;
and

Arnott’s

salty snacks in Australia.

International Soup and Sauces

The International Soup and
Sauces segment includes the soup, sauce and beverage
businesses outside of the United States, including
Europe, Mexico,

Latin America, the Asia Pacific region and the retail
business in Canada. The segment’s operations include

Erasco

and

Heisse Tasse

soups in Germany,

Liebig

and

Royco

soups and

Lesieur

sauces in France,

Campbell’s

and

Batchelors

soups,

OXO

stock cubes and

Homepride

sauces in
the United Kingdom,

Devos Lemmens

mayonnaise and cold
sauces and

Campbell’s

and

Royco

soups in Belgium,

Blå
Band

soups and sauces in Sweden, and

McDonnells

and

Erin

soups in Ireland. In Asia Pacific, operations include

Campbell’s

soup and stock and

Swanson

broths across the
region. In Canada, operations include

Habitant

and

Campbell’s

soups,

Prego

pasta sauce and

V8

juices.

Other

The balance of the portfolio reported in Other
includes Godiva Chocolatier worldwide and the company’s
Away From Home operations, which represent the
distribution of products such as soup, specialty entrees,
beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge
Farm products through various food service channels in
the United States and Canada.

Ingredients

The ingredients required for the manufacture
of the company’s food products are purchased from various
suppliers. While all such ingredients are available from
numerous independent suppliers, raw materials are subject
to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of
factors, including changes in crop size, cattle cycles,
government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and
export requirements and weather conditions during the
growing and harvesting seasons. To help reduce some of
this volatility, the company uses commodity futures
contracts for a number of its ingredients, such as corn,
cocoa, soybean meal, soybean oil and wheat. Ingredient
inventories are at a peak during the late fall and
decline during the winter and spring. Since many
ingredients of suitable quality are available in
sufficient quantities only at certain seasons, the
company makes commitments for the purchase of such
ingredients during their respective seasons. At this
time, the company does not anticipate any material
restrictions on availability or shortages of ingredients
that would have a significant impact on the company’s
businesses. For additional information on the company’s
ingredient management and for information relating to the
impact of inflation on the company, see “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial
Condition” and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Customers

In most of the company’s markets, sales
activities are conducted by the company’s own sales force
and through broker and distributor arrangements. In the
United States, Canada and Latin America, the company’s
products are generally resold to consumers in retail food
chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club
stores, convenience stores, drug stores and other retail
establishments. In Europe, the company’s products are
generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass
discounters and other retail establishments. In Mexico,
the company’s products are generally resold to consumers
in retail food chains, club stores, convenience stores,
drug stores



and other retail establishments. In the Asia Pacific
region, the company’s products are generally resold to
consumers through retail food chains, convenience stores
and other retail establishments. Godiva Chocolatier’s
products are sold generally through a network of
company-owned retail boutiques in North America, Europe
and Asia, franchised third-party retail boutique
operators in Europe, third-party distributors in Europe
and Asia, and major retailers, including finer department
stores and duty-free shops, worldwide. Godiva
Chocolatier’s products are also sold through catalogs and
on the Internet, although these sales are primarily
limited to North America and Japan. The company makes
shipments promptly after receipt and acceptance of
orders.

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and
its affiliates, accounted for approximately 14% of the
company’s consolidated net sales during fiscal 2005 and
12% during fiscal 2004. All of the company’s segments
sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates.
No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the
company’s consolidated net sales.

Trademarks and Technology

The company owns over 6,900
trademark registrations and applications in over 160
countries and believes that its trademarks are of
material importance to its business. Although the laws
vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally are valid as
long as they are in use and/or their registrations are
properly maintained and have not been found to have
become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be
renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in
use. The company believes that its principal brands,
including

Campbell’s, Erasco, Liebig, Pepperidge Farm,
V8, Pace, Prego, Swanson, Batchelors, Arnott’s,

and

Godiva,

are protected by trademark law in the company’s
relevant major markets. In addition, some of the
company’s products are sold under brands that have been
licensed from third parties.

Although the company owns a number of valuable patents,
it does not regard any segment of its business as being
dependent upon any single patent or group of related
patents. In addition, the company owns copyrights, both
registered and
unregistered, and proprietary trade secrets, technology,
know-how processes, and other intellectual property
rights that are not registered.

Competition

The company experiences worldwide competition
in all of its principal products. This competition arises
from numerous competitors of varying sizes, including
producers of generic and private label products, as well
as from manufacturers of other branded food products,
which compete for trade merchandising support and
consumer dollars. As such, the number of competitors
cannot be reliably estimated. The principal areas of
competition are brand recognition, quality, price,
advertising, promotion, convenience and service.

Working Capital

For information relating to the company’s
cash and working capital items, see “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition.”

Capital Expenditures

During fiscal 2005, the company’s
aggregate capital expenditures were $332 million. The
company expects to spend approximately $360 million for
capital projects in fiscal 2006. The major fiscal 2006
capital projects include the ongoing implementation of
the SAP enterprise-resource planning system in North
America and the construction of a new facility in
Everett, Washington, for the company’s Stockpot
subsidiary.

Research and Development

During the last three fiscal
years, the company’s expenditures on research activities
relating to new products and the improvement and
maintenance of existing products were $95 million in
2005, $93 million in 2004 and $88 million in 2003. The
increase during the last two fiscal years in research and
development spending was primarily due to currency
fluctuations. The company conducts this research
primarily at its headquarters in Camden, New Jersey,
although important research is undertaken at various
other locations inside and outside the United States.

Environmental Matters

The company has requirements for
the operation and design of its facilities that meet or
exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations. Of
the company’s $332 million in capital expenditures made
during fiscal 2005, approximately $5.8 million was for
compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the
United States. The company further estimates that
approximately $6.4 million of the capital expenditures
anticipated during fiscal 2006 will be for compliance
with such environmental laws and regulations. The company
believes that continued compliance with existing
environmental laws and regulations will not have a
material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the
competitive position of the company. Additional
information regarding the company’s environmental matters
is set forth in “Legal Proceedings.”

Seasonality

Demand for the company’s products is somewhat
seasonal, with the fall and winter months usually
accounting for the highest sales volume due primarily to
demand for the company’s soup and sauce products. Godiva
Chocolatier sales are also strongest during the fall and
winter months. Demand
for the company’s beverage, baking and snacking products,
however, is generally evenly distributed throughout the
year.

Regulation

The manufacture and marketing of food products
is highly regulated. In the United States, the company is
subject to regulation by various government agencies,
including the Food and Drug Administration, the
Department of Agriculture and the Federal Trade
Commission, as well as various state and local agencies.
The company is also regulated by similar agencies outside
the United States and by voluntary organizations such as
the National Advertising Division of the Better Business
Bureau.

Employees

On July 31, 2005, there were approximately
24,000 full-time employees of the company.

Each of the foregoing manufacturing facilities is
company-owned, except that the Woodinville, Washington,
facility; the Scoresby, Australia, facility; the Selangor
Darul Ehsan, Malaysia, facility; and portions of the
Ashford, United Kingdom, facility are leased. The
Utrecht, Netherlands, facility is subject to a ground
lease. The company also operates retail confectionery
shops in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia;
retail bakery thrift stores in the United States; and
other plants, facilities and offices at various locations
in the United States and abroad, including additional

executive offices in Norwalk, Connecticut; Paris, France;
and Homebush, Australia. On July 15, 2005, the company
announced plans to build a new facility in Everett,
Washington, to replace the existing Woodinville,
Washington, facility for the manufacture of refrigerated
soups by its Stockpot subsidiary.

Management believes that the company’s manufacturing and
processing plants are well maintained and are generally
adequate to support the current operations of the
businesses.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

As previously reported, on March 30, 1998, the
company effected a spinoff of several of its non-core
businesses to Vlasic Foods International Inc. (“VFI”).
VFI and several of its affiliates (collectively,
“Vlasic”) commenced cases under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code on January 29, 2001 in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Vlasic’s
Second Amended Joint Plan of Distribution under Chapter
11 (the “Plan”) was confirmed by an order of the
Bankruptcy Court dated November 16, 2001, and became
effective on or about November 29, 2001. The Plan
provides for the assignment of various causes of action
allegedly belonging to the Vlasic estates, including
claims against the company allegedly arising from the
spinoff, to VFB L.L.C., a limited liability company
(“VFB”) whose membership interests are to be distributed
under the Plan to Vlasic’s general unsecured creditors.

On February 19, 2002, VFB commenced a lawsuit against the
company and several of its subsidiaries in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware
alleging, among other things, fraudulent conveyance,
illegal dividends and breaches
of fiduciary duty by Vlasic directors alleged to be under
the company’s control. The lawsuit seeks to hold the
company liable in an amount necessary to satisfy all
unpaid claims against Vlasic (which VFB estimates in the
amended complaint to be $200 million), plus unspecified
exemplary and punitive damages.

Following a trial on the merits, on September 13, 2005,
the District Court issued Post-Trial Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of Law, ruling in favor of the company and
against VFB on all claims. The Court ruled that VFB
failed to prove that the spinoff was a constructive or
actual fraudulent transfer. The Court also rejected VFB’s
claim of breach of fiduciary duty, VFB’s claim that VFI
was an alter ego of the company, and VFB’s claim that the
spinoff should be deemed an illegal dividend. VFB will
have 30 days following the entry of the judgment of the
District Court to appeal the decision.

As previously reported, the company received an
Examination Report from the Internal Revenue Service on
December 23, 2002,

which included a challenge to the treatment of gains and
interest deductions claimed in the company’s fiscal 1995
federal income tax return, relating to transactions
involving government securities. If the proposed
adjustment were upheld, it would require the company to
pay a net amount of approximately $100 million in taxes,
accumulated interest to December 23, 2002, and penalties.
Interest will continue to accrue until the matter is
resolved. The company believes these transactions were
properly reported on its federal income tax return in
accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations in
effect during the period involved and is challenging
these adjustments vigorously. The company expects a final
resolution of this matter in fiscal 2006.

As previously reported, on July 15, 2003, Pepperidge
Farm, Incorporated, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of the company, made a submission to the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) relating to its
use and replacement of certain appliances containing
ozone-depleting refrigerants. The submission was made
pursuant to the terms of the Ozone-Depleting Substance
Emission Reduction Bakery Partnership Agreement (the “EPA
Agreement”) entered into by and between Pepperidge Farm
and the EPA. Pepperidge Farm executed the EPA Agreement
in April 2002 as part of a voluntary EPA-sponsored
program relating to the reduction of ozone-depleting
refrigerants used in the bakery industry. As a result of
the EPA Agreement, as of July 31, 2005, Pepperidge Farm
has incurred costs of
approximately $4.75 million relating to the evaluation
and replacement of certain of its refrigerant appliances.
Of this amount, $4 million was incurred in fiscal 2003;
the remainder was incurred in fiscal 2004. If the
submission is approved by the EPA, in addition to the
expenditures previously made, Pepperidge Farm will be
required to pay a penalty in the amount of approximately
$370 thousand.

Although the results of these matters cannot be predicted
with certainty, in management’s opinion, the final
outcome of these legal proceedings, tax issues and
environmental matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the consolidated results of operations or
financial condition of the company.

In 2003, the company adopted SFAS No. 142 resulting in the elimination of amortization of
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Prior periods have not been restated. See
Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The 2003 fiscal year consisted of fifty-three weeks compared to fifty-two weeks in all other
periods. The additional week contributed 2 percentage points of the sales increase compared to
2002, and approximately $.02 per share to net earnings.


2004 results include a pre-tax restructuring charge of $32 ($22 after tax or $.05 per share
basic and assuming dilution) related to a reduction in workforce and the implementation of a
distribution and logistics realignment in Australia.


2002 results include pre-tax costs of $20 ($14 after tax or $.03 per share basic and assuming
dilution) related to an Australian manufacturing reconfiguration.


2001 results include pre-tax costs of $15 ($11 after tax or $.03 per share basic and assuming
dilution) related to an Australian manufacturing reconfiguration.



Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Results of Operations

Overview


Net earnings were $707 million ($1.71 per share) in
compared to $647 million ($1.57 per share) in 2004. (All
earnings per share amounts included in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis are presented on a diluted
basis.) Net earnings between 2005 and 2004 were impacted
by an increase in sales, lower corporate expenses and the
favorable impact of currency, partially offset by a
decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales and an
increase in interest expense. The 2004 results were also
impacted by the following:

•

A pre-tax restructuring charge of $32 million ($22
million after tax or $.05 per share) related to a
reduction in workforce and the implementation of a
distribution and logistics realignment in Australia. (See
also the section entitled Restructuring Program and Note
5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);

•

A pre-tax gain of $16 million ($10 million after tax or
$.02 per share) from a settlement of a class action
lawsuit involving ingredient suppliers; and

•

A pre-tax gain of $10 million ($6 million after tax or
$.02 per share) from a sale of a manufacturing site in
California.

The gains were recorded in Other expenses/(income).


In 2004, net earnings increased 3% to $647 million
from $626 million before the cumulative effect of
accounting change and earnings per share increased 3% to
$1.57 from $1.52 in 2003.

In addition to the 2004 restructuring charge and gains,
earnings between 2004 and 2003 before the cumulative
effect of accounting change were also impacted by an
increase in sales, favorable currency translation, lower
interest expense and a lower tax rate, partially offset
by a decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales and
higher administrative expenses. In addition, there were
52 weeks in 2004 and 53 weeks in 2003. The additional
week contributed approximately $.02 per share to
earnings.

In connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, the company
recognized a non-cash charge of $31 million (net of a $17
million tax benefit), or $.08 per share, in the first
quarter of 2003 as a cumulative effect of accounting
change. This charge related to impaired goodwill
associated with the Stockpot business, a food service
business acquired in August 1998. See also Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the first quarter 2004, the company acquired certain
Australian chocolate biscuit brands for approximately $9
million. These brands are included in the Baking and
Snacking segment.

During the first quarter of 2003, the company acquired
two businesses for cash consideration of approximately
$170 million and assumed debt of approximately $20
million. The company acquired Snack Foods Limited, a
leader in the Australian salty snack category, and Erin
Foods, the number two dry soup manufacturer in Ireland.
Snack Foods Limited is
included in the Baking and Snacking segment. Erin Foods
is included in the International Soup and Sauces segment.
The businesses have annual sales of approximately $160
million.

In 2005, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales
increased 3%. U.S. soup sales increased 5%, driven by an
8% gain in
condensed soup and a 12% increase in broth, partially
offset by a 1% decline in ready-to-serve soup. The U.S.
condensed soup increase was driven by a double-digit
increase in eating soups, due in part to the combination
of successful merchandising and kids promotional
marketing programs, increased advertising and higher
prices. Cooking varieties of condensed soup also achieved
sales growth behind strong performance during the holiday
season. Condensed soup sales also benefited from
gravity-feed shelving systems installed in retail stores.
Broth sales increased, driven by gains achieved through
its expanded use in cooking and strong consumer response
to two new organic varieties in aseptic containers
introduced earlier in 2005. In ready-to-serve soup,

Campbell’s Chunky

soup sales increased 7%. These gains
were offset by declines in sales of

Campbell’s Select

soups and

Campbell’s Kitchen Classics

soups. The

Campbell’s Select

soups decline of 15% was due to volume losses resulting
from competitive activity. Sales of microwaveable soups
were flat for the year, as double-digit growth of

Campbell’s Chunky

and

Campbell’s Select

soups in
microwaveable bowls was offset by declines in

Campbell’s
Soup at Hand

sippable soups. In other parts of the
business, the launch of

Campbell’s Chunky

chili in 2005
added to sales gains.

Campbell’s SpaghettiOs

pasta sales
rose as consumers responded to the transition from the

Franco-American

brand to the

Campbell’s

brand and to new
advertising. Sales of

Prego

pasta sauces declined
slightly, while sales of

Pace

Mexican sauces were flat
for the year.

V8

vegetable juice sales increased due to
higher prices and improved volume, while sales of

V8
Splash

juice beverages and

Campbell’s

tomato juice
declined.

In 2004, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased
2%. U.S. soup sales increased 2%, driven by an 8% gain in
ready-to-serve soup, partially offset by a 2% decline in
condensed soup. The ready-to-serve sales performance was
driven by the strong performance from microwaveable
soups, including

Campbell’s Select

and

Campbell’s Chunky

soups, which were introduced in 2004, and

Campbell’s Soup
at Hand

sippable soups. Broth sales increased 6%.
Beverage sales increased, led by growth of

V8

vegetable
juice. Sales of

Pace

Mexican sauces were equal to 2003,
and

Prego

pasta sauces experienced a decline in sales,
attributable in part to weakness in the dry pasta
category.

Baking and Snacking sales increased 8% in 2005 versus
2004. Pepperidge Farm contributed significantly to the
sales increase as a result of sales gains across bakery,
cookies and crackers and frozen, primarily due to higher
volume and increased prices. The fresh bakery business
experienced double-digit growth as

a result of expanded distribution and product
improvements on bagels and English muffins along with
strong results from

Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse

breads and

Pepperidge Farm

Carb
Style breads and rolls. In cookies and crackers, sales
growth was driven by

Pepperidge Farm

Chocolate Chunk
cookies, four new soft-baked varieties of cookies, and
the
introduction of sugar-free cookies and

Whims

poppable
snacks. In addition,

Pepperidge Farm Goldfish

crackers
delivered sales growth. Pepperidge Farm frozen product
sales increased behind the strong performance of pot
pies, breads and pastry. Arnott’s sales grew primarily
due to currency and volume gains. Arnott’s achieved sales
growth in each of its three businesses: sweet biscuits,
savory biscuits and salty snacks.

Baking and Snacking sales increased 13% in 2004 versus
2003. The favorable currency impact was due primarily to
the strengthening of the Australian dollar. Pepperidge
Farm contributed to the sales increase as a result of
growth in

Goldfish

crackers and fresh bread. Arnott’s
achieved an increase in sales driven by innovation on the

Tim Tam, Shapes

and

Jatz

products and new product
offerings in the

Snack Right

and

Salada

brands.

International Soup and Sauces sales increased 7% in 2005
versus 2004, driven primarily by currency. In Europe,
strong sales gains of wet and dry soups in France and

Campbell’s

wet soups in Belgium also contributed to
growth. In Asia Pacific, Australian beverages and broth
delivered volume gains, while sales increased in Asia, in
part, from the launch of a new dry soup product targeting
breakfast consumption. Canada achieved volume growth due
in part to its ready-to-serve soup business, which
includes a new aseptic variety,

Campbell’s Gardennay

soup.

International Soup and Sauces sales increased 11% in 2004
versus 2003, primarily due to currency. The increase in
volume and mix was driven primarily by sales gains in
France, Australia, Belgium and Asia, partially offset by
sales declines in the United Kingdom and Germany. In
Australia, soup had strong sales and volume growth driven
by

Campbell’s Country Ladle

and

Chunky

soup.

In Other, sales increased 11% in 2005 versus 2004. Away
From Home delivered strong sales growth, led by premium
refrigerated soups. Godiva Chocolatier’s worldwide sales
increased double-digits with North America, Europe and
Asia all contributing to growth. In North America, Godiva
achieved double-digit same-store sales results driven by
successful new products, including sugar-free chocolates
and the relaunch of truffles.

In Other, sales increased 4% in 2004 versus 2003. Away
From Home sales grew slightly, primarily due to strong
sales of premium refrigerated soups. Godiva Chocolatier’s
worldwide sales increased due to improving same-store
sales trends in North America and increased sales in duty
free stores.



Gross Margin

Gross margin, defined as Net sales less
Cost of products sold, increased by $135 million in 2005.
As a percent of sales, gross margin was 40.5% in 2005,
41.1% in 2004 and 43.0% in 2003. The percentage point
decrease in 2005 was
due to the impact of inflation and other factors
(approximately 3.0 percentage points), a higher level of
promotional spending (approximately 0.3 percentage
points) and mix (approximately 0.1 percentage points),
partially offset by productivity improvements
(approximately 2.0 percentage points) and higher selling
prices (approximately 0.8 percentage points). The
percentage point decrease in 2004 was due to costs
associated with quality and packaging improvements
(approximately 1.0 percentage point), mix (approximately
0.7 percentage points), higher pension expense and the
impact of acquisitions (approximately 0.3 percentage
points), and the impact of inflation and other factors
(approximately 2.7 percentage points), partially offset
by higher selling prices (approximately 0.9 percentage
points) and productivity improvements (approximately 1.9
percentage points).

Marketing and Selling Expenses

Marketing and selling
expenses as a percent of sales were 15.7% in 2005, 16.2%
in 2004 and 17.1% in 2003. Marketing and selling expenses
increased 3% in 2005. The increase was driven by higher
levels of advertising and currency. In 2004, Marketing
and selling expenses increased 1% from 2003. The increase
was driven by currency, partially offset by reductions in
marketing expenses related to consumer promotion activity
and lower media production costs.

Administrative Expenses

Administrative expenses as a
percent of sales were 7.6% in 2005, 2004, and 2003.
Administrative expenses increased by 5% in 2005 from
2004. Currency accounted for approximately 2 percentage
points of the increase and costs associated with the
implementation of the SAP enterprise-resource planning
system in North America accounted for 2 percentage points
of the increase. Administrative expenses increased by 7%
in 2004 from 2003. Currency accounted for approximately 4
percentage points of the increase, with the balance due
to general inflationary increases and costs associated
with litigation.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and
development expenses increased $2 million or 2% in 2005
from 2004, primarily due to currency. Research and
development expenses increased $5 million or 6% in 2004
from 2003, primarily due to currency, which accounted for
approximately 4 percentage points of the increase.

Other Expenses/(Income)

Other income in 2005 of $4 million was primarily royalty income related to the
company’s brands.

Other income in 2004 of $13 million included a $16
million gain from the company’s share of a class action
settlement involving ingredient suppliers, a $10 million
gain on a sale of a manu-

facturing site, other net income of $4 million, partially
offset by a $10 million adjustment to the carrying value
of long-term investments in affordable housing
partnerships and $7 million in expenses from currency
hedging related to the financing of international
activities.

Other expenses of $28 million in 2003 included a $36
million
adjustment to the carrying value of long-term investments
in affordable housing partnerships, $15 million in
expenses from currency hedging related to the financing
of international activities, partially offset by $16
million of gains on the sales of land and buildings, a $5
million one-time payment for the transfer of the Godiva
Chocolatier ice cream license, and other net income of $2
million. The sales of land and buildings relate to the
closures of a dry soup plant in Ireland ($8 million) and
an Arnott’s plant in Melbourne, Australia ($8 million).

Operating Earnings

Segment operating earnings increased
6% in 2005 from 2004.

Segment operating earnings declined 3% in 2004 from 2003.
The restructuring charge accounted for 2 percentage
points of the decline.

Contributions to earnings by segment include the effect of a pre-tax fourth quarter 2004
restructuring charge of $32 million as follows: U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages — $8 million,
Baking and Snacking — $10 million, International Soup and Sauces — $10 million, Other — $3
million and Corporate — $1 million.

Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages
increased 2% in 2005 versus 2004. The 2004 results
included an $8 million restructuring charge. The
remaining increase in 2005 was due to productivity
improvements and higher sales volume and prices,
partially offset by cost inflation and increased
marketing.

Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages decreased
5% in 2004 versus 2003. The 2004 results included an $8
million restructuring charge, which accounted for 1
percentage point of the earnings decline. The remainder
of the earnings decline was due to quality improvements,
higher inflation and product mix, partially offset by an
increase in sales and productivity improvements.



Earnings from Baking and Snacking increased 19% in
2005 versus 2004. The 2004 results included a $10 million
restructuring charge. Currency accounted for 3 percentage
points of the earnings increase. The remaining increase
in earnings was due to sales growth in Pepperidge Farm
and improvement in the Snackfoods business in Australia,
partially offset by expenses associated with the
implementation of a new sales and distribution system in
Australia.

Earnings from Baking and Snacking increased 3% in 2004
versus 2003. The 2004 results included a $10 million
restructuring charge, which reduced earnings by 6
percentage points. Currency accounted for 9 percentage
points of growth.

Earnings from International Soup and Sauces increased 8%
in 2005 versus 2004. The 2004 results included a $10
million restructuring charge. The remaining increase in
earnings was due to the favorable impact of currency (6
percentage points) and operating earnings growth in
Canada, partially offset by declines in Europe and Latin
America.

Earnings from International Soup and Sauces increased 2%
in 2004 versus 2003. Currency accounted for 11 percentage
points of growth, partially offset by a $10 million
restructuring charge (approximately 5 percentage points)
and declines in earnings in Canada and Europe.

Earnings from Other increased 9% in 2005 from
2004. The 2004 results included a $3 million
restructuring charge. Currency accounted for 2 percentage
points of the increase. The remainder of the increase was
due to the strong sales growth in Godiva Chocolatier and
Away From Home.

Earnings from Other increased 1% in 2004 from 2003. The
2004 results included a $3 million restructuring charge,
which negatively impacted earnings by 3 percentage
points. Currency accounted for 4 percentage points of
growth.

Corporate expenses decreased in 2005 due to lower costs
associated with ongoing litigation, lower adjustments
related to the carrying value of long-term investments in
affordable housing partnerships, and lower expenses from
currency hedging related to the financing of
international activities, partially offset by the gains
in 2004 related to the company’s share of a class action
lawsuit involving ingredient suppliers and the sale of a
manufacturing site in California.

Corporate expenses decreased in 2004, primarily due to
lower adjustments related to the carrying value of
long-term investments in affordable housing partnerships,
the gain from the company’s share of a class action
lawsuit involving ingredient suppliers, the

gain on sale of a manufacturing site in California, lower
expenses from currency hedging related to the financing
of international activities, partially offset by
increases in costs associated with ongoing litigation.

Nonoperating Items

Interest expense increased 6% in 2005
from 2004, primarily due to higher interest rates,
partially offset by lower levels of debt.

Interest expense declined 6% in 2004 from 2003, primarily
due to lower levels of debt.

The effective tax rate was 31.4% in 2005, 31.7% in 2004
and 32.2% in 2003. The reduction in the rate in 2005 from
2004 was due to lower international taxes, which
reflected a one-time benefit in Australia related to a
change in tax law. The reduction in the rate from 2003 to
2004 reflected a lower U.S. tax liability which resulted
from an increase in charitable contribution deductions
and research and development credits, and the favorable
resolution of certain income tax audits.

Restructuring Program

A restructuring charge of $32
million ($22 million after tax) was recorded in the
fourth quarter 2004 for severance and employee benefit
costs associated with a worldwide reduction in workforce
and with the implementation of a distribution and
logistics realignment in Australia. These programs are
part of cost savings initiatives designed to improve the
company’s operating margins and asset utilization.
Approximately 400 positions were eliminated under the
reduction in workforce program resulting in a
restructuring charge of $23 million. The reductions
represented the elimination of layers of management,
elimination of redundant positions due to the realignment
of operations in North America, and reorganization of the
U.S. sales force. The majority of the terminations
occurred in the fourth quarter of 2004. Annual pre-tax
savings from the reduction are expected to be
approximately $40 million beginning in 2005.

The distribution and logistics realignment in Australia
involves the conversion of a direct store delivery system
to a central warehouse system. A restructuring charge of
$9 million was recorded for this program. As a result of
this program, over 200 positions will be eliminated due
to the outsourcing of the infrastructure. The majority of
the terminations occurred in 2005. Annual pre-tax
benefits are expected to be approximately $10-$15 million
beginning in 2008. The cash outflows related to these
programs are not expected to have a material adverse
effect on the company’s liquidity.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion of these programs.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash flows from operating activities provided
$990 million in 2005, compared to $744 million in 2004.
The increase was due primarily to a lower increase in
working capital, an increase in earnings, and lower cash
settlements related to foreign currency hedging
transactions. Net cash flows from operating activities
provided $744 million in 2004, compared to $873 million
in 2003. The reduction was due to higher working capital
requirements and an increase in pension fund
contributions, partially offset by an increase in
earnings. Over the last three years, operating cash flows
totaled approximately $2.6 billion. This cash generating capability provides
the company with substantial financial flexibility in
meeting its operating and investing needs.

Capital expenditures were $332 million in 2005, $288
million in 2004 and $283 million in 2003. Capital
expenditures are projected to be approximately $360
million in 2006. The increase in 2005 was primarily
driven by investments to increase manufacturing capacity
for microwaveable products, implement the SAP
enterprise-resource planning system in North America,
increase manufacturing capacity for refrigerated soups,
and implement a new sales and distribution system in
Australia. The increase in 2004 was primarily driven by
currency. Capital expenditures in 2004 included projects
to increase manufacturing capacity for soup, beverages
and

Goldfish Sandwich Snackers

crackers, as well as
investments in U.S. sales systems.

Businesses acquired, as presented in the Statements of
Cash Flows, represents the acquisition of certain brands
from George Weston Foods Limited in Australia in the
first quarter of 2004 and the acquisitions of Snack Foods
Limited and Erin Foods in the first quarter of 2003.

There were no new long-term borrowings in 2005. Long-term
borrowings in 2004 included the issuance of $300 million
of ten-year 4.875% fixed-rate notes due October 2013. The
proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings
and for other general corporate purposes. While planning
for the issuance of these notes, the company entered into
treasury lock agreements with a notional value of $100
million that effectively fixed a portion of the interest
rate on the debt prior to issuance of the notes. These
agreements were settled at a minimal gain upon issuance
of the notes, which will be amortized over the life of
the notes. In connection with this issuance, the company
entered into ten-year interest rate swaps that converted
$200 million of the fixed-rate debt to variable.

In September 2003, the company also entered into $100
million five-year interest rate swaps that converted a
portion of the 5.875% fixed-rate notes due October 2008
to variable.

In April 2004, the company entered into a $50 million
interest rate swap that converted a portion of the 6.9%
fixed-rate notes due October 2006 to variable.

In May 2004, the company entered into a $50 million
interest rate swap that converted a portion of the 6.9%
fixed-rate notes due October 2006 to variable.

Long-term borrowings in 2003 included the issuance of
$400 million of ten-year 5% fixed-rate notes due December
2012. The proceeds were used to retire $300 million 6.15%
notes and to repay commercial paper borrowings. In
connection with this issuance, the company entered into
ten-year interest rate swaps that converted $300 million
of the fixed-rate debt to variable.

In November 2002, the company terminated interest rate
swap contracts with a notional value of $250 million that
converted fixed-rate debt (6.75% notes due 2011) to
variable and received $37 million. Of this amount, $3
million represented accrued interest earned on the swap
prior to the termination date. The remainder will be
amortized over the remaining life of the notes as a
reduction to interest expense.

In June 2002, the company filed a $1 billion shelf
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to use for future offerings of debt
securities. Under the registration statement, the company
may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on
market conditions. The company intends to use the
proceeds to repay short-term debt, to reduce or retire
other indebtedness or for other general corporate
purposes. As of July 31, 2005, the company had $300
million available for issuance under this registration
statement.

Dividend payments were $275 million in 2005 and $259
million in 2004 and 2003. Annual dividends declared in
2005 were $.68 and $.63 per share in 2004 and 2003. The
2005 fourth quarter rate was $.17 per share.

The company repurchased 4 million shares at a cost of
$110 million during 2005, compared to 2 million shares at
a cost of $56 million during 2004 and 1 million shares at
a cost of $24 million during 2003. The company expects to
repurchase sufficient shares over time to offset the
impact of dilution from shares issued under the company’s
stock compensation plans. See “Market For Registrant’s
Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities” for more information.

At July 31, 2005, the company had $451 million of notes
payable due within one year and $35 million of standby
letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. The
company maintained committed revolving credit facilities
totaling $1.5 billion, which were unused at July 31, 2005
except for $5 million of



standby letters of credit. Another $30 million of
standby letters of credit was issued under a separate
facility. In September 2005, the company entered into a
$500 million committed 364-day revolving credit facility,
which replaced the existing $500 million 364-day facility
that matured in September 2005. The 364-day revolving
credit facility contains a one-year term-out feature. The
company also has a $1 billion revolving multi-year credit
facility. In September 2005, the maturity of this
facility was extended from 2009 to 2010. These agreements
support the company’s commercial paper program.

The company is in compliance with the covenants contained
in its revolving credit facilities and debt securities.

The company believes that foreseeable liquidity,
including the resolution of the contingencies described
in Note 20 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, and capital resource
requirements are expected to be met through anticipated
cash flows from operations, management of working
capital, long-term borrowings under its shelf
registration, and short-term borrowings, including
commercial paper. The company believes that its sources
of financing are adequate to meet its future liquidity
and capital resource requirements. The cost and terms of
any future financing arrangements depend on the market
conditions and the company’s financial position at that
time.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments

Contractual Obligations

The following table
summarizes the company’s obligations and commitments to
make future payments under certain contractual
obligations. For additional information on debt, see Note
16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating
leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and
office facilities, retail store space, and certain
equipment. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders
and long-term purchase arrangements related to the
procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery,
equipment and services. These commitments are not
expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other
long-term liabilities primarily represent payments
related to deferred compensation obligations and
postemployment benefits. For additional information on
other long-term liabilities, see Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest payments for notes payable, long-term debt
and derivative instruments are calculated as
follows. For notes payable, interest is based on par
values and coupon rates of contractually obligated
issuances at fiscal year end. For long-term debt,
interest is based on principal amounts and fixed
coupon rates at fiscal year end. Interest on
fixed-rate derivative instruments is based on
notional amounts and fixed interest rates
contractually obligated at fiscal year end. Interest
on variable-rate derivative instruments is based on
notional amounts contractually obligated at fiscal
year end and weighted-average rates estimated over
the instrument’s life using forward interest rates
plus applicable spreads.


Represents other long-term liabilities, excluding
deferred taxes and minority interest. This table
does not include postretirement medical benefits or
payments related to pension plans. The company made
a $35 million voluntary contribution to a U.S. plan
subsequent to July 31, 2005.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements and Other Commitments

The company guarantees approximately 1,400 bank loans to
Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third
party financial institutions used to purchase
distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the
future payments the company could be required to make
under the guarantees is $112 million. The company’s
guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution
routes. The company does not believe that it is probable
that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a
result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. See also
Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on off-balance sheet arrangements.

Inflation

During the past two years, inflation, on average, has
been higher than previous years but has not had a
significant effect on the company. The company uses a
number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost
inflation. These strategies include increasing prices,
pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global
procurement strategies, and making capital investments
that improve the efficiency of operations.



Market Risk Sensitivity

The principal market risks to which the company is
exposed are changes in commodity prices, interest rates
and foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the
company is exposed to equity price changes related to
certain employee compensation obligations. The company
manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by
optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt
and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain
its variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted
guidelines. International operations, which accounted for
over 35% of 2005 net sales, are concentrated principally
in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the United
Kingdom. The company manages its foreign currency
exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and
utilizing cross-currency swaps and forward contracts.
Swaps and forward contracts are entered into for periods
consistent with related underlying exposures and do not
constitute positions independent of those exposures. The
company does not enter into contracts for speculative
purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.

The company principally uses a combination of purchase
orders and various short- and long-term supply
arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw
materials, including certain

commodities and agricultural products. The company may
also enter into commodity futures contracts, as
considered appropriate, to reduce the volatility of price
fluctuations for commodities such as corn, cocoa, soybean
meal, soybean oil and wheat. At July 31, 2005 and August
1, 2004, the notional values and unrealized gains or
losses on commodity futures contracts held by the company
were not material.

The information below summarizes the company’s market
risks associated with debt obligations and other
significant financial instruments as of July 31, 2005.
Fair values included herein have been determined based on
quoted market prices. The information presented below
should be read in conjunction with Notes 16 and 18 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The table below presents principal cash flows and related
interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt
obligations. Variable interest rates disclosed represent
the weighted-average rates of the portfolio at the period
end. Notional amounts and related interest rates of
interest rate swaps are presented by fiscal year of
maturity. For the swaps, variable rates are the
weighted-average forward rates for the term of each
contract.

As of August 1, 2004, fixed-rate debt of approximately $2.5 billion with an average interest rate
of 6.17% and variable-rate debt of approximately $1 billion with an average interest rate of 3.30%
were outstanding. As of August 1, 2004, the company had also swapped $875 million of fixed-rate
debt to variable. The average rate received on these swaps was 5.42% and the average rate paid was
estimated to be 5.21% over the remaining life of the swaps.



The company is exposed to foreign exchange risk
related to its international operations, including
non-functional currency intercompany debt and net
investments in subsidiaries.

The table below summarizes the cross-currency swaps
outstanding as of July 31, 2005, which hedge such

these swap contracts was $1 billion as of August 1, 2004
and the
aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was $(154)
million as of August 1, 2004.

The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk
as a result of transactions in currencies other than the
functional currency of certain subsidiaries, including
subsidiary debt. The company utilizes foreign exchange
forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these
exposures. The table below summarizes the foreign
exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related

The company had an additional $8 million in a
number of smaller contracts to purchase or sell various
other currencies, such as the Australian dollar, euro,
New Zealand dollar, Japanese yen, Swedish krona and
Swiss franc as of July 31, 2005. The aggregate fair
value of all contracts was $3 million as of July 31,
2005. Total forward exchange contracts outstanding as
of August 1, 2004 were $255 million with a fair value
of $2 million.



The company had swap contracts outstanding as of July
31, 2005, which hedge a portion of exposures relating to
certain employee compensation obligations linked to the
total return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the
total return of the company’s capital stock and beginning
in February 2005, the total return of the Puritan Fund.
Under these contracts, the company pays variable interest
rates and receives from the counterparty either the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index total return, the Puritan
Fund total return, or the total return on company capital
stock. The notional value of the contracts that are
linked to the return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
was $20 million at July 31, 2005 and $21 million at
August 1, 2004. The average forward interest rate
applicable to the contract, which expires in 2006, was
4.02% at July 31, 2005. The notional value of the
contract that is linked to the return on
the Puritan Fund was $9 million at July 31, 2005. The
average forward interest rate applicable to the contract,
which expires in 2006, was 4.38% at July 31, 2005. The
notional value of the contract that is linked to the
total return on company capital stock was $20 million at
July 31, 2005 and $13 million at August 1, 2004. The
average forward interest rate applicable to this
contract, which expires in 2006, was 4.43% at July 31,
2005. The fair value of these contracts was a $1 million
gain at both July 31, 2005 and August 1, 2004.

The company’s utilization of financial instruments in
managing market risk exposures described above is
consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio
of financial instruments are a function of the results of
operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market
effects on debt and foreign currency, and the company’s
acquisition and divestiture activities.

Significant Accounting Estimates

The consolidated financial statements of the company
are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires the use of
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results
could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of significant accounting policies. The
following areas all require the use of subjective or
complex judgments, estimates and assumptions:

Trade and consumer promotion programs

The company offers
various sales incentive programs to customers and
consumers, such as cooperative advertising programs,
feature price discounts, in-store display incentives and
coupons. The recognition of the costs for these programs,
which are classified as a reduction of revenue, involves
use of judgment related to performance and

redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on
historical experience and other factors. Actual expenses
may differ if the level of redemption rates and
performance vary from estimates.

Valuation of long-lived assets

Long-lived assets,
including fixed assets and intangibles, are reviewed for
impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur
indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not
be recoverable. Discounted cash flow analyses are used to
assess nonamortizable intangible asset impairment, while
undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess other
long-lived asset impairment. The estimates of future cash
flows involve considerable management judgment and are
based upon assumptions about expected future operating
performance. Assumptions used in these forecasts are
consistent with internal planning. The actual cash flows
could differ from management’s estimates due to changes
in business conditions, operating performance, and
economic conditions.

Pension and postretirement medical benefits

The company
provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to
employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated
with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial
assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on
plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and
health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States, perform the required calculations
to determine expense. Actual results that differ from the
actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and
amortized over future periods.

The discount rate is established as of the company’s
fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the
discount rate, the company reviews published market
indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as
appropriate for duration. In addition, independent
financial consultants apply high-quality bond yield
curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The
expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption
based upon historical experience and expected future
performance, considering the company’s current and
projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an
estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real
returns for each asset class, and a premium for active
management. Within any given fiscal period, significant
differences may arise between the actual return and the
expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets,
used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined
on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the
difference between the actual fair value of assets and
the expected calculated method. Gains and losses
resulting from differences between actual experience and
the assumptions are determined at each measurement date.
If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of
plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized into
earnings in the following year.



When the fair value of pension plan assets is less
than the accumulated benefit obligation, an additional
minimum liability is recorded in Other comprehensive
income within Shareowners’ Equity. As of July 31, 2005
and August 1, 2004, Shareowners’ Equity includes a
minimum liability, net of tax, of $238 million and $196
million, respectively.

Net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense
was $67 million in 2005, $65 million in 2004, and $43
million in 2003. The increase in 2004 was primarily due
to a lower discount rate and a reduction in the expected
return on assets, partially offset by the expected
returns associated with a $50 million voluntary
contribution to a U.S. plan. Significant weighted-average
assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows:

Pension

Estimated sensitivities to the net periodic pension
cost are as follows: a 50 basis point reduction in the
discount rate would increase expense by approximately $12
million; a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated
return on assets assumption would increase expense by
approximately $8 million. A one percentage point change
in assumed health care costs would increase
postretirement service and interest cost by
approximately $2 million.

Although there were no mandatory funding requirements to
the U.S. plans in 2005 and 2004, the company made $35 million and $50 million contributions, respectively, to a
U.S. plan based on expected future funding requirements.
Contributions to international plans were $26 million in
2005 and $15 million in 2004. In 2003, there were no
contributions to the U.S. plans and contributions to
international plans were $19 million. Subsequent to July
31, 2005, the company made a $35 million voluntary
contribution to a U.S. plan in anticipation of future
funding requirements.

See also Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on pension and postretirement
medical expenses.

Income taxes

The effective tax rate reflects statutory
tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the
various jurisdictions in which the company operates and
management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various
tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required
in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating
tax positions. Tax reserves are established when,

despite the company’s belief that tax return positions
are fully supportable, certain positions are subject to
challenge and the company may not successfully defend its
position. These reserves, as well as the related
interest, are adjusted in light of changing facts and
circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. While
it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of
resolution of any particular tax matter, the company
believes that the reserves reflect the probable outcome
of known tax contingencies. Income taxes are recorded
based on amounts refundable or payable in the current
year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
impact of differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation
allowances are established for deferred tax assets when
it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be
realized. See also the section entitled
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Notes 1 and
10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion on income taxes, including the impact of the
American Jobs Creation Act (the AJCA).

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was
signed into law. The Act introduced a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare Part D and a federal subsidy to
sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a
benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare Part D. In accordance with FASB Staff Position
(FSP) FAS 106-1, the company elected in January 2004 to
defer recognizing the effects of the Act on accounting
for postretirement health care plans until the FASB
guidance was finalized.

In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued FSP FAS 106-2, which provides accounting
guidance to sponsors of postretirement health care plans
that are impacted by the Act. The FSP is effective for
interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2004.
The company believes that certain drug benefits offered
under postretirement health care plans will qualify for
the subsidy under Medicare Part D. The effects of the
subsidy were factored into the 2004 annual year-end
valuation. The reduction in the benefit obligation
attributable to past service cost was approximately $32
million and has been reflected as an actuarial gain. The
reduction in benefit cost for 2005 related to the Act was
approximately $5 million.



In November 2004, SFAS No. 151 “Inventory Costs — an
amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4” was issued. SFAS No.
151 is the result of efforts to converge U.S. accounting
standards for inventories with International Accounting
Standards. SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage to
be recognized as current-period charges. It also requires
that allocation of fixed production overheads to the
costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of
the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective
for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005. The company does not
expect the adoption to have a material impact on the
financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R (revised
2004) “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123R requires
employee stock-based compensation to be measured based on
the grant-date fair value of the awards and the cost to
be recognized over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award.
The Statement eliminates the alternative use of
Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25’s intrinsic
value method of accounting for awards, which is the
company’s accounting policy for stock options. See Note 1
to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for the pro forma impact of
compensation expense from stock options on net earnings
and earnings per share. SFAS No. 123R is effective for
the beginning of fiscal 2006. The company will adopt the
provisions of SFAS No. 123R on a prospective basis. The
financial statement impact will be dependent on future
stock-based awards and any unvested stock options
outstanding at the date of adoption.

In October 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA
provides for a deduction of 85% of certain foreign
earnings that are repatriated, as defined by the AJCA,
and a phased-in tax deduction related to profits from
domestic manufacturing activities. In December 2004, the
FASB issued FSP FAS 109-1 and 109-2 to address the
accounting and disclosure requirements related to the
AJCA. The company is currently evaluating the impact of
the AJCA along with the additional technical guidance
issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. The company will
complete its evaluation in fiscal 2006. The company
estimates the range of possible amounts considered for
repatriation to be between $200 and $425 million and the
related impact on income tax to be between $7 and $16
million. Based on the company’s plans related to the AJCA
as of 2005, tax expense of $7 million has been recorded
for amounts expected to be repatriated.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47
(FIN 47) “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.
143.” This Interpretation clarifies that a conditional
retirement obligation refers to a legal

obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in
which the timing and (or) method of settlement are
conditional on a future event that may or may not be
within the control of the entity. The obligation to
perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional
even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or)
method of settlement. Accordingly, an entity is required
to recognize a liability for the fair value of a
conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value
of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The
liability should be recognized when incurred, generally
upon acquisition, construction or development of the
asset. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of the
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The company
is in the process of evaluating the impact of FIN 47 but
does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on
the financial statements.

Earnings Outlook

On September 12, 2005, the company issued a press
release announcing results for 2005 and commented on the
outlook for earnings per share for 2006.

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results

This Report contains “forward-looking” statements
that reflect the company’s current expectations regarding
future results of operations, economic performance,
financial condition and achievements of the company. The
company tries, wherever possible, to identify these
forward-looking statements by using words such as
“anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “will”
and similar expressions. One can also identify them by
the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical
or current facts. These statements reflect the company’s
current plans and expectations and are based on
information currently available to it. They rely on a
number of assumptions regarding future events and
estimates which could be inaccurate and which are
inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.

The company wishes to caution the reader that the
following important factors and those important factors
described elsewhere in the commentary, or in the
Securities and Exchange Commission filings of the
company, could affect the company’s actual results and
could cause such results to vary materially from those
expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of, the company:

•

the impact of strong competitive response to the
company’s efforts to leverage its brand power with
product innovation, promotional programs and new
advertising, and of changes in consumer demand for the
company’s products;



This discussion of uncertainties is by no means
exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors
that may impact the company’s outlook. The company
disclaims any obligation or intent to update
forward-looking statements made by the company in order
to reflect new information, events or circumstances after
the date they are made.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)


Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the company and its
majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions
are eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior
year financial statements were reclassified to conform to
the current presentation.

The company’s fiscal
year ends on the Sunday nearest

July
31.

There were 52 weeks in 2005 and 2004, and 53 weeks in
2003.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues are recognized when the
earnings process is complete. This occurs when products
are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements, title
and risk of loss transfer to customers, collection is
probable and pricing is fixed or determinable. Revenues
are recognized net of provisions for returns, discounts
and allowances. Certain sales promotion expenses, such as
coupon redemption costs, cooperative advertising
programs, new product introduction fees, feature price
discounts and in-store display incentives are classified
as a reduction of sales.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or
less are classified as cash equivalents.

Inventories

Substantially all U.S. inventories are priced
at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined by
the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Other inventories
are priced at the lower of average cost or market.

In November 2004, Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 151 “Inventory Costs — an amendment
of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4” was issued. SFAS No. 151 is the
result of efforts to converge U.S. accounting standards
for inventories with International Accounting Standards.
SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage to be
recognized as current-period charges. It also requires
that allocation of fixed production overheads to the
costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of
the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective
for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005. The company does not
expect the adoption to have a material impact on the
financial statements.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and
equipment are recorded at historical cost and are
depreciated over estimated useful lives using the
straight-line method. Buildings and machinery and equipment are depreciated
over periods not exceeding 45 years and 15 years,
respectively. Assets are evaluated for impairment when
triggering events occur.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but
rather are tested at least annually for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” Intangible assets with finite lives
are amortized over the estimated useful life and reviewed
for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived
Assets.” Goodwill impairment testing first requires a
comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to
the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds fair
value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of
impairment is the difference between the carrying value
of goodwill and the “implied” fair value, which is
calculated as if the reporting unit had just been
acquired and accounted for as a business combination.
Impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets
requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying
value of the asset. If carrying value exceeds the fair
value, the asset is reduced to fair value. Fair values
are primarily determined using discounted cash flow
analyses. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for information on goodwill and
other intangible assets.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The company uses
derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes
of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates,
foreign currency exchange rates, commodities and
equity-linked employee benefit obligations. All
derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair
value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are
recorded in earnings or other comprehensive income, based
on whether the instrument is designated as part of a
hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge
transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments
reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified
to earnings in the period in which earnings are affected
by the underlying hedged item. The ineffective portion of
all hedges is recognized in earnings in the current
period. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.



Stock-Based Compensation

The company accounts for
stock option grants and restricted stock awards in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion
No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and
related Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized for stock options since all
options granted had an exercise price equal to the market
value of the underlying stock on the grant date.
Restricted stock awards are expensed. See also Note 19 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
following table illustrates the effect on net earnings
and earnings per share if the company had applied the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to
stock-based employee compensation.

The weighted average fair value of options granted in
2005, 2004 and 2003 was estimated as $4.74, $5.73 and
$5.91, respectively. The fair value of each option grant
at grant date is estimated using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions
were used for grants in 2005, 2004 and 2003:

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R (revised 2004)
“Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123R requires employee
stock-based

compensation to be measured based on the grant-date fair
value of the awards and the cost to be recognized over
the period during which an employee is required to
provide service in exchange for the award. The Statement
eliminates the alternative use of APB No. 25’s intrinsic
value method of accounting for awards. SFAS No. 123R is
effective for the beginning of fiscal 2006. The company
will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R on a
prospective basis. The financial statement impact will be
dependent on future stock-based awards and any unvested
stock options outstanding at the date of adoption.

Use of Estimates

Generally accepted accounting principles
require management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect assets and liabilities, contingent assets and
liabilities,
and revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for in accordance
with SFAS No. 109 “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
impact of differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are
recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more
likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (the
AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA provides for a
deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated, as defined by the AJCA, and a phased-in tax
deduction related to profits from domestic manufacturing
activities. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position (FSP) FAS 109-1 and 109-2 to address the
accounting and disclosure requirements related to the
AJCA. The company is currently evaluating the impact of
the AJCA along with the additional technical guidance
issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. The company will
complete its evaluation in fiscal 2006. The company
estimates the range of possible amounts considered for
repatriation to be between $200 and $425 and the related
impact on income tax to be between $7 and $16. Based on
the company’s plans related to the AJCA as of 2005, tax
expense of $7 has been recorded for amounts expected to
be repatriated.



Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December
2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law.
The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare Part D and a federal subsidy to sponsors of
retirement health care plans that provide a benefit that
is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In
accordance with FSP FAS 106-1, the company elected in
January 2004 to defer recognizing the effects of the Act
on accounting for postretirement health care plans until
the FASB guidance was finalized.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106-2, which
provides accounting guidance to sponsors of
postretirement health care plans that are impacted by the
Act. The FSP is effective for interim or annual periods
beginning after June 15, 2004. The company believes that
certain drug benefits offered under postretirement health
care plans will qualify for the subsidy under Medicare
Part D. The effects of the subsidy were factored into the
2004 annual year-end valuation. The reduction in the
benefit obligation attributable to past service cost was
approximately $32 and was reflected as an actuarial
gain. The reduction in benefit cost for 2005 related to
the Act was approximately $5.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47
(FIN 47) “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.
143.” This Interpretation clarifies that a conditional
retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to
perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing
and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future
event that may or may not be within the control of the
entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement
activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists
about the timing and (or) method of settlement.
Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a
liability for the fair value of a conditional asset
retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability
can be reasonably estimated. The liability should be
recognized when incurred, generally upon acquisition,
construction or development of the asset. FIN 47 is
effective no later than the end of the fiscal years
ending after December 15, 2005. The company is in the
process of evaluating the impact of FIN 47 but does not
expect the adoption to have a material impact on the
financial statements.


Comprehensive Income

Total comprehensive income is comprised of net
earnings, net foreign currency translation adjustments,
minimum pension liability adjustments (see Note 9), and
net unrealized gains and losses on cash-flow hedges.
Total comprehensive income for the twelve months ended
July 31, 2005, August 1, 2004 and August 3, 2003 was
$688, $759 and $760, respectively.

The components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss,
as reflected in the Statements of Shareowners’ Equity
(Deficit), consisted of the following:

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

In 2003, the company adopted SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets.” In connection with the
adoption, the company recorded a cumulative effect of
accounting change of $31 (net of a $17 tax benefit), or
$.08 per share in 2003, for impaired goodwill associated
with the Stockpot business, a food service business
acquired in August 1998. Stockpot is a reporting unit
within Other in the segment reporting. The impairment of
Stockpot goodwill was the result of a reduction in actual
sales attained and forecasted future sales growth
relative to projections made at the time of the
acquisition.

Business and Geographic Segment Information

Campbell Soup Company, together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, is a global manufacturer and marketer of
high quality, branded convenience food products. Through
fiscal 2004, the company was organized and reported the
results of operations in four segments: North America
Soup and Away From Home, North America Sauces and
Beverages, Biscuits and Confectionery, and International
Soup and Sauces.

As of fiscal 2005, the company changed its organizational
structure and as a result reports the following segments:
U.S. Soup,

Sauces and Beverages, Baking and Snacking, International
Soup and Sauces, and Other. Comparative periods have been
restated to conform to the current year presentation. The
restatements also reflect a reallocation of certain
expenses between corporate and the operating segments.

The U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment includes the
following retail businesses:

Campbell’s

condensed and
ready-to-serve soups;

Swanson

broth and canned poultry;

Prego

pasta sauce;

Pace

Mexican sauce;

Campbell’s Chunky

chili;

Campbell’s

canned pasta, gravies and beans;

Campbell’s Supper Bakes

meal kits;

V8

vegetable juice;

V8
Splash

juice beverages; and

Campbell’s

tomato juice.

The Baking and Snacking segment includes the following
businesses:

Pepperidge Farm

cookies, crackers, bakery and
frozen products in U.S. retail;

Arnott’s

biscuits in
Australia and Asia Pacific; and

Arnott’s

salty snacks in
Australia.

The International Soup and Sauces segment includes the
soup, sauce and beverage businesses outside of the United
States, including Europe, Mexico, Latin America, the Asia
Pacific region and the retail business in Canada.

The balance of the portfolio reported in Other includes
Godiva Chocolatier worldwide and the company’s Away From
Home operations, which represent the distribution of
products such as soup, specialty entrees, beverage
products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm
products through various food service channels in the
United States and Canada.

Accounting policies for measuring segment assets and
earnings before interest and taxes are substantially
consistent with those described in Note 1. The company
evaluates segment performance before interest and taxes.
Away From Home products are principally produced by the
tangible assets of the company’s other segments, except
for Stockpot soups, which are produced in a separate
facility, and certain other products, which are produced
under contract manufacturing agreements. Accordingly, with
the exception of the designated Stockpot facility, plant
assets are not allocated to the Away From Home operations.
Depreciation, however, is allocated to Away From Home
based on production hours.

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and
its affiliates, accounted for approximately 14% of
consolidated net sales in 2005 and 12% during 2004 and
2003. All of the company’s segments sold products to
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates.

Transfers between geographic areas are recorded at

those assets, including goodwill, which are identified
with the operations in each geographic region. The
restructuring charge of $32 in 2004 was allocated to the
geographic regions as follows: United States — $12,
Europe — $9, Australia/Asia Pacific — $10, and Other
countries — $1.




Restructuring Program

A restructuring charge of $32 ($22 after tax) was
recorded in the fourth quarter 2004 for severance and
employee benefit costs associated with a worldwide
reduction in workforce and with the implementation of a
distribution and logistics realignment in Australia.
These programs are part of cost savings initiatives
designed to improve the company’s operating margins and
asset utilization. Approximately 400 positions were
eliminated under the reduction in workforce program,
resulting in a restructuring charge of $23. The
reductions represented the elimination of layers of
management, elimination of redundant positions due to the
realignment of operations in North America, and
reorganization of the U.S. sales force. The majority of
the terminations occurred in the fourth quarter of 2004.

The distribution and logistics realignment in Australia
involves the conversion of a direct store delivery system
to a central warehouse system. As a result of this
program, over 200 positions will be eliminated due to the
outsourcing of the infrastructure. A restructuring charge
of $9 was recorded for this program. The majority of the
terminations occurred in 2005.

approximately $9. These brands are included in the Baking
and Snacking segment.

In the first quarter 2003, the company acquired two
businesses for cash consideration of approximately $170
and assumed debt of approximately $20. The company
acquired Snack
Foods Limited, a leader in the Australian salty snack
category, and Erin Foods, the number two dry soup
manufacturer in Ireland. Snack Foods Limited is included
in the Baking and Snacking segment. Erin Foods is included
in the International Soup and Sauces segment. The
businesses have annual sales of approximately $160.


Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

Substantially all of the company’s
U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees are covered by
noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. In 1999,
the company implemented significant amendments to certain
U.S. plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are
determined based on percentages of annual pay and age. To
minimize the impact of converting to the new formula,
service and earnings credit continues to accrue for
active employees participating in the plans under the
formula prior to the amendments through the year 2014.
Employees will receive the benefit from either the new or
old formula, whichever is higher. Benefits become vested
upon the completion of five years of service. Benefits
are paid from funds previously provided to trustees and
insurance companies or are paid directly by the



company from general funds. Plan assets consist
primarily of investments in equities, fixed income
securities and real estate.

Postretirement Benefits

The company provides
postretirement benefits including health care and life
insurance to substantially all retired U.S. employees and
their dependents. In 1999, changes were made to the
postretirement benefits offered to certain U.S.
employees. Participants who were not receiving
postretirement benefits as of May 1, 1999 will no longer
be eligible to receive such benefits in the future, but
the company will provide access to health care coverage
for non-eligible future retirees on a group basis. Costs
will be paid by the participants. To preserve the
economic benefits for employees near retirement,
participants who were at least age 55 and had at least 10
years of continuous service remain eligible for
postretirement benefits.

In 2005, the company established retiree medical account
benefits for eligible U.S. retirees, intended to provide
reimbursement for eligible health care expenses.

The company uses the fiscal year end as the measurement
date for the benefit plans.

global plans is a weighted average of the expected rates
of return selected for the various countries where the
company has funded pension plans. These rates of return
are set annually and are based upon the long-term
historical investment performance of the plans and an

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was
signed into law. The Act introduced a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare Part D and a federal subsidy to
sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a
benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare Part D. The effects of the Act were reflected in
the 2004 valuation. See also Note 1 to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Obligations related to non-U.S. postretirement benefit
plans are not significant, since these benefits are
generally provided through government-sponsored plans.

The fundamental goal underlying the pension plans’
investment policy is to ensure that the assets of the
plans are invested in a prudent manner to meet the
obligations of the plans as these obligations come due.
Investment practices must comply with
applicable laws and regulations.



The company’s investment strategy is based on an
expectation that equity securities will outperform debt
securities over the long term. Accordingly, in order to
maximize the return on assets, a majority of assets are
invested in equities. Additional asset classes with
dissimilar expected rates of return, return volatility,
and correlations of returns are utilized to reduce risk
by providing diversification relative to equities.
Investments within each asset class are also diversified
to further reduce the impact of losses in single
investments. The use of derivative instruments is
permitted where appropriate and necessary to achieve
overall investment policy objectives and asset class
targets.

The company establishes strategic asset allocation
percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for each
significant asset class to obtain a prudent balance
between return and risk. The interaction between plan
assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied to
assist in the establishment of strategic asset allocation
targets.

Estimated future Medicare subsidy receipts are $1-$2
annually from 2006 through 2010, and $14 for the period
2011 through 2015.

The company made a voluntary contribution of $35 to a
U.S. pension plan subsequent to July 31, 2005. The
company is not required to make additional contributions
to the U.S. plans in 2006. Contributions to non-U.S.
plans are expected to be approximately $17 in 2006.

Savings Plan

The company sponsors employee savings plans
which cover substantially all U.S. employees. After one
year of continuous service, the company historically
matched 50% of employee contributions up to 5% of
compensation. Effective January 1, 2004, the company
increased the amount of matching contribution from 50% to
60% of the employee contributions. Amounts charged to
Costs and expenses were
$14 in 2005 and 2004 and $11 in 2003.

At July 31, 2005, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company
have tax loss carryforwards of approximately $75. Of these
carryforwards, $3 expire through 2010 and $72 may be
carried forward indefinitely. The current statutory tax
rates in these countries range from 13% to 39%.

The company has undistributed earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries of approximately $590. Of this amount, the
company intends to repatriate approximately $200 in 2006
under the AJCA and has provided tax expense of $7. See
also Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on the AJCA. U.S. income taxes have
not been provided on the remaining $390 of undistributed
earnings, which are deemed to be permanently reinvested.
If remitted, tax credits or planning strategies should
substantially offset any resulting tax liability.

The deferred compensation plan is an unfunded plan
maintained for the purpose of providing the company’s
directors and certain of its executives the opportunity
to defer a portion of their compensation. All forms of
compensation contributed to the deferred compensation
plan are accounted for in accordance with the underlying
program. Contributions are credited to an investment
account in the participant’s name, although no funds are
actually contributed to the investment account and no
investment choices are actually purchased. Four
investment choices are available, including:
(1) a book account which tracks the total return on
company stock; (2) a book account that tracks performance
of Fidelity’s Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund; (3) a book
account which tracks the performance of Fidelity’s
Puritan Fund; and (4) a book account that credits
interest based on the Wall Street Journal indexed prime
rate. Participants can reallocate investments daily and
are entitled to the gains and losses on investment funds.
The company recognizes an amount in the Statements of
Earnings for the market appreciation/ depreciation of each
fund, as appropriate.


Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable and
short-term debt approximate fair value. The fair values
of long-term debt, as indicated in Note 16, and
derivative financial instruments are based on quoted
market prices.

In 2001, the company adopted SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” as amended
by SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149. The standard requires
that all



derivative instruments be recorded on the balance
sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for
designation and effectiveness of the hedging
relationships.

The company utilizes certain derivative financial
instruments to enhance its ability to manage risk,
including interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and
certain equity-linked employee compensation exposures
that exist as part of ongoing business operations.
Derivative instruments are entered into for periods
consistent with related underlying exposures and do not
constitute positions independent of those exposures. The
company does not enter into contracts for speculative
purposes, nor is it a party to any leveraged derivative
instrument.

The company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties on derivative
contracts. The company minimizes its credit risk on these
transactions by dealing only with leading, credit-worthy
financial institutions having long-term credit ratings of
“A” or better and, therefore, does not anticipate
nonperformance. In addition, the contracts are
distributed among several financial institutions, thus
minimizing credit risk concentration.

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at
fair value. On the date the derivative contract is
entered into, the company designates the derivative as
(1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or
liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment
(fair-value hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted
transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be
received or paid related to a recognized asset or
liability (cash-flow hedge), (3) a foreign-currency
fair-value or cash-flow hedge (foreign-currency hedge),
or (4) a hedge of a net
investment in a foreign operation. Some derivatives may
also be considered natural hedging instruments (changes
in fair value are recognized to act as economic offsets
to changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item
and do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No.
133).

Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along
with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability
that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses
or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in current
period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a cash-flow
hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income, until
earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
Changes in the fair value of a foreign-currency hedge are
recorded in either current period earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether the hedge
transaction is a fair-value hedge (e.g., a hedge of a
firm commitment that is to be

settled in foreign currency) or a cash-flow hedge (e.g.,
a hedge of a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted
transaction). If, however, a derivative is used as a
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its
changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a
hedge, are recorded in the cumulative translation
adjustments account within Shareowners’ equity (deficit).

The company finances a portion of its operations through
debt instruments primarily consisting of commercial
paper, notes, debentures and bank loans. The company
utilizes interest rate swap agreements to minimize
worldwide financing costs and to achieve a targeted ratio
of variable-rate versus fixed-rate debt.

There were no changes made to the company’s interest rate
swap portfolio in 2005.

In September 2003, the company entered into ten-year
interest rate swaps that converted $200 of the 4.875%
fixed-rate notes issued during that month to variable.
The company also entered into $100 of five-year interest
rate swaps that converted a portion of the 5.875%
fixed-rate notes due October 2008 to variable.

In April 2004, the company entered into a $50 interest
rate swap that converted a portion of the 6.9% fixed-rate
notes due October 2006 to variable.

In May 2004, the company entered into a $50 interest rate
swap that converted a portion of the 6.9% fixed-rate
notes due October 2006 to variable.

In November 2002, the company terminated interest rate
swap contracts with a notional value of $250 that
converted fixed-rate debt (6.75% notes due 2011) to
variable and received $37. Of this amount, $3 represented
accrued interest earned on the swap prior to the
termination date. The remainder of $34 is being amortized
over the remaining life of the notes as a reduction to
interest expense. The company also entered into ten-year
interest rate swaps that converted $300 of ten-year 5%
fixed-rate notes issued in November 2002 to variable.

Fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps are accounted for
as fair-value hedges. Gains and losses on these
instruments are recorded in earnings as adjustments to
interest expense, offsetting gains and losses on the
hedged item. The notional amount of fair-value interest
rate swaps was $875 at both July 31, 2005 and August 1,
2004. The swaps had a fair value of $(2) at July 31, 2005
and a minimal fair value at August 1, 2004.



The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange
risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than
the functional currency of certain subsidiaries,
including subsidiary financing transactions. The company
utilizes foreign currency forward purchase and sale
contracts, options and cross-currency swaps in order to
manage the volatility associated with foreign currency
purchases and sales and certain intercompany transactions
in the normal course of business.

Qualifying foreign exchange forward and cross-currency
swap contracts are accounted for as cash-flow hedges when
the hedged item is a forecasted transaction, or when
future cash flows related to a recognized asset or
liability are expected to be received or paid. The
effective portion of the changes in fair value on these
instruments is recorded in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into the
Statements of Earnings on the same line item and in the
same period or periods in which the hedged transaction
affects earnings. The assessment of effectiveness for
contracts is based on changes in spot rates. The fair
value of these instruments was $(157) at July 31, 2005.

Qualifying foreign exchange forward contracts are
accounted for as fair-value hedges when the hedged item
is a recognized asset, liability or firm commitment. The
fair value of such contracts was not material at July 31,
2005.

The company also enters into certain foreign exchange
forward contracts and variable-to-variable cross-currency
swap contracts that are not designated as accounting
hedges. These instruments are primarily intended to
reduce volatility of certain intercompany financing
transactions. Gains and losses on derivatives not
designated as accounting hedges are typically recorded in
Other expenses/(income), as an offset to gains (losses)
on the underlying transactions. The fair value of these
instruments was $(8) at July 31, 2005.

Foreign exchange forward contracts typically have
maturities of less than eighteen months. Principal
currencies include the Australian dollar, British pound,
Canadian dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso and
Swedish krona.

As of July 31, 2005, the accumulated derivative net loss
in other comprehensive income for cash-flow hedges,
including the foreign exchange forward and cross-currency
contracts, forward-starting swap contracts and treasury
lock agreements, was $20, net of tax. As of August 1,
2004, the accumulated
derivative net loss in other comprehensive income for
cash-flow hedges was $1, net of tax. Reclassifications
from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into
the Statements of Earnings during the period ended July
31, 2005 were not material. There were no discontinued
cash-flow hedges during the year. At July 31, 2005, the
maximum maturity date of any cash-flow hedge was
approximately eight years.

Other disclosures related to hedge ineffectiveness, gains
(losses) excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness, gains (losses) arising from effective
hedges of net investments, gains (losses) resulting from
the discontinuance of hedge accounting and
reclassifications from other comprehensive income to
earnings have been omitted due to the insignificance of
these amounts.

The company principally uses a combination of purchase
orders and various short- and long-term supply
arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw
materials, including certain commodities and agricultural
products. The company may also enter into commodity
futures contracts, as considered appropriate, to reduce
the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities such
as corn, cocoa, soybean meal, soybean oil and wheat. As
of July 31, 2005, the notional values and the fair values
of open contracts related to commodity hedging activity
were not material.

The company is exposed to equity price changes related to
certain employee compensation obligations. Swap contracts
are utilized to hedge exposures relating to certain
employee compensation obligations linked to the total
return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the total
return of the company’s capital stock and the total
return of the Puritan Fund. The company pays a variable
interest rate and receives the equity returns under these
instruments. The notional value of the equity swap
contracts, which mature in 2006, was $49 at July 31,
2005. These instruments are not designated as accounting
hedges. Gains and losses are recorded in the Statements
of Earnings. The net asset recorded under these contracts
at July 31, 2005 was approximately $1.




Shareowners’ Equity (Deficit)

The company has authorized 560 million shares of
Capital stock with $.0375 par value and 40 million shares
of Preferred stock, issuable in one or more classes, with
or without par as may be authorized by the Board of
Directors. No Preferred stock has been issued.

The company sponsors a long-term incentive compensation
plan. Under the plan, restricted stock and options may be
granted to certain officers and key employees of the
company. The plan provides for future awards of
approximately 20 million shares of Capital stock,
although this amount may increase upon the lapse,
expiration or termination of previously issued
awards. Options are granted at a price not less than the
fair value of the shares on the date of grant and expire
not later than ten years after the date of grant. Options
vest over a three-year period. See also Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on accounting for stock-based compensation,
including the pro forma impact if the company applied the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123.

In 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the conversion
of certain stock options to shares of restricted stock
based on specified conversion ratios. The exchange, which
was voluntary, replaced approximately 4.7 million options
with approximately one million restricted shares.
Depending on the original grant date of the options, the
restricted shares vested in 2002, 2003 or 2004. The
company recognized compensation expense throughout the
vesting period of the restricted stock. Compensation
expense related to this award was $3 in 2004 and $6 in
2003.

For the periods presented in the Consolidated
Statements of Earnings, the calculations of basic
earnings per share and earnings per share assuming
dilution vary in that the weighted average shares
outstanding assuming dilution includes the incremental
effect of stock options and restricted stock programs,
except when such effect would be antidilutive. Stock
options to purchase 10 million shares of capital stock
for 2005 and 26 million shares of capital stock for 2004
and 2003 were not included in the calculation of diluted
earnings per share because the exercise price of the
stock options exceeded the average market price of the
capital stock and, therefore, would be antidilutive.




Commitments and Contingencies

On March 30, 1998, the company effected a spinoff of
several of its non-core businesses to Vlasic Foods
International Inc. (VFI). VFI and several of its
affiliates (collectively, Vlasic) commenced cases under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 29, 2001 in
the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware. Vlasic’s Second Amended Joint Plan of
Distribution under Chapter 11 (the Plan) was confirmed by
an order of the Bankruptcy Court dated November 16, 2001,
and became effective on or about November 29, 2001. The
Plan provides for the assignment of various causes of
action allegedly belonging to the Vlasic estates,
including claims against the company allegedly arising
from the spinoff, to VFB L.L.C., a limited liability
company (VFB) whose membership interests are to be
distributed under the Plan to Vlasic’s general unsecured
creditors.

On February 19, 2002, VFB commenced a lawsuit against the
company and several of its subsidiaries in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware
alleging, among other things, fraudulent conveyance,
illegal dividends and breaches of fiduciary duty by
Vlasic directors alleged to be under the company’s
control. The lawsuit seeks to hold the company liable in
an amount necessary to satisfy all unpaid claims against
Vlasic (which VFB estimates in the amended complaint to
be $200), plus unspecified exemplary and punitive
damages.

Following a trial on the merits, on September 13, 2005,
the District Court issued Post-Trial Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of Law, ruling in favor of the company and
against VFB on all claims. The Court ruled that VFB
failed to prove that the spinoff was a constructive or
actual fraudulent transfer. The Court also rejected VFB’s
claim of breach of fiduciary duty, VFB’s claim that VFI
was an alter ego of the company, and VFB’s claim that the
spinoff should be deemed an illegal dividend. VFB will
have 30 days following the entry of the judgment of the
District Court to appeal the decision.

The company received an Examination Report from the
Internal Revenue Service on December 23, 2002, which
included a challenge to the treatment of gains and
interest
deductions claimed in the company’s fiscal 1995 federal
income tax return, relating to transactions involving
government securities. If the proposed adjustment were
upheld, it would require the company to pay a

net amount of approximately $100 in taxes, accumulated
interest as of December 23, 2002, and penalties. Interest
will continue to accrue until the matter is resolved. The
company believes these transactions were properly
reported on its federal income tax return in accordance
with applicable tax laws and regulations in effect during
the period involved and is challenging these adjustments
vigorously. The company expects a final resolution of
this matter in 2006.

The company is a party to other legal proceedings and
claims, tax issues and environmental matters arising out
of the normal course of business.

Management assesses the probability of loss for all legal
proceedings and claims, tax issues and environmental
matters and has recognized liabilities for such
contingencies, as appropriate. Although the results of
these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in
management’s opinion, the final outcome of legal
proceedings and claims, tax issues and environmental
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated results of operations or financial condition
of the company.

The company has certain operating lease commitments,
primarily related to warehouse and office facilities,
retail store space and certain equipment. Rent expense
under operating lease commitments was $84 in 2005, $79 in
2004 and $66 in 2003. Future minimum annual rental
payments under these operating leases are as follows:






Thereafter

$68

$59

$48

$37

$34

$51

The company guarantees approximately 1,400 bank loans
made to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by
third party financial institutions for the purchase of
distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of
future payments the company could be required to make
under the guarantees is $112. The company’s guarantees
are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. The
company does not believe it is probable that it will be
required to make guarantee payments as a result of
defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. The amounts
recognized as of July 31, 2005 and August 1, 2004 were
not material.

The company has provided certain standard
indemnifications in connection with divestitures,
contracts and other transactions. Certain
indemnifications have finite expiration dates.
Liabilities recognized based on known exposures related
to such matters were not material at July 31, 2005.

Reports of Management

Management’s Report on Financial Statements

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared by the company’s management in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles to reflect the
financial position of the company and its operating
results. The financial information appearing throughout
this Annual Report is consistent with the financial
statements. Management is responsible for the information
and representations in such financial statements,
including the estimates and judgments required for their
preparation. The financial statements have been audited
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which
appears herein.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is
composed entirely of Directors who are not officers or
employees of the company, meets regularly with the
company’s worldwide internal auditing department, other
management personnel, and the independent auditors. The
independent auditors and the internal auditing department
have had, and continue to have, direct access to the
Audit Committee without the presence of other management
personnel, and have been directed to discuss the results
of their audit work and any matters they believe should
be brought to the Committee’s attention. The internal
auditing department and the independent auditors report
directly to the Audit Committee.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control Over

Financial Reporting

The company’s management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America.

The company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and Directors of the
company; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of
the company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of July 31, 2005. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

. Based
on this assessment using those criteria, management
concluded that the company’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2005.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
July 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report, which appears herein.

Report of Independent
Registered Public

Accounting Firm To the
Shareowners and

Directors of Campbell Soup Company

We have completed an integrated audit of Campbell
Soup Company’s 2005 consolidated financial statements and
of its internal control over financial reporting as of
July 31, 2005 and audits of its 2004 and 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits,
are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and the related consolidated statements of
earnings, of shareowners’ equity (deficit) and of cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Campbell Soup Company and its
subsidiaries at July 31, 2005 and August 1, 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2005 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit of financial
statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective July 29, 2002, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment,
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of July 31, 2005 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore,
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of July 31, 2005, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated

Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control
over financial reporting in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control, and performing such other procedures as
we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
